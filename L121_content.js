# OMM: Lab 13 Prep - Lumbar HVLA and Posterior Counterstrain

## Lumbar Diagnosis Review
*   **Screening:** Identify posterior transverse processes to determine rotational freedom.
*   **Landmarks:**
    *   **12th Rib:** T12.
    *   **Iliac Crest:** L4-L5 interspace.
    *   **PSIS:** S2.
*   **Type 1 (Neutral):**
    *   Group curve.
    *   **Sidebending and Rotation in OPPOSITE directions.**
    *   Asymmetry does **NOT** improve significantly with flexion or extension.
*   **Type 2 (Non-Neutral):**
    *   Single segment.
    *   **Sidebending and Rotation in the SAME direction.**
    *   Asymmetry **IMPROVES** in either flexion or extension.
*   **Confirmation:** Induce lateral translation to determine sidebending freedom.

## Lumbar HVLA (High Velocity, Low Amplitude)
*   **Type:** Passive, Direct technique.
*   **Principles:**
    1.  Identify restricted segment.
    2.  **Always perform Soft Tissue first.**
    3.  Localize precisely to the restrictive barrier.
    4.  Apply HVLA thrust (quick, short distance) through the barrier.
    5.  Reassess.
*   **Contraindications:**
    *   **Absolute:** No somatic dysfunction, no consent, patient intolerance, **osteoporosis**, **osteomyelitis**, **fractures**, bone cancer, hardware in joint, severe **Rheumatoid Arthritis**.
    *   **Relative:** Acute whiplash/pain, pregnancy, post-surgical complications, **herniated discs**, anticoagulant use.
*   **Technique Setup (Lateral Recumbent):**
    *   **Type 1 (Neutral):** Long lever with rotational and sidebending emphasis.
    *   **Type 2 (Non-Neutral):** Long lever. Flex or extend hips/knees to localize to the specific segment.

## Posterior Lumbar Counterstrain
*   **Type:** Passive, Indirect technique.
*   **Tender Points:** Discrete areas of tissue texture abnormality and tenderness.
*   **Contraindications:**
    *   **Absolute:** Neuro/vascular symptoms induced by position, exacerbation of life-threatening symptoms.
    *   **Relative:** Inability to relax, severe illness, cervical instability (for cervical CS), apprehension.
*   **Tender Point Locations:**
    *   **Spinous Process (PL1-PL5):** On the **inferolateral** aspect of the spinous process of the dysfunctional segment.
    *   **Transverse Process (PL1-PL5):** On the **posterolateral** aspect of the transverse process of the dysfunctional segment.
*   **Treatment Position (Prone):**
    *   **Extension:** Lift the ASIS on the side of the tender point (extends the spinal level).
    *   **Rotation:** Rotate pelvis/lower segment **TOWARD** the tender point (lift ASIS).
    *   **Sidebending:** Sidebend **AWAY** from the tender point (adduct the lower extremity).
    *   **Mnemonic:** **E-SARA** (Extend, Sidebend Away, Rotate Toward - *Note: Rotation is of the segment, often achieved by rotating pelvis toward*). *Wait, the transcript says "rotate pelvis and lower segment toward and upper segment away"*. Let's stick to the transcript description: **Lift ASIS (Extend + Rotate Toward), Adduct Leg (Sidebend Away).**

    questions: [
        {
            question: "A patient presents with lower back pain. Diagnosis reveals L4 is rotated right and sidebent left. The asymmetry does not change with flexion or extension. What is the diagnosis?",
            options: [
                "L4 Flexed Rotated Right Sidebent Right",
                "L4 Extended Rotated Right Sidebent Right",
                "L4 Neutral Rotated Right Sidebent Left",
                "L4 Neutral Rotated Left Sidebent Right"
            ],
            answer: 2,
            explanation: "The rotation and sidebending are in opposite directions (Rotated Right, Sidebent Left), and the dysfunction does not improve with flexion or extension. This indicates a Type 1 (Neutral) somatic dysfunction: L4 N S(L) R(R)."
        },
        {
            question: "Which of the following is an ABSOLUTE contraindication to performing HVLA on the lumbar spine?",
            options: [
                "Acute lumbar strain",
                "Herniated disc without radiculopathy",
                "Osteoporosis",
                "Pregnancy"
            ],
            answer: 2,
            explanation: "Osteoporosis is an absolute contraindication due to the risk of fracture. Acute strain, herniated disc, and pregnancy are relative contraindications."

        {
            question: "For a Posterior Lumbar Counterstrain point located on the transverse process of L3 on the right, what is the correct treatment position?",
            options: [
                "Prone, Extend, Sidebend Toward, Rotate Away",
                "Prone, Extend, Sidebend Away, Rotate Toward",
                "Supine, Flex, Sidebend Toward, Rotate Toward",
                "Supine, Flex, Sidebend Away, Rotate Away"
            ],
            answer: 1,
            explanation: "Posterior lumbar tender points are treated in prone extension. The specific setup involves lifting the ASIS on the affected side (which extends and rotates the pelvis/segment toward the tender point) and adducting the leg (which sidebends the torso away from the tender point). So: Extend, Sidebend Away, Rotate Toward."

        {
            question: "What landmark corresponds to the level of the iliac crests?",
            options: [

                "L3-L4 interspace",

                "L5-S1 interspace"
            ],
            answer: 2,
            explanation: "The iliac crests are generally at the level of the L4-L5 interspace."
