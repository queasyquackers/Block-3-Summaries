Osteopathic Lumbar Diagnosis: Fryette’s 2nd Principle
When side bending is introduced into a non-neutral spine, the bodies of 
the vertebrae will rotate toward the side of concavity
Type II dysfunction
• Occur as a result of trauma/abrupt twisting
• Maintained by short restrictors – (rotatores
brevis and intertransversari muscles)
• Found at apex or extremes of Type I curves
Should be treated before Type I lesions

• Use anatomical landmarks to identify 
lumbar spine region.
• Use a screening approach to identify 
which segment you want to focus on 
diagnosing.
• Use landmarks figure out at which 
level (L1, L2, L3, L4, or L5) you 
palpate a somatic dysfunction
• Find the most posterior transverse 
process in the area.

PE: Feel / Palpate the lumbar region
◼ Check soft tissue for texture changes
◼ Areas of hyper/hypo-tonicity?
◼ Areas of tenderness?
◼ Color changes (sympathetic chain ganglia extend 
inferiorly to L2)
◼ Palpate bony landmarks

PE: Palpate Lumbar spine transverse 
processes (TP)
• Lumbar spine Transverse processes are about 1.5 inches lateral from 
midline (spinous processes). 
• Rotational segmental motion examination
• With Patient prone, physician places thumbs or fingers on TPs of 
segment to be tested.  
• Apply a firm pressure towards anterior of Patient’s body, (toward 
the table) one side at a time; Which TP does not move into rotation 
easily?  
• (The side that resists your downward/ anterior pressure = the side of the posterior TP = the 
direction of that vertebra’s rotation dysfunction. Named/ documented for which direction 
the anterior vertebral body is rotated)

• Planes of coupled motions
– Flexion & Extension = Sagittal Plane
– Rotation = Horizontal Plane
– Side bending = Coronal Plane

are Motion Guiding Structures,

Type II Dysfunctions
• Extended dysfunctions (ERS) “disappear” in extension and are accentuated 
in flexion. In extreme flexion when both posterior facets should open, one 
remains closed and the vertebra rotates and sidebends to that side.
• Flexed dysfunctions (FRS) “disappear” in flexion and are accentuated in 
extension. In extreme extension when both posterior facets should close, 
one remains open and the vertebra rotates and sidebends to the opposite
side.

Testing segment for Extension
- Have pt prop themselves 
up on their elbows 
(“SPHINX” or “TV 
WATCHING” to create 
extension to the segment 
being tested.
- Motion test segment ONE 
SIDE AT A TIME to see if 
asymmetry improved.

--- Page 18 ---
Department of Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine
Testing segment for Flexion
- Have patient bend 
forward on knees to flex 
lumbar vertebra 
(“CHILD’S POSE”). 
- Again, motion test 
segment ONE SIDE AT A 
TIME as previously 
described to see if 
asymmetry improved.

your elbows like you’re watching TV?”

Department of Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine
Type 2 Somatic dysfunction
• If a single segment (e.g. L3) is found to be restricted in motion, the 
transverse process that is more posterior (e.g. the right) is the same 
side that the segment would rotate (R) more freely towards.  
• If on testing the posterior segment becomes more symmetrical in 
flexion (F) or extension (E), then it is named for this “direction of 
ease” (i.e. segment became less posteriorin flexion).
• Using Fryette’s laws, this somatic dysfunction is a Type II spinal 
segment dysfunction, and 
• assume that side bending and rotation is coupled to the same side
• Our somatic dysfunction (SD) is L3 Flexed, Rotated and Sidebent to 
the right on L4 
• (name the dysfunction for how it moves on L4), or L3 FRS Right, or L3 F RrSr.

Fryette’s 1st Principle
• When side bending is introduced into a neutral spine, the bodies of the 
vertebra will rotate towards the side of convexity. This is an example of 
coupled motion in the vertebral unit.
Type 1 Dysfunction:
• group curves.
• neutral segments (no changes in rotation or sidebending during forward or backward 
bending; a.k.a. flexion or extension).
• rotation and side bending are to opposite sides.
• Formed gradually, usually as compensation. 
• Maintained by long paraspinal restrictor muscles – erector spinae.
• Type I group curves can either be a dysfunctional curve, or a normal adaptation to some 
other asymmetry or lesion in another region. (As in scoliosis due to unequal leg length).

Type 1 Somatic dysfunction 
Documentation
• On examination you find that the transverse processes of vertebral 
segments from L1 to L4 are posterior on the Left.  As you motion 
test in flexion and extension there is no change to the posterior 
transverse processes. 
• Your diagnosis would be notated as L1 -L4 Neutral Side bent Right 
and Rotated Left
• Properly documented as L1-L4 N Sr Rl
--- Page 25 ---
Department of Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine
Neutral Dysfunctions
• e.g. L1-L4 N S right R left
Neutral, Side bent Right, Rotated Left
• Group Dysfunction (three or more segments)
• May include thoracic spine segments
• Three or More Segments Have the Same Pattern
• Such as Side bent Right and Rotated Left
• Can involve Many Segments
• May be an adaptation

Biomechanics & Fryette’s 3rd Principle
Motion of a vertebra in any one plane of motion will influence 
motion of that same vertebra in any other plane of motion.

Lumbosacral Spring Test 
• Patient lies prone on examination table.
• Physician stands to the side with the 
• dominant eye over the midline.
• Physician places the palm of 1 hand over the
• midline of the lumbar region, with the thenar eminence of the hand over the 
lumbosacral junction (L5 & base of sacrum). The fingers extend superiorly over 
the spinous processes & paravertebral tissue.
• Physician provides a short quick push in an anterior direction with the 
heel of the hand and evaluates for compliance (“springiness”) or 
resistance of the lumbar spine.
1. Compliance of the lumbar spine with no resistance is described as a 
negative test.
2. Resistance (stiffness) to this springing motion is described as a positive test.

1. While standing beside/behind patient, physician contacts the segment with the 
most posterior TP by placing the thumb & index finger on the lateral aspects of the 
patient's TP’s
2. The other hand on the shoulder to induce motion of spine. 
3. If the TPs are most symmetrical with the patient in extension, then the vertebra is 
described as extended, sidebent, and rotated to the same side, for example, L1 
ERRSR.
4. If the TPs are most symmetrical with the patient in flexion, then the vertebra is 
described as flexed and will be sidebent and rotated to the same side, for example, 
L1 FRRSR.
5. If the TPs are most symmetrical with the patient in the neutral position, then the 
vertebra is described as neutral and will be sidebent and rotated to opposite sides, 
for example, L1-L3 NRRSL. This result also indicates that there is a group dysfunction 
present, and all vertebrae in this region where TART changes were found would be 
described in the same fashion. This may include the thoracic spine, for example, 
T11–L2 NRRSL. L2 would be the apex of a L1-L3 NRRSL. Whereas, L1 would be the 
apex of a T11-L2 group curve, since it demonstrated the most posterior transverse 
process or the greatest amount of restricted motion within this group of vertebrae.

Nomenclature - named for the easy direction 
(rather than the restricted direction)
Abbreviations are by Convention, specifying the Segment and then the Flexion/Extension, 
then
• For Type II Dysfunctions, Rotation and Side bending (L5 F RSL)  <i.e. F RLSL>
• If R is written before S, Rotation and Side bending are understood to be to the same side
• For Type I Dysfunctions, Side bending and then Rotation (L1-4 N SLRR) <i.e. N SLRR>
• If S is written before R, Rotation and Side bending are understood to be to the opposite sides 
(with the rotation specified by the last subscript)

Goals of Soft Tissue Techniques
• Relax muscles and fascia
• Improve circulation to muscles:
• Arterial: O2 and nutrition to areas of ischemia.  D.O. stands for Deliver Oxygen.
• Venous 
• Lymph drainage
• “ We suffer from two things: the want of supply and a burden of dead deposits” -Andrew Taylor 
Still.
• Improve mobility
• Decrease pain
• Interfere with progression to chronicity
• To relax the stretch reflex
Which is based on mu. spindle mechanism
