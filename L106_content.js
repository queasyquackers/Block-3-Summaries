**Lecturer:** B. Laurent, D.O.
**Session:** Lecture #106

## Part 1: Defining Health Disparities

### Definition
*   **Health Disparities:** Differences in the incidence, prevalence, mortality, and burden of disease and other adverse health conditions that exist among specific population groups.
*   **Key Factors:** Socioeconomic status, education, age, race, ethnicity, geography, disability, gender, ****** orientation.

### Examples of Disparities
1.  **Life Expectancy (2010-2020):**
    *   Highest: Asian/Pacific Islander.
    *   Lowest: Black population.
    *   *Note:* The gap has widened post-pandemic.
2.  **Maternal & Child Health:**
    *   **Preterm Births & Low Birth Weight:** Highest rates in Black populations, followed by Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders and American Indian/Alaskan Natives.
    *   **Maternal Mortality:** Black women have the highest pregnancy-related mortality (40.8 per 100k), followed by American Indian/Alaskan Natives (29.7).
    *   **Infant Mortality:** Highest in Black populations (10.8 per 1k).
3.  **Geography:**
    *   **"Where you live matters."**
    *   **Mississippi Delta:** Region with significant health challenges (where NYIT-COM Arkansas is located).
    *   **NYC Subway Study:** Life expectancy can vary by ~10 years depending on the subway stop (e.g., Lincoln Center vs. Harlem).

## Part 2: Cultural Competency vs. Cultural Humility

### Cultural Competency
*   **Definition:** Services that are respectful of and responsive to the health beliefs, practices, and cultural/linguistic needs of diverse patients.
*   **Critique:** Can be viewed as a "technical skill" to be mastered, potentially reinforcing stereotypes ("Cultural Competability").

### Cultural Humility
*   **Definition:** A lifelong process of self-reflection and personal critique.
*   **Key Aspect:** It is a **posture** of learning, not a destination. You cannot "master" every culture.

### The Process of Cultural Competency (Campinha-Bacote Model)
A Venn diagram of 5 overlapping elements:
1.  **Cultural Awareness:** Self-examination of one's own biases and prejudices. **Suspend Judgment.**
2.  **Cultural Knowledge:** Seeking sound educational foundation about diverse groups (understanding prevalence, treatment efficacy).
3.  **Cultural Skill:** Ability to collect relevant cultural data and perform culturally sensitive assessments.
4.  **Cultural Encounters:** Directly engaging with people from different backgrounds.
5.  **Cultural Desire:** The **motivation** to *want* to engage (vs. *having* to).

## Part 3: Culture and Health Outcomes

### Impact of Lack of Competency
*   Barriers to care (mistrust, fear of disrespect).
*   Poor adherence to medical advice.
*   Missed diagnoses (due to lack of knowledge of prevalence).
*   Harmful drug interactions (not asking about traditional remedies).

### Health Belief Model (Dimensions)
Understanding how a patient views their illness:
1.  **Perceived Susceptibility:** Do they think they can get sick?
2.  **Perceived Seriousness:** How severe do they think it is?
3.  **Perceived Benefits:** Do they believe the treatment will help?
4.  **Perceived Barriers:** What stops them? (Cost, stigma, shame).
5.  **Self-Efficacy:** Do they believe they can change their situation?

### Case Study: 33yo Pakistani Woman
*   **Presentation:** Vaginal discharge (Yeast infection).
*   **Underlying Issue:** Uncontrolled Diabetes (stopped insulin).
*   **Cultural Context:**
    *   **Shame/Isolation:** Diabetes meant she couldn't eat family meals (isolation).
    *   **Barrier:** Felt shame in using insulin.
    *   **Outcome:** Understanding her "lived experience" allowed for better coaching than just prescribing medication.

## Part 4: Cultural Proficiency Continuum

A spectrum of attitudes and practices:
1.  **Cultural Destructiveness:** Attitudes/policies that eliminate cultures (e.g., Genocide).
2.  **Cultural Incapacity:** Devaluing other cultures; belief in superiority of dominant group.
3.  **Cultural Blindness:** "I don't see color." Ignores the lived experience and distinct needs of different groups.
4.  **Cultural Pre-Competence:** Awareness of limitations, desire to improve, but imperfect responses.
5.  **Cultural Competence:** Acceptance and respect for difference; ongoing self-assessment.
6.  **Cultural Proficiency:** Holding culture in high esteem; advocating for systems change.`,
    questions: `**1. Which of the following best describes "Cultural Humility" as opposed to "Cultural Competency"?**

A. Mastering a specific set of facts about different cultures.
B. A lifelong commitment to self-evaluation and personal critique.
C. Achieving a state where one is "blind" to cultural differences.
D. Learning to speak the language of the patient population.
E. Knowing the specific disease prevalence for every ethnic group.

**Answer: B (A lifelong commitment to self-evaluation and personal critique)**

**Rationale**: **Cultural Humility** is defined as a dynamic, lifelong process focusing on self-reflection and critique, acknowledging that one cannot "master" another's culture. Cultural Competency is often critiqued for implying a finite skill set or checklist.

**2. According to the lecture, which population group in the US had the highest rate of pregnancy-related mortality (deaths per 100,000 births)?**

A. Asian / Pacific Islander
B. Hispanic
C. Non-Hispanic White
D. Black / African American
E. American Indian / Alaskan Native

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to Reveal Answer</strong></summary>

**Answer: D (Black / African American)**

**Rationale**: The data presented shows the **Black population** has the highest pregnancy-related mortality rate (40.8), followed by American Indian/Alaskan Natives (29.7).

**3. A physician claims, "I treat all my patients exactly the same, regardless of their race or background. I don't see color." On the Cultural Proficiency Continuum, this attitude is best described as:**

A. Cultural Destructiveness
B. Cultural Incapacity
C. Cultural Blindness
D. Cultural Pre-Competence
E. Cultural Proficiency

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to Reveal Answer</strong></summary>

**Answer: C (Cultural Blindness)**

**Rationale**: **Cultural Blindness** is the belief that culture makes no difference and that all people are the same. While often well-intentioned, it is harmful because it ignores the unique "lived experiences" and needs of different groups, potentially leading to unmet health needs.

**4. In the Campinha-Bacote model of cultural competency, which element refers to the "motivation" of the healthcare professional to want to engage in the process?**

A. Cultural Awareness
B. Cultural Knowledge
C. Cultural Skill
D. Cultural Encounters
E. Cultural Desire

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to Reveal Answer</strong></summary>

**Answer: E (Cultural Desire)**

**Rationale**: **Cultural Desire** is the motivation of the healthcare professional to *want* to, rather than *have* to, engage in the process of becoming culturally aware and seeking cultural encounters.

**5. A patient with diabetes is non-compliant with their insulin regimen. Upon further discussion, you learn that they feel isolated because they cannot eat the same meals as their family, and this "shame" prevents them from managing their condition. Which dimension of the Health Belief Model does this "shame and isolation" best represent?**

A. Perceived Susceptibility
B. Perceived Seriousness
C. Perceived Benefits
D. Perceived Barriers
E. Self-Efficacy

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to Reveal Answer</strong></summary>

**Answer: D (Perceived Barriers)**

**Rationale**: The patient's feelings of **shame** and **isolation** act as **Perceived Barriers** to adherence. They view the treatment (insulin/diet) as creating a social/emotional hurdle that outweighs the health benefit in their current mindset.
