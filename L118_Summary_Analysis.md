Key points
• Drug interactions can result from pharmacokinetic alterations (eg, changes in 
absorption, distribution, and elimination), pharmacodynamic changes (additive, 
synergistic, or antagonistic effects), or a combination of both.
• Coadministration of drugs that interact can:
1- Increase drug effect, causing toxicity, or 
2- Decrease drug effect leading to subtherapeutic levels. 
• Patient-specific factors and drug-specific factors influence the likelihood that a drug-
disease, drug-drug, drug-botanical, or drug-food interaction occurs.
• Mechanisms of drug interactions related to pharmacodynamics – therapeutic and 
toxic:  additive effects, synergistic effects/potentiation, antagonistic effects.
• Mechanisms of drug interactions related to pharmacokinetics: absorption, 
distribution/transport, metabolism, and excretion.

Students please note:
The following examples name specific drugs and their mechanisms of 
drug interactions.
You should be able to explain the mechanisms and effects.
You do not need to remember drug names at this time. You will learn the 
names and what they do later.
Items related to drug interactions on quizzes and exams will provide 
enough information to be able to identify mechanisms and effects. A 
crucial test-taking skill is to be able to select to specific clues needed to 
identify the correct answer.

Examples of Pharmacodynamic Drug-Drug Interactions (DDIs)
The effect of the interaction may be therapeutic or toxic.
Additive: Sum of the effect of each agent given alone
diphenhydramine + tricyclic antidepressants → additive anticholinergic side effects
• dry mouth, blurry vision, drowsiness, memory problems, constipation, difficulty urinating
nitroglycerin (for angina) + sildenafil (Viagra for erectile dysfunction) → cGMP vasodilation + cGMP 
degradation (Some resources designate this interaction as synergistic.)
• profound and potentially catastrophic hypotension - Dangerous
Synergy / Potentiation: Enhanced effect exceeds the sum of the effects of each agent given alone
codeine + acetaminophen → enhanced analgesic effect
• Beneficial: lower doses of each may be adequate for pain relief
sulfonamide (antibiotic) + trimethoprim (antibiotic) → different mechanisms enhance antibacterial action
• Beneficial: each drug alone has a bacteriostatic effect; together they are bactericidal
amoxicillin (antibacterial) + clavulanic acid (“bodyguard”) → enhanced antibacterial activity
• Beneficial: clavulanate inactivates bacterial enzymes that would hydrolyze the drug
methadone (opioid for OUD) + itraconazole (antifungal) → ventricular arrhythmia
• Both drugs cause QT interval prolongation on the ECG → torsades de pointes
10
OUD: opioid use disorder. Methadone is a mu opioid receptor full agonist.
Dangerous

Examples of PD DDIs by Antagonistic Mechanisms
11
Competitive antagonism: One drug competes with another drug for the active site
morphine (MOR agonist) + naloxone (MOR antagonist) → treatment of opioid overdose
• Both drugs bind the active site of mu opioid receptor (MOR). Naloxone blocks the receptor and 
prevents the opioid from activating the receptor → may cause abrupt withdrawal symptoms
nerve agent (poison) + atropine (anticholinergic) → treatment of cholinergic poisoning
• The nerve agent increases levels of acetylcholine neurotransmitter. Atropine blocks muscarinic 
receptors, which prevents the toxic effects of the overabundant acetylcholine.
Noncompetitive antagonism:  Interference by drug binding at allosteric site
ketamine (NMDA receptor antagonist) + glutamate (NMDA receptor agonist) → anesthesia / dissociation
• Ketamine binds to the ion channel without competing for the glutamate binding site → biologic 
response is blocked.
Physiologic antagonism: Opposite physiologic effects (opposite functions) / Unrelated mechanisms
• Insulin ( blood sugar) + prednisone (steroid,  blood glucose) → hyperglycemia (adverse effect)
• Insulin ( blood sugar) + glucagon ( blood glucose by hepatic synthesis) → reversal of hypoglycemia
Chemical antagonism: Compound directly binds and sequesters a drug, preventing distribution to the target
• Protamine combines with heparin in plasma, inactivating heparin → beneficial reversal agent
• Antacid chelates tetracycline (antibiotic) in the gut → reduces antibiotic efficacy

1. Drug A is taken orally to increase gastric pH. The absorption of Drug B requires an acid stomach 
for optimal absorption. What is the potential effect on blood levels when the two drugs are 
administered concomitantly? 
• PK absorption: Systemic levels of Drug B are decreased, which could reduce its therapeutic 
efficacy of the antifungal agent.
2. A drug that is a positive allosteric modulator enhances the inhibitory effects of a chloride ion 
channel in the CNS. Alcohol is also a positive allosteric modulatory at the same target acting at a 
different site. What is the likely adverse drug effect when the two chemicals are used simultaneously?
• PD: Synergistic CNS depressant effects may lead to death, especially when combined with a mu 
opioid agonist.
3. A patient is taking an antiplatelet drug following a heart attack and an anticoagulant due to recent 
knee replacement surgery. What is the potential adverse drug event that could result from this drug-
drug interaction?
• PD: Additive or synergistic effects can lead to potentially serious bleeding, including hemorrhagic 
stroke.

4. A patient with several comorbidities treated with various drugs is evaluated for an oral antiviral drug 
that contains a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor for the treatment of COVID-19. What effects may be 
anticipated when the antiviral is taken together with the patient’s chronic medications?
• PK metabolism: Inhibiting the metabolism of the concurrent drugs that are CYP3A4 substrates 
can lead to elevated blood levels of the substrate drugs and increase the risk of adverse effects. 
5. What can the prescriber do to mitigate the potential adverse effects of this DDI?
• Concomitant use of many other medications with this particular oral COVID-19 antiviral drug 
should be avoided. Prescribers should refer to published Drug Interaction information for 
prescribing guidance.
6. An 87-year-old patient with compensated congestive heart failure takes a medication that is a P-
glycoprotein substrate, has a narrow therapeutic window and potential for serious toxicity. She is 
evaluated for antibiotic therapy for a bacterial lung infection. The preferred drug is a P-glycoprotein 
inhibitor. What is the potential effect of this drug-drug interaction?
• PK distribution / excretion: P-gp inhibition decreases P-gp drug efflux by intestinal epithelial cells 
and decreases drug secretion into the proximal tubule, resulting in elevated blood levels of the 
heart drug. This interaction could lead to serious toxicity by the heart drug.
Test your knowledge: Explain the PK or PD mechanism of each.

7. A 57-year-old patient with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus takes an ACE inhibitor for its 
“renoprotective” effects by reducing glomerular filtration pressure, which reduces mechanical stress 
on the glomerular capillaries. Patient education (in easy-to-understand language) includes the 
caution that he should not take any over-the-counter pain medications (NSAIDs) that also decrease 
glomerular filtration pressure. What is the potential effect of this drug-drug interaction?
• Drug-disease interaction: NSAID use on its own increases the risk of kidney injury in patients 
with conditions like diabetic nephropathy. 
• PD interaction: NSAID in combination with an ACE inhibitor has synergistic negative effects that 
result in decreased glomerular filtration rate, which could lead to acute kidney injury in the 
vulnerable (at risk) patient. 
8. A patient with hypercholesterolemia who has not achieved goal lipid levels with statin therapy 
agrees to the addition of a bile acid sequestrant, which is a resin that forms a complex with bile 
acids (synthesized from cholesterol) in the gut. The drug-bile acids complex is excreted in the feces. 
The patient is advised to take the statin several hours after the resin. Why separate the 
administration of the two drugs by several hours?
• PK absorption: When taken at the same time, or near the same time, the resin (cholestyramine) 
sequesters many drugs in the GI tract – not only bile acids – preventing absorption and resulting 
in reduced blood levels and reduced efficacy of the orally absorbed drugs, such as statins.
Test your knowledge: Explain the PK or PD mechanism of each.

• Drug interactions occur when one drug modifies the actions of another drug in the body. 
• Drug interactions can result from pharmacokinetic alterations, pharmacodynamic changes, or 
a combination of both. 
• The pharmacodynamic characteristics of different drugs administered concomitantly may lead 
to additive, synergistic, or antagonistic effects.
• Pharmacokinetic interactions related to absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion may 
increase or decrease blood levels, resulting in potential toxicities or reduced efficacy, 
respectively.
• Strong inducers of CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein include carbamazepine, phenobarbital, 
phenytoin, rifampin, and St. John’s wort. 
• CYP1A2 isoenzymes are induced by tobacco/marajuna smoking.
• Clinically relevant CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein inhibitors include cimetidine, macrolide 
antibioitcs (erythromycin and clarithromycin), azole antifungal agents, ritonavir, grapefruit 
juice, and many more
• Exaggerated drug effects and other toxicities, as well as reduced efficacy can all lead to 
adverse drug events.
