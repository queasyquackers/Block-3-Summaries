00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,950
Welcome students to
the last lecture in

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:05,610
our foundational
pharmacology series,

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:08,410
Drug Interactions.
We've talked about

4
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:10,930
various mechanisms
of pharmacodynamic

5
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:14,010
actions, pharmacokinetic
actions. So

6
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,430
now we're going to
see how they apply

7
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,130
in drug interactions.
We'll talk

8
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:21,170
about mechanisms
and the effects.

9
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,410
Please contact me if
you'd like to chat about

10
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:29,390
pharmacology. Groups
and individuals are

11
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:31,990
welcome. we can do it
in person or by zoom.

12
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:35,910
Learning
objectives. I'm sure

13
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,330
you're familiar
with the concept

14
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,310
of learning
objectives by now.

15
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:43,490
This lecture will

16
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:46,270
demonstrate
how to classify

17
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,450
the drug interactions
to describe the various

18
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:52,250
mechanisms both
pharmacodynamic and

19
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:57,230
pharmacokinetic. I'll
be asking you to be able

20
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:01,290
to list by name
certain inducers and

21
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:04,850
inhibitors of the CYP3A4
and p-glycoproteins

22
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:11,090
and the effects of smoking
on the CYP1A family

23
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:13,610
and you should be
able to give examples

24
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:17,950
of drug interactions
both that cause that

25
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:21,770
are for beneficial
effect and those that

26
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:24,510
can cause adverse, can
increase the risk of

27
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:30,950
adverse effects, and
explain how these drug

28
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:34,950
interactions affect
the various tissues.

29
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:37,270
Mechanisms, mechanisms,

30
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:40,070
mechanisms, and effects.

31
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:45,230
I want to emphasize
that I give you a

32
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,430
number of learning
resources. You certainly

33
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:50,310
do not need to
study all of them.

34
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:55,960
Gain your knowledge by
whatever means works

35
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,770
for you. You don't even
have to watch these

36
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:01,750
videos if you don't
want to. You do need

37
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:04,650
to do the practice
questions. I require those

38
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:07,850
because they're going
to help you. They'll

39
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:11,110
help you become
familiar with exam style

40
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:13,470
questions. They'll help
you assess your own

41
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,750
knowledge. They'll
help you know what you

42
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:20,030
don't know and what you
do know and it gives

43
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:22,950
you an opportunity to
apply the concepts.

44
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:27,230
Some links if you wish to

45
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,350
use them and
some key points.

46
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:34,030
This gives you an
overview of what

47
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:37,830
the lecture is
about and also will

48
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:42,830
focus you on what
is needed to learn.

49
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:46,790
Knowledge of drug
-drug, drug-food, drug

50
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:49,650
-botanicals, drug
-disease interactions,

51
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:52,950
careful selection of
therapeutic alternatives,

52
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:56,510
and continuously
continuous monitoring

53
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,950
to identify adverse
effects could

54
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:02,590
reduce the risks of
adverse drug events.

55
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:09,730
Sometimes we have
drug-drug interactions

56
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:13,090
that are okay. We
might need to adjust a

57
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,610
little bit. Sometimes we
have drug interactions

58
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,510
that really should be
avoided and we need

59
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:20,870
to know what are the
alternatives that

60
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:24,950
can be prescribed in
the event that we have

61
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:27,550
a drug interaction
that should be avoided.

62
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:34,070
Here is a scheme
from the Goodman

63
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:35,470
and Gilman
Pharmacological

64
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:38,070
Basis of Therapeutics
textbook.

65
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:41,690
It's divided into the
pharmacokinetic and

66
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:44,770
pharmacodynamic mechanisms.
The pharmacokinetic

67
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:47,790
mechanisms appear on
the left-hand side,

68
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:49,710
absorption, distribution,

69
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,210
metabolism, elimination,

70
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:57,550
and the interactions
can affect an overall

71
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:00,670
increase or
decrease in plasma

72
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:04,170
concentration. An increase
in plasma concentration

73
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:07,130
increases the risk
of adverse effects.

74
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:12,050
A decrease increases
the potential that

75
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:14,830
the drug will not
be fully effective.

76
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,890
Excuse me. Go back.

77
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,450
Pharmacodynamic
mechanisms.

78
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:25,470
We have drugs that
increase the overall

79
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:29,030
effect, additive synergistic
potentiation. I want

80
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:31,090
to point out that
the terms synergistic

81
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:34,390
and potentiation are commonly
used interchangeably,

82
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,380
and I will use them
interchangeably.

83
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:40,530
Goodman and Gilman
indicates here how they

84
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,170
can be differentiated
from each other,

85
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:46,190
but the differentiation
is really tiny.

86
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:49,610
An additive effect is
the combined effect

87
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:52,230
of two drugs equals the
sum of the effect of

88
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:54,530
each agent given
alone. In other words,

89
00:04:54,530 --> 00:05:00,310
if a patient is getting
drug A and drug A is

90
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:04,090
doubled, then it will
be a double effect.

91
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:08,310
If a person is getting
drug A and drug B

92
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:11,270
and the two drugs do
the same thing, that

93
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,990
will be a double effect,
an additive effect.

94
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:16,870
Synergy is the combined
effect exceeds the

95
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:20,590
sum of the effect of
each drug given alone.

96
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:23,850
So it's a greater
effect than the

97
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:27,050
sum of the two, an
enhanced effect.

98
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:32,880
Some antagonistic
mechanisms are,

99
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,630
I'm going to say
receptor first.

100
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:39,470
Receptor mechanisms
blockade of the

101
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:42,150
effect of one drug
by the other that

102
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:45,490
competes at a common
binding site or a

103
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:47,710
drug that acts at
an allosteric site,

104
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:50,470
which will block the

105
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:53,390
effect of the other drug.

106
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:58,830
A physiological
antagonist is two drugs

107
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:02,670
that produce opposite
functional effects.

108
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,610
It's about the
function on this one.

109
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,170
And I'll give examples
of that. I've given

110
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:13,070
examples before, and
we will revisit that.

111
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:15,870
Keep pushing the
wrong button.

112
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:21,670
And chemical antagonism
is just a direct

113
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:24,810
reaction between two
chemicals. A chemical

114
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:27,710
and a drug, for
example, are two drugs.

115
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:35,590
I'm giving you a
number of examples of

116
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:39,290
the mechanisms and
the effects, and I

117
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:41,670
will be using drug
names in these

118
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:44,650
examples because that's
how you're going to

119
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:48,290
meet them in life
and your practice.

120
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:51,410
You should be able
to explain the

121
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:55,110
mechanisms and effects.
You do not need to

122
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:58,110
remember the drug
names at this time.

123
00:06:58,470 --> 00:06:59,910
Later, yes.

124
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:07,510
The point is, one
of the points is, to

125
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:11,150
help you be able to
pick out the specific

126
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:15,150
clues in questions,
quizzes and exams,

127
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:20,090
that will help you to
identify the answers.

128
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:26,630
Sometimes students
get lost in the drug

129
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:30,850
names and forget to
notice the actual clues.

130
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:34,190
So I encourage you
to read carefully,

131
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:36,850
discern what's important

132
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:40,450
information, and
focus on that.

133
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:47,050
Beginning now with
the pharmacodynamic

134
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,310
mechanisms of
drug interactions.

135
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:51,690
So additive first,
the sum of the

136
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:53,610
effect of each
agent given alone.

137
00:07:54,690 --> 00:08:00,050
Diphenhydramine is
Benadryl, and it

138
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:01,830
has a number of
different actions. We

139
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:04,510
always think about
it in terms of its

140
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:06,250
effects at blocking
the actions of

141
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,270
histamine, but it
does other things too.

142
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:11,670
And tricyclic
antidepressants, we think

143
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:16,410
about their effects for
alleviating depression,

144
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:19,470
but it has other
actions too. And in

145
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:23,550
fact, the actions of
diphenhydramine and

146
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:28,050
tricyclic antidepressants
on the cholinergic

147
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:31,450
system are the same.
So, anticholinergic

148
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:34,520
side effects.
Both drugs cause

149
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,010
anticholinergic side
effects, use them together,

150
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:39,490
it increases the risk
of anticholinergic

151
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:42,130
side effects. So,
what is the meaning?

152
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:44,590
What kind of side effects
are anticholinergic?

153
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:49,390
Dry mouth, Blurry
vision, drowsiness,

154
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,470
memory problems,

155
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:55,830
confusion, inability
to concentrate,

156
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,960
constipation, and
difficulty urinating.

157
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:03,130
So those are
very difficult

158
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:05,330
for patients to tolerate.

159
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:12,230
nitroglycerin
plus the erectile

160
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:14,870
dysfunction drug viagra
and all the others

161
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:19,010
for that matter
both increase levels

162
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:21,910
of nitric oxide
by different

163
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:27,350
mechanisms and nitric
oxide is a powerful

164
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,910
vasodilator. So
the two together

165
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:35,630
can cause profound,
potentially

166
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:38,370
catastrophic hypotension.

167
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:41,830
Hypotension causes
patients to fall.

168
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:47,170
This is categorized
as additive. I want

169
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,090
to mention you may
have heard of it in

170
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:53,330
other contexts as
being synergistic. The

171
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:56,650
literature doesn't
seem to agree on this.

172
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:01,530
Now, synergy and
potentiation, the

173
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:03,870
enhanced effect
exceeds the sum of the

174
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,750
effects of the two
drugs given alone.

175
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:11,210
So, codeine and
acetaminophen are a

176
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,730
really fine example
of this, common.

177
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:18,270
Codeine is an opiate
painkiller, and

178
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:22,150
acetaminophen is
Tylenol, for mild to

179
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:25,010
moderate pain.
Together, they enhance

180
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:27,810
the analgesic effect
of each other.

181
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:32,270
Another benefit
besides improved pain

182
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:36,630
relief is that lower
doses may be enough.

183
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:40,850
Lower doses of each
drug may be enough

184
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:43,190
to produce the pain
relief. So lower

185
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:47,170
doses is a good thing.
We remember that the

186
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:52,810
potential for side
effects is increased

187
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:55,550
with increasing
doses, by and large.

188
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:59,670
The next example
is a sulfonamide, a

189
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:03,110
sulfa drug, together
with another drug

190
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:06,800
called trimethoprim.
They work at different

191
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,870
places on the same
pathway, but so

192
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:12,590
different mechanisms.
And used together,

193
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:15,910
they enhance
antibacterial action.

194
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:17,850
Additionally,

195
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:21,470
they are less likely,
or I should say

196
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:24,910
it takes more steps,
for the organism to

197
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:27,350
develop resistance
against the drugs.

198
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:32,290
The third one down,
amoxicillin, is

199
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:36,670
an antibacteria
drug, an antibiotic.

200
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:39,550
I'm sure you're
probably familiar with

201
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:44,390
it. and clavulanic
acid, I put here in

202
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,870
quotes, a bodyguard.
That's kind of how I

203
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:51,230
think about it, produces
enhanced antibacterial

204
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:53,810
activity. Clavulanic
acid doesn't have

205
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:57,650
much antibacterial
activity of its own,

206
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:01,550
but it will protect
the amoxicillin from

207
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:05,430
being broken down by
bacterial enzymes.

208
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:07,490
And therefore,
that enhances

209
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:09,850
the amoxicillin
activity. So,

210
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:12,930
enhanced antibacterial
activity.

211
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:16,010
Obviously, this is
a beneficial effect.

212
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:21,810
And now, methadone,
which is a drug for

213
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:25,510
opioid use disorder,
plus itraconazole,

214
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:28,590
which is an antifungal,
commonly used,

215
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:32,450
together can cause
ventricular arrhythmia.

216
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:36,250
and this ventricular
arrhythmia

217
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,590
is called
torsade de point

218
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,130
which is indicated
right here

219
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,110
and you don't have to
be a cardiologist to

220
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:49,010
recognize that this ekg
tracing looks bad it

221
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:52,030
is quite dangerous it's
a ventricular arrhythmia

222
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,710
and it's called
torsade de point the

223
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:59,470
twisting of the points
because of these various

224
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:02,190
it's like about like
a ballet this is a

225
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:07,010
ballet term twisting of
the points both of these

226
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:12,630
drugs increase the qt
interval on the ecg

227
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:15,430
qt is this part

228
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:40,510
some antagonistic
mechanisms

229
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:43,010
will do competitive
non-competitive

230
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:44,650
physiologic and chemical.

231
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:49,090
Examples of competitive
antagonism are

232
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:52,950
morphine and the
antidote naloxone.

233
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:58,130
Morphine is a mu opioid
receptor agonist.

234
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:01,370
Naloxone is a mu opioid
receptor antagonist.

235
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:04,810
It's easy to see they
work at the same site.

236
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:07,890
Naloxone is
effective in the

237
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:10,450
treatment of
opioid overdose.

238
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:15,830
They act now Now,
there is a potential

239
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:18,290
adverse effect of this
combination, and that

240
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:23,670
is that use of naloxone
can induce abrupt

241
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,930
withdrawal symptoms.
So that's just

242
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:31,960
something that needs to
be managed when saving

243
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:34,770
someone's life from
an opioid overdose.

244
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:41,530
another example is a
nerve agent which is

245
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:45,690
a poison plus
atropine which is an

246
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:48,470
anticholinergic i
mentioned anticholinergics

247
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:51,530
before it blocks a
cholinergic receptor

248
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:56,690
called the m3 receptor
and atropine is used

249
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:59,550
in the treatment
of this nerve agent

250
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:02,810
poisoning because it
will block the effect

251
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:07,220
of the acetylcholine
that's released, that

252
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:10,590
accumulates, and it
will block the effects

253
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:13,770
on the various
muscarinic receptors.

254
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:18,550
It's actually
M1 through M5.

255
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:23,510
And non-competitive
antagonism, I'm sure

256
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:26,270
you remember that
mechanism, so it's binding

257
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:29,070
of a drug to an
allosteric site, the

258
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:35,230
point is it can still
block the effect of

259
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:37,850
the agonist. And the
common example used

260
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:40,150
here is ketamine.
You may have heard of

261
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:44,590
ketamine. It's long been
used as an anesthetic,

262
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:46,970
recently been used
in the management

263
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:50,010
of depression, and it
is a drug of *****.

264
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:53,230
So ketamine, which
is known as an NMDA

265
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:57,590
receptor antagonist,
will block the effects of

266
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:01,530
glutamate, which is
the neurotransmitter.

267
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:06,690
So that is therapeutic
for its anesthetic

268
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:10,270
effect, but an adverse
effect of this combination

269
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:14,210
that actually occurs
when it's used for

270
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:18,910
anesthesia or for
depression is a dissociative

271
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:23,130
effect and you'll
learn about that when

272
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:25,950
we get to talking about
the drug ketamine.

273
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:31,230
Physiologic
antagonism is as I

274
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:33,790
mentioned previously
functional.

275
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:38,250
It's the opposite
physiologic effect that

276
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:41,490
occurs the opposite
function. The typical

277
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:47,070
example is insulin, which
is a natural hormone

278
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:50,610
and also used as a
drug, and glucagon,

279
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,990
a natural hormone and
also used as a drug.

280
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:57,790
So insulin
causes the uptake

281
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:01,670
of blood glucose
into cells.

282
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:04,930
Glucose increases
blood glucose by

283
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:08,010
stimulating hepatic
synthesis. So one is

284
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:10,510
reduction of blood
sugar, the other is

285
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:13,990
increase in blood sugar.
Why would glucagon

286
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:17,330
be used? It will
be for reversal of

287
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:20,210
hypoglycemia. Now,
we also have a drug

288
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:24,150
interaction with
regard to blood

289
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:26,830
glucose. So insulin,
we know what that is.

290
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:30,670
Prednisone is a
steroid in a class

291
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:33,750
called glucocorticoid.
It's a powerful

292
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,270
drug for management
of inflammation.

293
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:42,030
insulin decreases
blood sugar, prednisone

294
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:46,970
increases blood sugar,
and that effect of

295
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:50,450
prednisone on the
blood glucose can lead

296
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:54,590
to hyperglycemia in
patients. Long-term

297
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:57,390
use of prednisone,
especially higher doses,

298
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:00,710
is known to cause
hyperglycemia, which

299
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:05,410
can actually move into
diabetes mellitus.

300
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,870
Chemical antagonism,
that's just the

301
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:12,470
direct binding of
one on the other.

302
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:17,310
The common example is
protamine, which is

303
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:22,130
a cationic substance
that combines with

304
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:25,310
heparin, just a one
-on-one, and activates

305
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:28,430
heparin by preventing
it from getting

306
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:31,670
to the site of action
and carries it away.

307
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:35,530
So that's a beneficial
reversal agent.

308
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:41,150
Antacids, something
like Mylanta, Tums,

309
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,070
chelates, tetracycline,
which is an

310
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:46,390
antibiotic, and it
happens in the gut because

311
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:49,070
the antacid stays
in the gut, and that

312
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:53,290
reduces the antibiotic
from being absorbed,

313
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:56,170
which, of course, will
reduce blood levels,

314
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:59,430
which will reduce
antibiotic efficacy.

315
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:11,290
So that's actually also a

316
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:13,740
pharmacokinetic
mechanism, that last one.

317
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,440
So mechanisms,
absorption,

318
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,800
distribution,
metabolism, excretion,

319
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:22,220
absorption, sequestration
of a drug in the

320
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,660
gut, as we said with
the antacid and the

321
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:29,500
tetracycline, or
increased gastric pH for

322
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:33,100
drugs that require an
acid pH for absorption.

323
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,060
So if absorption is
decreased, that's

324
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,380
going to reduce the
therapeutic effect.

325
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,280
Distribution.

326
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,520
Well, changes in
volume of distribution.

327
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:45,640
So that's a drug
-disease interaction.

328
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:52,920
Drug-disease related
to distribution.

329
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,620
And that can affect
the amount of drug in

330
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:02,220
plasma, which will
affect the amount of drug

331
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:06,820
that reaches the site
of action so depending

332
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:09,200
on what's happening
what the particular

333
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,620
drug interaction is it
can increase the risk

334
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:15,480
of adverse effects or
reduce the therapeutic

335
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,080
efficacy now P
glycoprotein this is going

336
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,480
to come up over and
over and over and over

337
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:29,700
because it is such an
important ABC efflux

338
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:34,040
transporter, ATP-using
efflux transporter.

339
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:38,780
So if we inhibit
p-glycoprotein,

340
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:42,840
which effluxes
drugs, it pushes

341
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:46,000
them out of the
bloodstream,

342
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:50,180
that can increase
systemic drug

343
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,620
levels and that
can increase

344
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,240
the risk of
adverse effects.

345
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:57,200
Induction is
also possible.

346
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,060
Metabolism inhibiting
or inducing drug

347
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,200
metabolizing
enzymes may decrease

348
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,320
or increase clearance,
respectively,

349
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,740
affecting the
risk of adverse

350
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,440
effects or
therapeutic effect.

351
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:15,400
Excretion, same concepts
here, inhibiting

352
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,700
the secretion of a
drug into the nephron,

353
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,320
and I've indicated
some transporters here,

354
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:24,580
OATs, organic anion
transporters, organic

355
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:27,480
cation transporters,
can decrease the

356
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,480
clearance. It's not
getting into the kidney,

357
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,160
so it stays in the
bloodstream, and that

358
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,760
can increase the risk
of adverse effects.

359
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:41,080
So let's see now
if you can answer

360
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,620
these questions.
Activating key

361
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:47,720
transcription factors
and increasing

362
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,960
the expression of
cytochrome P450.

363
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,920
What does that do?

364
00:21:56,340 --> 00:22:02,100
Induction, so a drug,
let's say drug B,

365
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:10,800
that induces metabolism
by activating these

366
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,800
transcription factors
and increasing the

367
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:19,780
expression of CYPs or
UGTs or whatever will

368
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:26,060
increase the rate of
metabolism of drug A

369
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:30,840
and that in turn will
decrease the amount of

370
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,780
drug that actually
gets into the systemic

371
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:36,740
circulation. So decreased
bioavailability,

372
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:43,060
and that will potentially
reduce efficacy.

373
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:46,660
Now, competitive
binding of drugs to the

374
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:52,200
P450 heme iron. So
competitive inhibition.

375
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:55,540
I just gave
away the answer.

376
00:22:55,820 --> 00:23:00,140
So this is a very, very
common mechanism of

377
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:04,600
drug-drug interactions,
drug B competing at

378
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:09,750
the CYP or the UGT or
whatever metabolizing

379
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:13,680
enzyme for the substrate.
And that's going

380
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:18,100
to reduce the rate
of metabolism of the

381
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:22,700
substrate. And that
can increase the
bioavailability,

382
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,680
increased levels
in the bloodstream,

383
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,240
can increase the risk
of adverse effects.

384
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,780
Now,

385
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:33,240
covalent interaction
with P450 hemoiety

386
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:38,220
or the protein itself
is known as what?

387
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:42,960
It's called suicide
inhibition. Why

388
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,120
suicide? Because
that enzyme is

389
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,080
taken out of
commission permanently.

390
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,140
So how is the function
of these enzymes

391
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:58,460
regained? Well, the cell
has to make new enzymes

392
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:02,800
and set them out there
ready for action.

393
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,420
And that takes time.

394
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:13,480
This is a scheme to
help you understand

395
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,820
the actual mechanism
of the induction of

396
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:21,160
drug metabolizing enzymes,
drug enters a cell,

397
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,400
obviously, interacts
with nuclear

398
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,760
receptor, and that's
going to induce gene

399
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:31,700
transcription, and that
will increase mRNA and

400
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:34,940
protein synthesis.
They go together. And

401
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,400
that will increase
the rate of metabolism

402
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,260
because there are now
more enzymes available

403
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:47,020
to metabolize the
substrate, and that

404
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,940
will decrease the
concentration of the

405
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:52,820
substrate drug in the
systemic circulation.

406
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:56,560
The result, the
effect, to decrease the

407
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,960
pharmacologic action
of the substrate drug,

408
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,880
and for some, the
inducer even itself,

409
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:06,280
plus increase the
concentration of reactive

410
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,460
metabolites.
If the drug is

411
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:12,240
metabolized to
reactive metabolites,

412
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:17,280
toxic metabolites,
that can exacerbate

413
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:20,620
that metabolite
-mediated toxicity.

414
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,400
Please don't
forget that point.

415
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:29,020
Okay, our starred
drugs now. These are

416
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,840
drugs that, yes,
I'm asking you to

417
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,520
memorize them. They
will be coming up

418
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:38,240
over and over and
over, and they will

419
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,460
become second nature
to you. So now

420
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,720
would be a good time
to start on them.

421
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,880
I've put some mnemonics
down here that

422
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:51,460
artificial intelligence
came up with for me.

423
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:54,800
Please feel free
to make your own

424
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:59,140
mnemonics, whatever
works. So the CYP3A4

425
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:03,140
and P-glycoprotein
inducers are these

426
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:11,880
anti-seizure drugs,
phenytoin, carbamazepine,

427
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:16,000
phenobarbital,
this antibiotic,

428
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:21,160
rifampin, and
this botanical,

429
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:25,120
so it's available
over the counter.

430
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,360
St. John's
wort, people do

431
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,580
that to make
them feel better.

432
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,020
It supposedly has
antidepressant effects.

433
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:37,540
So phenytoin, carbamazepine,
phenobarbital,

434
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:39,260
rifampin, and
St. John's wort.

435
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,440
AI came up with
precision care

436
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,000
promotes robust
scientific journeys.

437
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:49,840
I'm also bringing to
your attention CYP1A2.

438
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,700
CYP1A2. It's not
a big piece of the

439
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:56,060
metabolism pie, but
it's an important piece.

440
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,180
CYP1A2 is widely
expressed in the liver.

441
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:03,440
CYP1A1 is
expressed in other

442
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,620
tissues and also
can be induced.

443
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:11,720
Smoking. Smoking of
cigarettes, *********

444
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:23,380
will increase exposure
to these compounds,

445
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:28,140
polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons. I put a picture

446
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,960
of them down here.
You can see these are

447
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:35,400
these flat six-membered
circles stuck together.

448
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,300
So PAH is, of course,
it has an acronym.

449
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:44,320
These are metabolized
by CYP1A2, and they

450
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:48,240
can form procarcinogens.
The smoking itself

451
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:55,800
will induce CYP1A2,
which will induce

452
00:27:55,800 --> 00:28:00,040
the metabolism of the
substrates. Not only

453
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:05,340
these compounds, but
also drugs. And a big

454
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:09,780
drug that we think
about is Clozapine.

455
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:13,360
Clozapine is an
antipsychotic drug. It's

456
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:17,320
quite efficacious, very
efficacious, but it

457
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,320
has some pretty serious
adverse effects.

458
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,540
Patients who are
taking clozapine for

459
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:31,760
schizophrenia or
other types of

460
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:39,180
problems will have an
increase in the rate

461
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:42,360
of metabolism if
they are smokers.

462
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,380
Now, why does this
matter? Because the doses

463
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:49,060
can be adjusted
according to the person's

464
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:52,140
smoking habit. Well,
if they find themselves

465
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,220
in a situation where
they're not able to

466
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:56,520
smoke, such as if they're
in the hospital or if

467
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:05,420
they quit smoking,
then the dose of the

468
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:07,820
clozapine is going to have
to be adjusted downward

469
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:12,760
as the CYP1A2 system
returns to normal.

470
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,300
Let me see if
I can clarify

471
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,160
that explanation
a little bit.

472
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:23,960
But the CYP1A2
is induced by

473
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,220
cigarette smoking,
which means

474
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:30,820
we get more CYPs
available to

475
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:34,520
metabolize their
substrates. And this is

476
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:39,860
true for any enzymes
that are induced. once

477
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:43,060
the inducer is removed
in this case the

478
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:49,020
smoking then the number
of the enzymes will

479
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:53,780
return to normal or
the the pre-induced

480
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:57,620
level now if a patient
is taking clozapine

481
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:00,080
a ****** is taking
clozapine and the

482
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:05,100
dose has been adjusted
according to the

483
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,820
person's smoking
activities so they get the

484
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:11,880
therapeutic blood
levels, if that person

485
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,640
stops smoking for any
reason, such as going

486
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,500
into the hospital
where smoking is not

487
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:22,780
allowed, those enzymes
will reduce in number

488
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:27,120
back to their pre
-smoking concentration.

489
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:30,460
Now, the patient is
on the Clozapine at

490
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:32,840
this higher dose,
because of the induction,

491
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:38,500
this higher dose will
produce higher blood

492
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:43,640
levels once those
CYP1A2 enzymes return

493
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,520
to their original
concentration.

494
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,680
Therefore,

495
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:51,840
clozapine doses must
be adjusted downwards

496
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:54,260
in patients who
stop smoking.

497
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:56,060
I hope I was able to make

498
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,540
that clearer for you.

499
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:11,450
inhibition now of drug
metabolizing enzymes.

500
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:13,830
It's basically the
same concept as we

501
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:18,650
talked about for
pharmacodynamic mechanisms.

502
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:22,450
Drugs or the reactive
intermediates could

503
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:26,030
be one or both that
bind to the active site

504
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:28,460
or an allosteric site
of drug metabolizing

505
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:31,030
enzymes will decrease
the catalytic enzyme

506
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:33,910
activity of the enzyme
for the substrate.

507
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:36,370
And some mechanisms
are competitive

508
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:39,190
inhibition of the
CYP heme iron. We

509
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:41,550
talked about that.
Non-competitive

510
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:43,830
binding to the allosteric
site, preventing

511
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:45,810
binding to the
substrate. We talked

512
00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:48,490
about that. And
suicide inhibition

513
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:54,530
that irreversibly binds
to the drug metabolizing

514
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:58,210
enzyme. Covalent
binding with the heme

515
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:00,890
that's in there.
Covalent binding to the

516
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:04,670
protein part of the
enzyme or anything that

517
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:08,590
can cause a fragmentation
of the protein.

518
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:10,770
So that's just a recap.

519
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:16,310
So some CYP3A4
inhibitors. You

520
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:18,150
notice these have
stars on them.

521
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:20,590
These are commonly
used drugs.

522
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:23,950
You should be aware
of them. There are

523
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:28,490
so many, many, many
CYP3A4 inhibitors out

524
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:31,070
there. I've just
picked out some strong

525
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:35,610
ones that are commonly
used. So cymetidine

526
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:37,910
is an over-the
-counter antacid. It's

527
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:40,550
called Tagamet. It's
also called cymetidine.

528
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:42,970
It is available
generically, and

529
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:47,510
many people take it
to calm stomach acid.

530
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:50,590
Ytriconazole is
an antifungal

531
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:53,090
agent and a strong CYP3A4

532
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,100
inhibitor and also
p-glycoprotein.

533
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:59,130
Erysromycin,
clarissromycin. These

534
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:00,810
are commonly
used antibiotics.

535
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:02,050
I'm sure you've
heard of them.

536
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:04,410
They're in the
macrolides class.

537
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:06,190
Ritonavir.

538
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,650
Ritonavir we are going
to be talking about

539
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:13,890
later on. It's a very
important drug for

540
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:17,230
its pharmacokinetic
effects, actually, more

541
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:20,830
so than for its
therapeutic effects. It is

542
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:24,710
called a pharmacokinetic
enhancer, and I

543
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:27,470
want you to be familiar
with this concept.

544
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:35,170
It is one of the strongest
CYP3A4 inhibitors

545
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:38,990
out there, and it
is used specifically

546
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:42,490
for the purpose
of increasing the

547
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:46,150
bioavailability and half
-life, thus duration,

548
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:50,490
of certain CYP3A4
substrates. not

549
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:53,870
all, but specific ones.
So I put this graph

550
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:59,390
here to remind you
about what happens

551
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:03,110
when we inhibit the

552
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:05,570
metabolic process
of a drug.

553
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:09,670
So both lines are
the same drug,

554
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:12,830
the CYP3A4
inhibitor, whatever

555
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:15,110
it is we're
talking about.

556
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:17,650
And this would be

557
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:22,670
representative
of the half

558
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:25,790
-life without
the ritonavir.

559
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:30,770
Peak concentration
rapidly drops.

560
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:34,230
With ritonavir,

561
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:38,870
and let's just
pretend this is

562
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:42,510
the minimum
therapeutic effect.

563
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:45,030
Okay.

564
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:48,270
So we can see it
drops below at this

565
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:54,290
point in time with
ritonavir inhibiting the

566
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:58,830
enzyme that degrades
this mystery drug

567
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:04,770
we see the half-life
increases and the

568
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:08,370
duration above the
therapeutic minimum

569
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:12,310
therapeutic efficacy
line is much longer

570
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:15,850
see this difference
in time right here.

571
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:21,190
So that is why it's
called a pharmacokinetic

572
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:24,190
enhancer. You may
have also heard it

573
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:27,250
as a booster,
pharmacokinetic booster.

574
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:30,850
So it increases
peak concentrations

575
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:35,850
and half-life of
CYP3A4 substrates.

576
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:38,290
In this example, the peak

577
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:41,870
concentration is
the same, but this

578
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:44,410
could theoretically
be here.

579
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:48,690
Now grapefruit
juice, well

580
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:51,490
that's not a
drug. It's a food.

581
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:54,470
I personally love
grapefruit juice.

582
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:56,290
Many people love
grapefruit juice.

583
00:35:56,410 --> 00:36:00,430
Well grapefruit juice
has a substance in

584
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:06,170
it that is a CYP3A4
inhibitor and hence that

585
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:10,330
is why the recommendation
is to never take

586
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:13,030
any drugs together
with grapefruit juice

587
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,950
that's just to be on
the side to err on the

588
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:19,690
side of caution but
so many drugs of

589
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:22,970
cyp3a4 substrates that
it's better to just

590
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:25,630
avoid grapefruit juice
whenever anybody's

591
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:32,130
taking medication period
i put a mnemonic down

592
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:34,730
here that ai helped
me with clinical

593
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:37,990
insights enhance care
research grows clinical

594
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:41,930
insights enhanced care
research grows i've

595
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:51,070
been talking about
various cyps and a piece

596
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:53,110
of the pie and we
saw this earlier so

597
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:56,150
i'm bringing it back
now the fraction of

598
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:58,710
clinically used drugs
metabolized by the major

599
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:01,030
phase one and phase
two enzymes based

600
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:04,470
on the literature the
relative size of each

601
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:07,030
pie section represents
the estimated

602
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:10,250
percentage of drugs
metabolized by each of

603
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:13,650
them. So on the top,
we have our phase one,

604
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:17,070
CYPs. We also
have esterases

605
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:19,910
and epoxide
hydrolases indicated

606
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:21,850
here. They're
also phase one.

607
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:27,850
Others. Here's our
CYP1A family, tiny,

608
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:32,250
but important.
They're all important.

609
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:36,750
CYP3A4, it's nearly half,

610
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:40,530
that's a lot of
drugs, CYP2D6,

611
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:43,390
we'll be talking,
we talked

612
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:44,790
about that in
pharmacogenomics,

613
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,670
pretty decent
size of the pie,

614
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:50,350
lots of important
drugs, and so on.

615
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:53,990
Here we have phase
two enzymes, our

616
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:57,930
UGTs, our UDP
glucuronaciltransferases,

617
00:37:57,930 --> 00:37:59,590
or
glucuronaltransferases,

618
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:05,710
is the greater portion
of the pie, and

619
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:07,690
the others are also
still important.

620
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,370
Let's talk about the drug

621
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:15,190
-disease interactions now.

622
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:18,550
Some therapies can
worsen existing

623
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:20,670
medical
conditions. So some

624
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:22,610
drugs can worsen
hypertension,

625
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:26,030
can interfere with
antihypertensive drugs.

626
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:28,790
some lots of drugs
go through the liver

627
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:32,270
some drugs can can
exacerbate liver disease

628
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:35,310
or kidney disease
or heart disease a

629
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:38,690
peripheral vascular
disease diabetes so

630
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:42,170
drugs that cause increased
blood glucose are

631
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:47,070
going to exacerbate
diabetes drugs that

632
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:51,450
are irritating to the
stomach peptic ulcer

633
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:55,950
disease drugs that
increase levels of

634
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:59,830
uric acid in the blood
can aggravate gout.

635
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:04,770
Drugs that can inhibit

636
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:06,770
breathing can
aggravate asthma.

637
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:09,770
Hypo or hyperthyroid
problems, and

638
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:10,990
there are special
problems of the

639
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:13,950
elderly. So I've
indicated down here.

640
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:17,970
Older individuals are
twice as likely as

641
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:20,650
younger adults to have
adverse drug reactions.

642
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:29,690
All our physiology
changes as we become an

643
00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:34,250
older adult, elderly,
and that can increase

644
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:37,360
adverse drug reactions,
adverse drug events,

645
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:40,050
and seven more
times likely to be

646
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:44,050
hospitalized of an
adverse drug event. These

647
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:50,540
patients tend to have
more comorbidities, and

648
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:53,670
are on drug therapies
with multiple drugs.

649
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:57,110
So all of that increases
the risk of adverse

650
00:39:57,110 --> 00:40:01,490
drug reactions and
adverse drug events.

651
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:07,070
So let's test our
knowledge now.

652
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:13,310
I suggest that you
might want to pause the

653
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:14,990
video in order to
have a look at these

654
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:17,450
questions, think about
them, see if you can

655
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:21,290
answer them without
looking back, and if you

656
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:24,310
can, then certainly
look back, then stop

657
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:27,650
looking, and then say
the answer out loud. Drug

658
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:31,350
A is taken ****** to
increase gastric pH.

659
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:37,150
The absorption of
drug B requires an

660
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:39,650
acid stomach for
optimal absorption.

661
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:42,790
What is the
potential effect on

662
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:44,350
blood levels when
the two drugs

663
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:45,990
are administered
concomitant?

664
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:53,130
Well, this is a
pharmacokinetic

665
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,620
mechanism of action.

666
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,410
Systemic levels of
drug B are decreased,

667
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:03,100
which could
result in reduced

668
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:05,400
therapeutic efficacy
of the antifungal

669
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:08,120
drug, which is
drug B by the way.

670
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:13,400
A drug that is a
positive allosteric

671
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:16,520
modulator enhances
the inhibitory effects

672
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:19,960
of a chloride ion
channel in the CNS.

673
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:23,200
Alcohol is
also a positive

674
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,640
allosteric modulator
at the same

675
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,620
target but at a
different site.

676
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:33,200
So they both have the
same effect. What is

677
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,240
the likely adverse
drug effect when the

678
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:38,240
two chemicals are used
simultaneously? In

679
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:44,890
this case, it's synergy.

680
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:47,850
Synergistic CNS
depressant effects

681
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:49,410
may lead to
death. This is a

682
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:51,490
common, common,
unfortunately,

683
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:55,870
drug combination that
does lead to adverse

684
00:41:55,870 --> 00:41:59,690
outcomes and death.
So it's important that

685
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:02,070
you understand the
combination of a

686
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:05,190
benzodiazepine and alcohol,
which is what we're

687
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:09,970
talking about here,
and especially a mu

688
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:16,750
-opioid receptor agonist
with it, an opioid.

689
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:21,610
A patient is taking
an antiplatelet drug

690
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:25,450
following a heart attack
and an anticoagulant

691
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:28,210
due to recent knee
replacement surgery.

692
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:31,190
What is the potential
adverse drug effect

693
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:32,930
that could result
from this drug-drug

694
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:36,070
interaction. So you know
what platelets do. So

695
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:40,050
an antiplatelet reduces
what platelets do,

696
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:44,650
and an anticoagulant
reduces coagulation.

697
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:48,790
So this is
pharmacodynamic, an

698
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:51,050
additive or synergistic
effect that can

699
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:53,730
lead to potentially
serious bleeding,

700
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:56,870
including
hemorrhagic ******.

701
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:04,170
Patient with several
comorbidities treated

702
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:06,810
with various drugs is
evaluated for an oral

703
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:11,110
antiviral drug that
contains a potent CYP3A4

704
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:13,650
inhibitor for the
treatment of COVID-19.

705
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:17,730
What effects may be
anticipated when the

706
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:19,790
antiviral is taken
together with the

707
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:22,790
patient's chronic
medications? So I didn't

708
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:24,650
mention what the
chronic medications

709
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:28,250
are. We're talking
about the potential.

710
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:30,830
Depending on what
the patient is

711
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:33,170
taking, we always
need to be thinking

712
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:35,590
about that first
and then checking.

713
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:39,250
This is a pharmacokinetic

714
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:41,870
metabolism mechanism.

715
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:44,810
Inhibiting the metabolism
of the concurrent

716
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:48,450
drugs that are CYP3A4
substrates can lead to

717
00:43:48,450 --> 00:43:51,050
elevated blood levels
of the substrate drugs

718
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:54,110
and increase the risk
of adverse effects.

719
00:43:55,650 --> 00:43:57,690
What can the
prescriber do to

720
00:43:57,690 --> 00:43:59,750
mitigate the potential
adverse effects

721
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:01,820
of this drug
-drug interaction.

722
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:07,070
Concomitant use of
many other medications

723
00:44:07,070 --> 00:44:10,470
with this particular
oral COVID-19 antiviral

724
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:13,210
drug should be avoided.
This happens to be

725
00:44:13,210 --> 00:44:17,550
a so-called black box
warning from the FDA.

726
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:20,190
Prescribers should
refer to published drug

727
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:23,030
interaction information
for prescribing

728
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:26,550
guidance. So what this
prescribing guidance will

729
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:29,450
tell you is whether
or not the drug can be

730
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:34,230
given together, possibly
dose adjustment.

731
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:36,490
And if the drugs can't
be given together,

732
00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:39,970
then you're going to
have to have knowledge

733
00:44:39,970 --> 00:44:43,750
to recognize what
alternatives there may be.

734
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:48,150
An 87-year-old patient
with compensated

735
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:50,690
congestive heart failure
takes a medication

736
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:54,390
that is a p-glycoprotein
substrate has a narrow

737
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:57,410
therapeutic window
and a potential for

738
00:44:57,410 --> 00:45:00,790
serious toxicity notice
those three features

739
00:45:00,790 --> 00:45:05,210
p-glycoprotein efflux
narrow therapeutic

740
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:09,850
window potential for
serious toxicity she's

741
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:13,810
evaluated for antibiotic
therapy for bacterial

742
00:45:13,810 --> 00:45:16,950
lung infection. The
preferred drug is a

743
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:19,870
P-glycoprotein
inhibitor. What is the

744
00:45:19,870 --> 00:45:22,510
potential effect of this
drug-drug interaction?

745
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:27,030
So this is
pharmacokinetic again.

746
00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:30,750
Remembering that P
-glycoprotein is expressed

747
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:34,830
in the intestinal tract
and it pushes drug

748
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:39,670
out of the endothelial,
I mean the intestinal

749
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:41,950
epithelial cells
back into the lumen.

750
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:48,010
It's located in the
liver at the area where

751
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:50,930
drug gets pushed into
the biliary system,

752
00:45:50,930 --> 00:45:53,750
which then goes back
into the intestine.

753
00:45:54,470 --> 00:45:57,070
And it's naturally
at the blood

754
00:45:57,070 --> 00:45:58,430
-brain barrier,
but that's not

755
00:45:58,430 --> 00:45:59,970
what we're
talking about now.

756
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:03,270
And in the kidneys.

757
00:46:03,270 --> 00:46:05,710
So it's located
in nephrons,

758
00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:08,230
and it actually
pushes drug

759
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:11,090
into the nephron
for excretion.

760
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:16,690
So by blocking p
-glycoprotein, we are

761
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:20,240
reducing all that efflux
activity, which can

762
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:25,050
increase the amount
of drug that gets

763
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:28,710
into the systemic
system, increasing blood

764
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:31,390
levels. this drug has
a narrow therapeutic

765
00:46:31,390 --> 00:46:34,830
window and a high
potential for toxicity.

766
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:39,090
So even a small
increase in blood levels

767
00:46:39,090 --> 00:46:43,030
can significantly
increase the risk of

768
00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:46,550
adverse, actually an
adverse drug event.

769
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:53,430
A 57-year-old patient
with long-standing

770
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:55,890
type 2 diabetes
mellitus takes an ACE

771
00:46:55,890 --> 00:46:58,370
inhibitor, an angiotensin
-converting enzyme

772
00:46:58,370 --> 00:47:03,730
inhibitor, for its what
is called reno-protective

773
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:07,130
effects, reno
referring to kidney, by

774
00:47:07,130 --> 00:47:10,130
reducing glomerular
filtration pressure,

775
00:47:10,710 --> 00:47:14,390
which, in turn,
reduces mechanical

776
00:47:14,390 --> 00:47:17,350
stress on the
glomerular capillaries.

777
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:20,350
Patient education,
which of course would

778
00:47:20,350 --> 00:47:23,050
be an easy-to-understand
language, includes

779
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:25,470
the caution that
the patient should

780
00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:28,390
not take any over-the
-counter pain medications

781
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:31,550
known as NSAIDs
like ibuprofen or

782
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:35,270
Aleve that also decrease
glomerular filtration

783
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:40,530
pressure. So we
have the medication

784
00:47:40,530 --> 00:47:45,470
prescribed medication
that's reducing

785
00:47:45,470 --> 00:47:48,970
glomerular filtration
pressure and the painkiller

786
00:47:48,970 --> 00:47:51,370
that's reducing
glomerular filtration

787
00:47:51,370 --> 00:47:53,970
pressure. So what
do you think is the

788
00:47:53,970 --> 00:47:56,170
potential effect of
this drug interaction?

789
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:01,460
Well, this is a drug
disease interaction.

790
00:48:01,470 --> 00:48:04,470
Number one, the patient
has long-standing

791
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:08,150
diabetes mellitus, and
that is the disease.

792
00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:11,350
The NSAID on its
own can increase the

793
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:13,710
risk of kidney injury
in these patients.

794
00:48:14,290 --> 00:48:17,990
And it's a pharmacodynamic
interaction

795
00:48:18,590 --> 00:48:21,630
because of the
synergistic effects

796
00:48:21,630 --> 00:48:24,030
of the NSAID and
the ACE inhibitor,

797
00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:26,590
the synergistic
negative effects,

798
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:29,290
on glomerular
filtration rate,

799
00:48:29,290 --> 00:48:31,370
which could lead
to acute kidney

800
00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:33,810
injury in the
vulnerable patient.

801
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:44,290
Last question.

802
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:50,210
I think it's the last
question. A patient

803
00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:52,370
with hypercholesterolemia
who has not

804
00:48:52,370 --> 00:48:55,010
achieved goal lipid
levels with statin

805
00:48:55,010 --> 00:48:57,910
therapy agrees to the
addition of a bile acid

806
00:48:57,910 --> 00:49:00,530
sequestrant, which
is a resin that forms

807
00:49:00,530 --> 00:49:04,130
a complex with bile
acids in the gut.

808
00:49:04,330 --> 00:49:07,710
The drug bile acid's
complex is excreted in

809
00:49:07,710 --> 00:49:10,650
the feces. The patient
is advised to take

810
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:13,050
the statins several
hours after the resin

811
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:18,210
because the resin can
also sequester drugs.

812
00:49:18,410 --> 00:49:20,650
Why separate the
administration

813
00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:23,130
of the two drugs
by several hours?

814
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:29,450
This is pharmacokinetic,
obviously.

815
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:33,030
When taken at the same
time or near the same

816
00:49:33,030 --> 00:49:37,430
time, the resin will
sequester many drugs,

817
00:49:37,490 --> 00:49:40,510
not only bile acids,
preventing absorption

818
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:42,470
and resulting in
reduced blood levels and

819
00:49:42,470 --> 00:49:44,830
reduced efficacy of
the ****** absorbed

820
00:49:44,830 --> 00:49:48,590
drugs such as statin.
This is a situation that

821
00:49:48,590 --> 00:49:52,170
can be overcome by
separating the dosing

822
00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:54,890
of the two drugs. So
the cholesteiromene

823
00:49:54,890 --> 00:49:58,090
has a chance to move
through the gut before

824
00:49:58,090 --> 00:50:00,810
the statin is taken.
And the statin will be

825
00:50:00,810 --> 00:50:04,690
absorbed in the proximal
small intestine.

826
00:50:10,790 --> 00:50:12,370
And now our summary.

827
00:50:13,930 --> 00:50:16,030
Drug interactions
occur when one drug

828
00:50:16,030 --> 00:50:18,130
modifies the actions
of another drug.

829
00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:20,270
Drug interactions
can result from

830
00:50:20,270 --> 00:50:22,090
pharmacokinetic
alterations,

831
00:50:22,090 --> 00:50:24,390
pharmacodynamic changes,
or a combination.

832
00:50:24,970 --> 00:50:28,150
Pharmacodynamic
characteristics of the

833
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:31,010
different drugs
administered can lead to

834
00:50:31,010 --> 00:50:33,830
additive synergistic or
antagonistic effects.

835
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:36,450
Pharmacokinetic
interactions are related

836
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:38,230
to absorption
distribution metabolism

837
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:41,710
excretion and may
increase or decrease

838
00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:43,830
blood levels depending
on what's actually

839
00:50:43,830 --> 00:50:45,830
happening, depending
on the mechanism.

840
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:49,590
Strong inducers
of CYP3A4 and P

841
00:50:49,590 --> 00:50:52,130
-glycoprotein include
carbamazepine,

842
00:50:52,270 --> 00:50:54,560
phenobarbital, phenytoin,

843
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:56,010
rifampin, and
St. John's Wort.

844
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:00,550
CYP1A2 isoenzymes
are induced by

845
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:02,870
tobacco and also
********* smoking.

846
00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:06,370
Clinically relevant
CYP3A4 and p

847
00:51:06,370 --> 00:51:09,350
-glycoprotein inhibitors
include cimetidine,

848
00:51:09,470 --> 00:51:11,470
the macrolite
antibiotics,

849
00:51:11,470 --> 00:51:13,570
erythromycin and
clarithromycin,

850
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,590
azole antifungals,

851
00:51:16,090 --> 00:51:17,190
ritonavir,

852
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:21,210
grapefruit juice,
and many more.

853
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:23,730
Exaggerated drug
effects and other

854
00:51:23,730 --> 00:51:26,350
toxicities, as well
as reduced efficacy,

855
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:30,050
can all lead to
adverse drug events.

856
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:33,210
And I separated
this out in a little

857
00:51:33,210 --> 00:51:35,010
chart for you,
a flow diagram.

858
00:51:36,610 --> 00:51:38,790
And here are the
test your knowledge

859
00:51:38,790 --> 00:51:42,310
questions. And
that concludes

860
00:51:42,310 --> 00:51:45,650
the drug
interactions lecture.
