00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,850
Welcome students
to the Pharmacology

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:04,590
of Antibiotics. In
this lecture we will

3
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:07,310
describe the
protein synthesis

4
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:09,950
inhibitors. This is
Dr. Goldstein speaking.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,640
Here are the
learning objectives.

6
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,780
On the right hand
side I'm trying

7
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,220
to help you
understand what these

8
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,640
learning objectives
are eliciting.

9
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,320
Mechanisms,
mechanisms, mechanisms.

10
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,180
I suggest you
chunk concepts

11
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:32,960
together because
it's a lot

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,720
easier to remember
a few things

13
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:41,120
that include
related ideas than

14
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,970
a bunch of
individual details.

15
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:47,500
And I invite you to
apply your knowledge,

16
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,590
preparation
materials and links,

17
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:59,530
and key points. This
is the same slide as

18
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:02,610
in the aminoglycosides
lecture. I have a

19
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:05,790
picture in the upper
right-hand corner of a

20
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:10,650
ribosome, bacterial
ribosome, with the protein

21
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:15,550
synthesis machinery
indicated in colors

22
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:19,410
and here are key points
that you're going

23
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:22,410
to need you can use
this as a summary you

24
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,930
can use it as an overview
you can use it to

25
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,250
help you in your
review any any way you

26
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:32,710
like to use it it's up
to you as you can see

27
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:37,210
there are numerous
drugs in this protein

28
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:40,650
synthesis group, protein
synthesis inhibitor

29
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:48,490
group, and here we
have a little mind map

30
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:52,290
of the groups. We have
our broad spectrum,

31
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,170
chloramphenicol and the

32
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:56,290
tetracycline, the
moderate spectrum,

33
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,910
just the macrolides,
the other

34
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,810
group is ketolides
have been

35
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:03,370
discontinued, and
the narrow spectrum,

36
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,730
lincosamides
and linezolid.

37
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:09,190
This is a newer group.

38
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,650
I'm not going to
be giving you the

39
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:14,070
pharmacology on
that because I doubt

40
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,250
that it will be
on the boards. You

41
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,070
might see it in
clinical practice and

42
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:19,940
you'll be able to
pick it up easily.

43
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:27,220
this is a little scheme
a little pictorial

44
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:32,230
to help you visualize
the different

45
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:34,970
mechanisms I'll go into
them in more detail this

46
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:37,010
might be something
that helps you in your

47
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:40,610
review and you can
draw it out maybe copy

48
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:43,850
the drawings and see
how the drugs work

49
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:48,430
antibiotic resistance
mechanisms we have

50
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:52,030
gone over before that
the concepts are the

51
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:56,410
same you can apply them
to the protein synthesis

52
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:59,860
inhibitors as you did
for other antibiotics

53
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:04,590
intrinsic resistance
microorganism just

54
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:07,550
will not be responsive
to a drug no matter

55
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:10,890
what and acquired
resistance in which an

56
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:14,750
organism was initially
responsive but then

57
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:18,570
has acquired various
mechanisms that allow

58
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:21,750
it to survive in the
presence of the drug.

59
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:27,830
Frequent or long-term
use of a particular

60
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:31,330
drug increases the
risk of microbial

61
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:35,690
mutations that produce
resistance. It is up

62
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:40,630
to all of us, on a
patient-to-patient basis,

63
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:43,110
to combat resistance
by following

64
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:50,130
stewardship guidelines
and educating patients,

65
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:54,290
encouraging patients
through knowledge

66
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:58,130
to help us out with
combating resistance.

67
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:03,930
we'll begin with the
tetracyclines this is

68
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:07,410
an old group it's in
fact the third group

69
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:09,890
of antibiotics to have
been commercialized

70
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:13,510
in the 20th century
sulfanilamide was

71
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:18,070
first and then came
penicillin and then the

72
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:21,470
tetracyclines erythromycin
followed maybe

73
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,840
five years later in
1952, and then the

74
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,310
cephalosporins about
10 or 12 years later.

75
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:33,350
I put STARS on the
important drugs to know.

76
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,870
Well, they're all
important to know

77
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:38,510
eventually, but for now,
this is all you need

78
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:41,590
to know. They are
likely to be tested

79
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:43,670
on the boards. You're
likely to see them

80
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:46,810
in clinical practice,
And they demonstrate

81
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,760
the concepts of
the tetracyclines.

82
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,910
Class pharmacokinetic
properties.

83
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:58,130
A few things I want
to point out is the

84
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:02,030
bioavailability of
tetracycline is good.

85
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:05,100
Doxycycline and
minocycline, about 100%.

86
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:09,930
Doxycycline and
minocycline are

87
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:11,650
not, sorry,
tetracycline are

88
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:14,470
not metabolized.
The others are.

89
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,330
Toxycycline is excreted

90
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:18,990
in feces, not urine.

91
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:25,690
No renal adjustment
and dosing is needed.

92
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:29,790
The half-lives
vary, actually,

93
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:31,070
according to the drug.

94
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,070
Tigacycline's
got a long half

95
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:36,490
-life. This is in
IV only, and it's

96
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:38,870
for serious
infections only.

97
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:42,290
Protein binding,
pretty high,

98
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,290
widely distributed
in body fluids.

99
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:45,840
That's what we
would expect.

100
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:49,730
Deposits in growing
bones and tooth enamel.

101
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:54,030
Hence, tetracyclines
have traditionally been

102
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:57,210
contraindicated in the
pregnant individual

103
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:00,390
and young children.
Children less than eight

104
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:03,420
years old. This will
be on the boards or

105
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,710
potentially be on the
boards. I don't know if

106
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:09,250
it would be on your
exam, but it could be.

107
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:12,570
Now, I've put a circle
around this part.

108
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:16,630
Doxycycline has
a relatively

109
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:18,510
low affinity for calcium.

110
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,150
The American College
of Pediatrics now

111
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:25,610
recommends that
doxycycline can be used

112
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:29,350
in young children and
pregnant people if

113
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:33,350
it is for 21 days or
less. And doxycycline

114
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:38,530
is usually less.
It's 7, 10, 14 days.

115
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,590
Tetracyclines that
remain in the gut

116
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:46,130
lumen, like
tetracycline, which

117
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:51,910
has 25%, could stay
in the gut lumen,

118
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:54,730
will modify the
intestinal flora.

119
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:57,290
And that said,
all antibiotics

120
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:58,770
actually can do that.

121
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:01,330
Getting back
to the calcium

122
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:04,510
issue, chelation
in the GI tract by

123
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:06,690
the dye and
trivalent cations

124
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:11,010
will prevent the
drug from being

125
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:13,030
absorbed, reduce the

126
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:15,870
bioavailability,
reduce the efficacy.

127
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:21,230
Antacids, mineral
supplements given at the

128
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:24,610
same time, so they have
to be separated. it.

129
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:30,350
These drugs can cause
nausea, vomiting,

130
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:33,590
so taking them with
food would be nice,

131
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:36,230
wouldn't it? That can
help, but you can't

132
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:40,010
take tetracycline, the
original dameclacycline,

133
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:43,650
or this newer one,
with food. But

134
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:48,090
you can doxycycline,
menocycline, and this

135
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:50,590
newer one. They can
be taken with food

136
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:54,070
and that can ease up
the nausea problem.

137
00:07:56,090 --> 00:08:00,910
Picture of teeth
stained by tetracycline

138
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:04,450
when this individual's
mother took it

139
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:07,030
during pregnancy or
possibly the child

140
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:10,170
was given it and
so the tetracycline

141
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:15,470
chelated with the
calcium, complexed

142
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:19,490
with the calcium in
the growing permanent

143
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:22,870
teeth. And that's
what it looks like.

144
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:26,290
Mechanism of action.

145
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:28,170
Down here.

146
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:34,330
So think tetracycline,
the small ribosome,

147
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:38,810
the 30S ribosome, and
the first spot. Small

148
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:42,550
and first, tetracycline.
So tetracycline

149
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:47,170
binds to the 30S
ribosome at the acceptor

150
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:53,630
site, the A site, and
that will block the

151
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:57,410
incoming tRNA from
binding. So it doesn't bind

152
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:00,230
here, and if it doesn't
bind, it therefore

153
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:03,450
cannot add any amino
acids to the growing

154
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:06,550
chain, and protein
synthesis is stopped.

155
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:10,170
These are irreversible.
Sorry, reversible.

156
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:12,030
reversible

157
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:24,570
resistance we have some
important mechanisms

158
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:28,870
of resistance this is
mnemonics i made up

159
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:32,150
maybe you can think
of something better so

160
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:36,090
tech k k looks like an
e like an x stands for

161
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:41,350
efflux tet k staphylococcus
resistance to

162
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,250
tetracycline what are
we thinking about with

163
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,130
staphylococcus. We're
thinking about MRSA.

164
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:49,750
Okay, we know MRSA
is resistant to a

165
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,470
lot of things and
now we have TETK

166
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:53,910
making it resistant
to tetracycline.

167
00:09:55,310 --> 00:10:00,130
We have TETAE, so
think about aerobic

168
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:02,690
enteric, that would
be gram negative,

169
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,370
efflux pump,

170
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:09,770
tetracycline,
doxycycline, minocycline,

171
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:12,190
but not the newer
ones. Now we

172
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:14,010
have something
called ribosomal

173
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:18,430
protection proteins.
So a protein is placed

174
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:20,810
on the ribosome
or the ribosome.

175
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:27,470
So the ribosome will
now not bind to the

176
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:30,770
drug. It's a ribosomal
protection protein.

177
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:34,810
So resistance occurs
through this TET

178
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:37,530
-M. I'm suggesting
M is in ribosome

179
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:39,170
and maybe that'll
help you remember.

180
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:42,330
Strep, staph,
enterococcus,

181
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:43,610
you notice gram positive,

182
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:46,390
tetracycline,
doxycycline,

183
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,590
menacycline, but not
the newer agents.

184
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:55,770
Intrinsic resistance,

185
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:58,590
pseudomonas, here
we go again, and

186
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:02,970
also proteus,
because they express

187
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:06,030
multi-drug resistant
efflux pumps.

188
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:09,210
You notice the MDR
multidrug resistance

189
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:13,190
these organisms
are resistant to

190
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:15,770
a number of different
antibiotics.

191
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:24,940
So what is it good
for if the common

192
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:27,530
infections are not
responsive to the

193
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:30,070
tetracyclines? Well it
would be a lot easier

194
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:31,970
to remember what
it's good for than

195
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:35,430
going down a litany of
all of the resistance.

196
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:36,650
We went through
the resistance

197
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:39,830
mechanisms, we talked
about the gram positive

198
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:41,950
and gram negative
that are resistant.

199
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:48,510
Doxycycline is the
most commonly used drug

200
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:53,010
in the group by far.
So zoonotic infections,

201
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:55,810
doxycycline,
zoonotic, doxycycline,

202
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:58,870
zoonotic. I bolded some
that you really should

203
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:01,870
know for this
course, Lyme disease,

204
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:04,950
which is caused by the
spirochete borrelia,

205
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:09,250
because Lyme's disease
is endemic in this

206
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:12,010
area of the Northeast,
and it's spreading.

207
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:14,850
Plague,

208
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:20,850
30% to 50% of
the population in

209
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:26,170
Europe in 1348
was decimated by

210
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:28,430
plague in a short
amount of time.

211
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:33,790
It's deadly, caused
by Yersinia pestis.

212
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:38,290
And FYI, five people
have died of plague

213
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:42,370
in the United States
in the 21st century.

214
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,310
So it hasn't gone
away. But it can

215
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:47,990
be treated with
doxycycline. The

216
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:51,550
idea is to recognize
it and treat

217
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,970
early, and people
will recover.

218
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:56,890
Rocky Mountain spotted
fever is caused by

219
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:00,610
this obligate
intracellular rickettsia.

220
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:02,310
It is deadly.

221
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:06,290
Doxycycline is
first line, and it's

222
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:09,390
only one of two drugs
that's effective.

223
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:14,390
Tularemia. This is
rabbit fever. It's

224
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:16,430
got a bunch of
different names as well.

225
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:21,350
And doxycycline is
one of the treatments

226
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:23,450
we saw before that
aminoglycosides

227
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:25,850
are also treatments
for tularemia.

228
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:31,030
Respiratory infections.
Community-acquired

229
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:34,230
pneumonia. rhinosinusitis.
So here are the

230
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,190
respiratory bugs that
we've gone over before.

231
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:39,450
Haemophilus influenzae,

232
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,410
Marcella catarralis,

233
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:45,590
Mycoplasma pneumoniae,
and Chlamytophilin

234
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:49,210
pneumoniae. And these
are the atypical.

235
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:56,710
So zoonotic, respiratory,

236
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,310
skin GI.

237
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,850
So think about
the organ systems.

238
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:11,630
You have to make
sure that the

239
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:14,550
organisms are
sensitive, MSSA and

240
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:17,190
MRSA, we remember
the potential

241
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,530
resistance there to
common infections,

242
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:21,570
cholera,

243
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:24,730
peptic ulcer disease.

244
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:27,110
Now let's talk
about the STDs,

245
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:28,950
******** transmitted
diseases.

246
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,690
I'm going to bring your

247
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:33,070
attention here
to ********.

248
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:39,070
******** caused
by the spirochete

249
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:41,790
treponema pallidum is

250
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:44,210
normally treated
with penicillin.

251
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:49,590
Recall that there is
a penicillin G form

252
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:52,130
called benzothine penicillin
which can be given

253
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:55,730
as one shot and it
will produce an effect

254
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:59,700
for 14 to 28 days and
that's certainly convenient

255
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:03,650
for treating ********,
one shot. Well,

256
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:09,110
look at doxycycline
now. It has to be given

257
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:15,890
twice a day for
14 to 28 days.

258
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:20,490
And what is the
chances of a

259
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,250
person sticking
to that therapy?

260
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,990
So that's why besides
penicillin being

261
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:28,950
highly active, it's
also much more likely to

262
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:31,690
be effective because
of that time frame.

263
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:33,850
And then malaria.

264
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,310
What else do we
want to talk about?

265
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:38,410
Chlamydia.

266
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:43,190
So all of these various
******** transmitted

267
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:45,350
diseases are caused
by chlamydia.

268
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,310
So it's only two.
I don't have any

269
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:51,230
of them bolded,
but you should know

270
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:53,670
trepidema causes
******** and the

271
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:56,630
chlamydia causes
various infections.

272
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,370
Remember, this is an

273
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:00,210
atypical. It's
a chlamydia.

274
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,580
Tigacycline now.
So this is for

275
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:11,800
complicated infections,
serious infections.

276
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,040
The big story
with tigacycline

277
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,020
is it's broad
spectrum and it's got

278
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:20,440
some important
contraindications.

279
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,920
So I'll let you
look at all of these

280
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,200
different therapeutic
uses. I want to draw

281
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,370
your attention to the
contraindications.

282
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,900
Do not use for
hospital-acquired

283
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,360
pneumonia.
Healthcare-acquired

284
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,520
pneumonia, like in
the nursing home,

285
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:40,080
ventilator
-associated pneumonia.

286
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:48,000
Because there's
lower efficacy, lower

287
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:54,600
cure rates, and
increased mortality.

288
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,440
With regard to
demeclocycline, and this

289
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,760
is the only takeaway
with this drug,

290
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,820
It's rarely, if ever,
used anymore. It

291
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,580
never was used
for its antibiotic

292
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,540
properties because
it causes something

293
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:14,900
called nephrogenic
diabetes insipidus.

294
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,640
Diabetes insipidus
is a water-losing

295
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:26,250
problem because the
kidneys are not reabsorbing

296
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,760
free water in the
collecting tubules.

297
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,600
It's just going out
when it should be

298
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:35,440
reabsorbed. And this
is because the kidneys

299
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,420
now are insensitive
to the hormone that

300
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,840
puts the water channels
into the collecting

301
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,440
tubules to reabsorb
that free water.

302
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,460
And it has, and
that hormone, by the

303
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:56,630
way, is called
antidiuretic hormone.

304
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,540
Antidiuretic
hormone. and that's

305
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:02,400
stored in the
posterior pituitary.

306
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:09,060
Therefore, demeclocycline
historically was

307
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:12,240
used for syndrome of
inappropriate anti

308
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,300
-diuretic hormone. But
we have selective drugs

309
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:20,430
now that are used instead
of demeclocycline.

310
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,780
It's all about
this nephrogenic,

311
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:24,960
meaning in the kidney,

312
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:28,880
diabetes insipidus,
which is a water-losing

313
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:35,200
problem because of
insensitivity to ADH.

314
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,540
Secondary infections,
naturally,

315
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,700
we have some things
going on in the

316
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,500
kidney with
increased blood urea

317
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,980
nitrogen, which is
called azotemia.

318
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,100
Interestingly, about
outdated tetracycline,

319
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:58,440
Something called
Fanconi syndrome,

320
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:06,120
which is a renal
acidosis, can occur when

321
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:10,820
outdated tetracycline
is consumed.

322
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,280
We should not be
taking outdated

323
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,420
drugs to begin
with. We think of

324
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,860
them as being likely
to be ineffective,

325
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:21,400
and that's
usually the case.

326
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,620
However,
tetracycline became

327
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:27,460
toxic when it
became outdated, and

328
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:29,360
it caused this
renal acidosis.

329
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:33,220
This is not likely to
be much of a problem

330
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,800
anymore since tetracycline
itself is hardly

331
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,400
ever used, but it's
an important idea to

332
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:44,820
remember, and the boards
are likely to test it.

333
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,240
We talked about bones
and teeth, chelation

334
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,500
of calcium. We
talked a little about

335
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,980
GI, the nausea,
vomiting, secondary

336
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:57,540
infection. Also, the
non-C. diff diarrhea.

337
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:03,880
Photosensitivity.
Here is a problem that

338
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,140
patients need to be
cautioned about because

339
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:14,180
it can cause this
sunburn-like burn that

340
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:17,100
can even be third
degree, can be severe.

341
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:21,460
And here's some rare but

342
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:24,020
serious adverse effects.

343
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,640
Hypersensitivity,
anything can

344
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,360
cause hypersensitivity
in the

345
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,880
sensitive
individual. well.

346
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,900
Drug specific.

347
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,060
Metacycline
can cause this

348
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:40,160
ototoxicity in the
vestibular region

349
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:46,820
and it can discolor
the skin with long

350
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:49,100
-term use. And
metacycline is frequently

351
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,900
used to treat acne,
which means long-term

352
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:55,260
use, and therefore
patients can develop

353
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:58,400
these patches, these
discolored patches.

354
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,840
Demeclocycline
we talked about,

355
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,560
tigocycline we
talked about.

356
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,780
Decreased absorption
by taking antacids

357
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:10,260
or mineral
supplements. Also bile

358
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,860
acid resins, which
is not minerals,

359
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:16,260
but it's a resin
that binds things.

360
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:20,860
So that's another way
to prevent absorption.

361
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:24,300
That means separating
these drugs from the

362
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:28,960
antibiotics. We talked
about warfarin and

363
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,260
oral contraceptives and
injury to the gut bacteria

364
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:36,500
that can cause
bleeding in the case of

365
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:40,260
warfarin and reduced
efficacy of oral

366
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:44,340
contraceptives in the case
of oral contraceptives.

367
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:46,940
And then other drugs

368
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,780
with similar toxicities.

369
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:52,260
Let's talk about
macrolides now.

370
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,620
There are three
in this group,

371
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,940
three important
drugs in this

372
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,060
group, erythromycin,
clarithromycin,

373
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:03,840
isythromycin, and
here is a big ring, a

374
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,960
lactone ring that
macrolides are known for.

375
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,640
I'll just hit the
important parts here.

376
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,480
They are widely
distributed. They do

377
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,740
accumulate in pulmonary
tissue, middle

378
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:21,260
air fluid, phagocytic
cells. This should

379
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:23,960
be pointing to the
respiratory system.

380
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:27,600
Erythromycin and
clarithromycin, high

381
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,660
potential for drug
interactions because

382
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:33,200
of CYP3A4 and p
-glycoprotein inhibition.

383
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:37,260
Anazithromycin, not,

384
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:40,140
does inhibit p
-glycoprotein,

385
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:45,300
but not CYP3A4,
so much lower

386
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,820
potential for
drug interactions.

387
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:53,120
Azithromycin has a
70-hour half-life.

388
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,380
Erycerol and chlorhycerol,
much shorter.

389
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:04,760
The azithromycin
will sequester

390
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,670
within the tissues,
which is why

391
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:10,000
it has such a
long half-life.

392
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,800
It can be taken once
a day, and it can be

393
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,780
taken for common
infections for five days

394
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:22,180
and produce a 10-day
course of blood levels.

395
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:31,090
What else?

396
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:35,410
This is what I
want to point out.

397
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:38,110
Erythromycin and
azithromycin, no dose

398
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:40,750
adjustment necessary
for renal impairment.

399
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:45,310
Those are the
high points of the

400
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:47,470
pharmacokinetics
of macrolides.

401
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:52,890
Mechanism. So imagine
in your mind the

402
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:56,590
big ribosome and right
in the middle at the

403
00:23:56,590 --> 00:24:00,430
P site is the macrolide
site of action.

404
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:06,650
P site right here.
So these macrolides

405
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:09,490
have been identified
as working

406
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:14,150
according to this
following description.

407
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,990
They block elongation,
so they block the

408
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:24,770
transpeptidation step
by blocking the exit

409
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:27,370
tunnel. Let's pretend
this is an exit

410
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:31,990
tunnel, protein is being
synthesized, reaches

411
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:34,570
out into the cytoplasm
through this tunnel,

412
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:38,890
and this exit tunnel
gets blocked, and

413
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:44,890
that causes the
peptide bond formation

414
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:49,230
here to stop, and
protein synthesis stops.

415
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:55,850
Well, lots of
intrinsic resistance

416
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:58,650
here to the
macrolides, so

417
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:00,230
let's talk about
the acquired.

418
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:04,250
E-flux with
these MRS genes,

419
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:08,770
MRS, MEF, MEF.
I don't know

420
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:10,830
what those
letters stand for.

421
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:14,330
So, staph,

422
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:17,750
strep, streptococcus
pneumoniae, this

423
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:21,970
group A streptococcus,
strep pyogenes,

424
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:25,130
and ribosomal
modification. I want

425
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:26,470
to talk about
this for a minute.

426
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:32,690
something called the
ERM gene or the group

427
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:37,650
of genes it's a group
will express a protein

428
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:42,250
methylase and that
methylase will transfer

429
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:47,300
a methyl group to
the binding site and

430
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:51,730
therefore the drug will
not be able to bind.

431
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:58,810
This methylase can be
produced in a constitutive

432
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:03,290
fashion where it's
continuously there.

433
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:06,670
The mRNA is
continuously present

434
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:08,750
producing this methylase.

435
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,460
Or it can be inducible,

436
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:19,590
which means it's on
the DNA But there needs

437
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:24,210
to be a product around,
such as erythromycin,

438
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:28,190
that will cause it
to start expressing

439
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:32,210
this methylase. So
constitutive or inducible.

440
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:37,630
That's the
characteristics of the ERM

441
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:43,550
gene. And we see it
expressed by streptococcus

442
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:46,370
pneumoniae,
staphylococcus aureus,

443
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:52,830
strep pyogenes,
and there is cross

444
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:55,630
-resistance among all
the macrolides, but

445
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:59,150
that's not all. There's
cross resistance

446
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:02,850
with clindamycin and
streptogrammet B.

447
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:07,050
Streptogrammet B
is another protein

448
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:10,130
synthesis inhibitor
that I'm not going to

449
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:14,450
go into in this
lecture. It is in the

450
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:16,570
handout if you'd like
to read about it.

451
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:21,150
So, what's it called?

452
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:25,670
MLSB resistance
mechanism.

453
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:29,470
macrolide,
lynchosamide, which is

454
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:32,730
clindamycin, and
streptogrammin B.

455
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:36,930
So once the
methylase is present,

456
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:39,650
the organism
can be resistant

457
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:42,110
to that whole
group of drugs.

458
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:48,170
And clindamycin
and streptogrammin

459
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:50,270
B have the same
binding sites, so

460
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:52,130
that makes sense.
So what are we

461
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:54,190
using them for?
Well, respiratory.

462
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:56,370
Respiratory,
respiratory, respiratory,

463
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:59,310
that's really
the main thing.

464
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:02,750
There are others,
yes, but as you can

465
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:06,550
see, it's effective
against all of

466
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:09,990
these various
respiratory infections.

467
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:12,610
I also would like
you to remember

468
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:15,690
whooping cough caused
by Bartotella pertussis.

469
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:18,070
Pertussis means
coughing, cough.

470
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:23,710
I invite you to
go on the internet

471
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:27,820
and look for a video
that's going to

472
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:30,690
produce that
whooping cough sound

473
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:32,690
for you so you can
actually hear it.

474
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:34,610
It'll help you remember.

475
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:37,570
Whooping cough pertussis.

476
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,310
And ******** transmitted

477
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:41,490
diseases, not
so much anymore.

478
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:45,050
Chlamydia, it's an

479
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:46,550
alternative to
doxycycline.

480
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:52,290
Azithromycin used to
be recommended together

481
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:57,550
with ceftriaxone as
a one-dose deal for

482
00:28:57,550 --> 00:29:01,510
the treatment of
gonorrhea. Not anymore,

483
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:05,210
because gonorrhea has
developed resistance.

484
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:07,770
So azithromycin
is no longer

485
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:11,290
recommended with
ceftriaxone. If

486
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:13,150
there is suspicion
of chlamydia,

487
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:17,290
then doxy.

488
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,270
Toxic can be
given together

489
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:23,450
with the ceftriaxone.

490
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:28,370
Skin-skin structure,
widespread resistance.

491
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:30,870
If it works, it
works great, but

492
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:34,050
susceptibility must
be confirmed first.

493
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:37,070
Peptic ulcer,

494
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:40,390
gastroenteritis,
relapsing fever.

495
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:44,130
big story here
is respiratory

496
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:48,390
infections and
gonorrhea. No more.

497
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:56,020
Abdominal cramps,
nausea, vomiting.

498
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:03,180
Erythromycin is the
most likely to cause

499
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:05,660
it. It acts on
something called motilin

500
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:08,020
receptors, which are
in the upper GI tract,

501
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:12,040
and they cause movement,
motilin motion,

502
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:15,540
motility, and
that can give

503
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,580
that nausea and vomiting.

504
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:20,680
Azithromycin and
chlorithromycin can do it

505
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:24,080
at high doses, but
at the doses they're

506
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,180
usually given in, they're
much more tolerable.

507
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:32,640
Another reason why
these drugs have

508
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,600
taken over instead
of erithromycin.

509
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:40,760
Diarrhea, it can be
just antibiotic and

510
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:43,140
cause diarrhea, or it
could be C. difficile.

511
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,340
So QT interval
prolongation, it can

512
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:50,060
cause the ventricular
arrhythmias that

513
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:53,240
are known as tracide
de pointe, which

514
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:57,620
is a drug-induced
cardiac problem.

515
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:01,120
Many, many, many drugs
can cause QT interval

516
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,200
prolongation.
Putting them together

517
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:08,060
increases the risk.
giving drugs that inhibit

518
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:13,540
the metabolism of QT
interval prolongers

519
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:17,820
can increase the risk
of trisodipant. I know

520
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:20,620
that you understand
these concepts now.

521
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:26,460
Hepatotoxicity is
potential. It's not

522
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:29,960
all that common, but
hepatitis has occurred

523
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:34,680
with azithromycin
and clarithromycin.

524
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,460
Hypersensitivity,
we expect

525
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:39,220
that potential
with all drugs.

526
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:42,610
And azithromycin can
be given in pregnancy.

527
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,800
Clarithromycin, no.

528
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,760
Erythromycin,
estalate, no. But

529
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,160
other types of
erithromycin, yes.

530
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,600
Drug interactions.

531
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,340
So anything that
acts at the same

532
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:02,120
site, so clindamycin
and erithromycin,

533
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,400
you're not going
to give together.

534
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,020
Other drugs at
prolonged QT interval,

535
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:08,060
warfarin, we
saw that because

536
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:11,660
of the damage to
the microbiome.

537
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,820
Pharmacokinetics, the

538
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:16,280
CYP3A4 and P
-glycoprotein.

539
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:19,500
I would like you to
remember statin, the

540
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:22,250
word statin, anything
that ends in statin.

541
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,260
This is, the
boards love this.

542
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:30,260
These are CYP3A4
substrates. they can

543
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:34,040
cause toxicity and
it's called muscle

544
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,080
toxicity so that's why
I want you to remember

545
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:42,320
those now
clindamycin mentioned

546
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:49,060
before same site can
be administered by a

547
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:54,940
lot of different routes
and it has activity

548
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:57,300
against the gram
-positive aerobes,

549
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:01,080
MRSA, community-acquired
MRSA, gram-positive

550
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:04,300
and gram-negative
anaerobes, as long as

551
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,320
they're susceptible and,
of course, resistance

552
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,280
is increasing, and
some parasites, which

553
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,980
I'll get to when we
talk about parasites.

554
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,140
This, as you may
recall from that little

555
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:18,320
mind map in the
beginning, is a narrow

556
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,700
-spectrum drug. So it's
easy just really to

557
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:25,800
remember gram-positive
aerobes and anaerobes

558
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:30,240
gram negative
anaerobes that's it you

559
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:34,660
can do it and virtually
three ideas talk

560
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:37,110
about resistance on
the next slide lung

561
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:42,220
abscess pelvic inflammatory
disease skin skin

562
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:46,940
structure all these
various types of gram

563
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:50,440
positive and anaerobic
type infections

564
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:54,120
that's that's the
takeaway. And abscess,

565
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:57,280
abscess, abscess,
above the waist, long

566
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,960
abscess, although
resistance is increasing.

567
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:03,760
I'm afraid I have to

568
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,120
say that after everyone.

569
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:08,260
Clindamycin has
long been associated

570
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:10,360
with C. difficile,
causing C.

571
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,140
difficile infection.
Of course, it's not

572
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:15,460
the only one. And
it can be severe.

573
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:20,320
Pregnancy, safe. So
now we have a couple of

574
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,960
drugs that we know
are safe in pregnancy.

575
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,320
And then drug
interactions,

576
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,800
basically anything that

577
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,540
hits it at the
same target.

578
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:36,200
But also here's something
interesting that

579
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,600
you won't see with
any of these others.

580
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:42,100
The clindamycin vaginal
cream is in an oily

581
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,700
base, and that oily
base can weaken condoms

582
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:48,200
and the diaphragms,
contraceptive diaphragms.

583
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:53,380
So individuals who
practice contraception

584
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:57,080
using either of these
devices should be

585
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:02,320
cautioned when
they receive a

586
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,220
prescription for
vaginal cream,

587
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:06,140
clindamycin
vaginal cream.

588
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:10,000
Resistance. Okay,
let's talk about this

589
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:16,180
again. We mentioned
that the MLSB ERM

590
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:20,210
genes are either
constitutive or inducible.

591
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:25,580
Now, we worry about
inducible with

592
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:28,320
staphylococci and
streptococcus pneumoniae,

593
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,020
which, as you know,
are serious, hard

594
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:32,260
-to-treat infections,
especially MRSA.

595
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:38,840
So if the IRM
gene is present,

596
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:43,820
the infection may
seem to respond

597
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:45,680
to clindamycin
in the beginning,

598
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:50,100
but there can be
therapy failure because

599
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:55,380
the resistance can
emerge during therapy.

600
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:58,400
Well, the potential
for this can

601
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,160
be tested by
something called AD

602
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,960
test. So let's see
what that is. We

603
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:12,690
have four panels here.

604
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:15,850
I draw your attention to

605
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:17,450
C. Let's begin with C.

606
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:22,930
This is an
erythromycin disc.

607
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:25,750
Here's a clindamycin
disc. They're

608
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,930
impregnated with
the antibiotics.

609
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:34,550
We see a zone of
no growth around

610
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:37,510
both of these
discs, which

611
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:40,850
means the drugs
are effective.

612
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:46,410
Looking at D now, here
are the discs, and

613
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:51,890
the bacteria are growing
around both of them,

614
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:55,410
showing that
the drugs, both

615
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:57,690
the drugs, are resistant.

616
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:01,870
I mean to say the isolate

617
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:04,610
is resistant
to both drugs.

618
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:13,370
On B, the organism
is growing around

619
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:15,970
the erythromycin,
but not the

620
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:19,450
clindamycin. So
clindamycin is effective,

621
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:22,150
but erythromycin
is not. Now, that

622
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:29,950
brings us to panel
A and our D zone.

623
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:35,810
So, I've drawn a line
around the D zone.

624
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:43,650
This means that the
isolate possesses

625
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:49,510
the ERM gene and that
the erythromycin has

626
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:56,650
induced it to start
producing the mRNA

627
00:37:56,650 --> 00:38:01,590
which will make the
protein methylase.

628
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:06,750
we know that because
the organism is starting

629
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:12,950
to grow into the
clindamycin area so the

630
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:16,890
clindamycin area now
looks like a d because

631
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:18,850
of the staphylococcus
i guess it's

632
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:25,070
staphylococcus growing
into the clindamycin

633
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:29,670
zone so this is now
going to be reported

634
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:34,330
as resistance clindamycin
resistance the

635
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:38,430
organism is resistant
to clindamycin the

636
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:42,130
d test the reason
it's being reported as

637
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:45,290
resistant is because
of the possibility

638
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:52,810
of therapeutic failure
as the staphylococcus

639
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:56,410
or streptococcus
or the pneumococcus

640
00:38:56,410 --> 00:39:04,930
start to produce
constitutive methylase,

641
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:10,230
constitutively active
ERM gene methylase.

642
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:13,170
D-test.

643
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:17,600
That brings us now
to chloramphenicol.

644
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:21,630
Chloramphenicol
binds reversibly, all

645
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:24,710
of these in this
lecture are reversible,

646
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:32,070
to the 23S RNA in
the 50S ribosome. I'm

647
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:35,050
sure that sounds familiar
by now, macrolides

648
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:38,590
and clindamycin also.
But chloramphenicol

649
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:41,550
is in a slightly
different spot. So

650
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:44,090
it has a different
mechanism of action.

651
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:47,470
It seems to interfere
with the binding

652
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:51,950
of the tRNA to
the acceptor site.

653
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:53,790
So even though the
clindamycin is in

654
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:57,350
here, it's preventing
the binding of

655
00:39:57,350 --> 00:40:00,930
the tRNA with the
amino acid on it.

656
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:04,090
And that's going to
prevent an interaction

657
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:06,830
between the
peptidyl transferase

658
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:13,750
in the P-site and
the amino acid on the

659
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:16,350
tRNA in the A-site.
And that's going

660
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:19,610
to prevent the peptide
bond formation.

661
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:22,390
So chloramphenicol is
slightly different.

662
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:24,550
Chloramphenicol is highly

663
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:28,170
lipophilic, poorly
soluble in water.

664
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:32,810
It is formulated in
a salt, it's called

665
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:35,930
succinate sodium
salt, so that it can

666
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:40,810
dissolve in the
solution in the IV bag.

667
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:45,790
The pharmacokinetics
of chloramphenicol

668
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:47,850
are very important for

669
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:50,210
optimization of
therapy. That's why I'm

670
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:51,970
going through all
of this for you.

671
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:55,310
It is given only IV
in the United States.

672
00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:57,780
Of course, it's got
great oral absorption,

673
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:02,550
but we don't use it
that way because of

674
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:04,850
the toxicities of
this drug. We barely

675
00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:07,090
use chloramphenicol
for anything anymore.

676
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:12,830
So let's talk about those

677
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:14,210
pharmacokinetics again.

678
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:18,990
Succinate salt is
rapidly converted by

679
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:24,470
esterases in the
plasma to the active
chloramphenicol.

680
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:26,170
The chloramphenicol
is not in the

681
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:29,990
salt. it's got pretty
high protein binding

682
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:35,750
it is widely distributed
with good ***********

683
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:38,930
into the CSF remember
it is lipophilic

684
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:43,670
good *********** into
ocular tissues and it

685
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:46,230
used to be available
in the US and eye drops

686
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:51,610
good *********** into
the prostate fluids

687
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:55,610
and tissues it
undergoes glucuronide

688
00:41:55,610 --> 00:42:01,010
conjugation so it's it's
metabolized in the liver

689
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:07,110
by UDP glucuronyl
transferase and two

690
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:10,530
inactive metabolites and
excreted in the urine

691
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:14,450
so active drug goes
into the urine also.

692
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:20,690
Broad spectrum,

693
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:24,610
bacteriostatic,
pia region

694
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:26,270
also again is resistant.

695
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:33,450
Drug inactivation
by acetylation of

696
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:36,570
the drug, bacterial
acetyltransferase.

697
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:39,490
So the drug itself
is inactivated.

698
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:46,010
it has been used
traditionally to treat

699
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:49,470
rocky mountain
spotted fever with a

700
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:52,070
kethial infection
which i mentioned is

701
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:56,390
deadly if left
untreated in children

702
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:58,890
less than eight years
old and pregnant

703
00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:02,390
people why because
doxycycline and other

704
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:05,750
tetracyclines have
traditionally been

705
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:08,390
contraindicated
in this group.

706
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:10,890
Well now, as I mentioned,

707
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:16,870
the American Academy
of Pediatrics

708
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:22,350
allows, recommends
doxycycline to be

709
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:25,050
used, especially
for Rocky Mountain

710
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:29,450
spotted fever in young
children and pregnant

711
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:31,310
people as well as
everybody else.

712
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:38,940
It's also been used
for meningococcal

713
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:41,840
meningitis remember it
is bacteriostatic but it

714
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:45,540
does produce excellent
CSF levels it's

715
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:48,620
only used when nothing
else will work and it

716
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:51,880
would not be used alone
so adverse effects

717
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:55,350
mitochondrial toxicity
it is lipophilic

718
00:43:55,350 --> 00:43:59,300
it can get into the
mitochondria and it will

719
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:01,840
inhibit mitochondrial
protein synthesis.

720
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:08,600
So it can cause
quite an array of

721
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,920
toxicities, bone
marrow toxicity,

722
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,760
Gray syndrome,
which I'll talk

723
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:15,180
about on the next
slide. This one is

724
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:18,240
called idiopathic
aplastic anemia.

725
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,320
Not sure exactly
the mechanism.

726
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:25,300
It doesn't occur in
very many people,

727
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:27,680
so it's likely
happening to people

728
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,800
who are sensitive for
an unknown reason.

729
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,780
It is irreversible
and deadly.

730
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:36,720
Aplastic anemia means
that the bone marrow

731
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,520
is not producing
any blood cells.

732
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:46,240
Plus your normal run
-of-the-mill, which

733
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:50,220
is also very serious
bone marrow toxicity.

734
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:53,080
The drug can also
cause nausea,

735
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,720
vomiting, diarrhea.
You would expect

736
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,840
these with lots
of antibiotics.

737
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:59,720
Stomatitis, which
is an inflammation

738
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:02,280
in the mucous
membranes of the mouse.

739
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:04,300
Glossitis, which is an

740
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:05,840
inflammation
of the tongue.

741
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:10,000
Optic neuritis, these
are neuropathies,

742
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,040
peripheral neuritis,
headache and confusion.

743
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:16,720
Pregnancy, it is a
recommended alternative

744
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:19,840
for Rocky Mountain
Spotted Fever and Plague.

745
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:22,040
But of course, we know

746
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:24,060
we can use doxycycline.

747
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:29,660
We have to be
cautious about the

748
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:31,480
third trimester
because of this gray

749
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:34,740
syndrome. And we
have a CYP2C9.

750
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,940
Okay, gray syndrome.

751
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:41,960
High risk in pediatric
patients, and we're

752
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:44,560
thinking really of
neonates, especially

753
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:48,700
********* and full
-term newborns, as well

754
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:53,080
as infants that are
a bit older, all who

755
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:56,140
have immature hepatic
and renal functions.

756
00:45:57,010 --> 00:45:58,660
That's the key here, the

757
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:01,700
immaturity of the
functions of these

758
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:05,240
newborns. They
have immature

759
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:10,640
UGT, so they have
reduced ability to

760
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:14,280
metabolize the chloramphenicol,
so there will be

761
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:17,780
more drug in the blood
for a given dose.

762
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:21,980
They have reduced
levels of plasma

763
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:25,420
proteins, so a higher
fraction of free drug.

764
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:33,280
They have immature
kidney function, so

765
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,260
increased plasma
concentrations of the drug.

766
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:39,780
All of these are
pointing to the fact

767
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:42,870
that but there will
be significantly

768
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,520
increased levels in
the blood. So when

769
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:49,420
chloramphalicol is given
to these little tykes,

770
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:54,920
the levels need to be
carefully monitored.

771
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:57,600
The doses need
to be carefully

772
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:01,140
monitored because increased
drug concentration

773
00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:03,120
increases the
risk of these

774
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:05,520
concentration
-dependent toxicities I

775
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:08,360
talked about in
the previous slide.

776
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:13,120
drug accumulation in
the neonate causes these

777
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:17,460
toxic levels gray
syndrome it's now called

778
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:19,500
used to be called
gray baby syndrome but

779
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:24,820
now it's gray syndrome
vomiting flaccid muscles

780
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:29,120
abdominal distension
hypothermia and

781
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:32,620
cyanosis and it's the
cyanosis that causes that

782
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:37,100
gray collar It can
progress to vasomotor

783
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:42,020
collapse, irregular
respirations, and death.

784
00:47:44,190 --> 00:47:46,860
Onset is two to nine
days after starting

785
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:51,760
the therapy, but the
progression is rapid.

786
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:54,960
The drug has to be
removed immediately.

787
00:47:56,660 --> 00:48:00,670
Now, it's now called
gray syndrome because

788
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:03,920
other people, the
newborns, but people,

789
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:08,500
especially the elderly
people, who may have

790
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:12,540
reduced kidney function,
reduced liver function,

791
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:16,520
may also be susceptible
to gray syndrome.

792
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:22,740
That takes us to
the oxazolidinones.

793
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:28,000
Lonezolid is the
prototype of this group,

794
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,920
still the one that's
widely used. This

795
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:34,340
has a different action
than we saw with

796
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:38,270
the other ones. It
binds again to the 23s

797
00:48:38,270 --> 00:48:42,720
RNA at a point that's
near that A site.

798
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:46,500
It's in the 50S
ribosome, but it binds at

799
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:49,600
the site A site near
the 30S, and that will

800
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:53,320
prevent the formation
of that initial complex

801
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:56,820
that initiates protein
synthesis. So the

802
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:59,620
protein synthesis never
gets off the ground.

803
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:07,680
IV and oral, 100%
bioavailability, widely

804
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:10,740
distributed in all
the various tissues

805
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:14,560
including the CSF,
minimal metabolism,

806
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:16,880
inactive metabolites, non

807
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,540
-renal renal excretion,

808
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:20,820
five-hour half-life

809
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:25,740
in adults okay all
this sounds great

810
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:29,030
right you can do an
IV to oral switch

811
00:49:29,030 --> 00:49:32,380
don't it can be exactly
the same dose it's

812
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:34,600
going to get where
it needs to go how

813
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,160
great is that well
let's see what the

814
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:39,660
problems are gram
positive only only

815
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:42,240
only only gram
positive only only only

816
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:48,600
bactericidal against
the streptococci but

817
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,420
it's bacteriostatic
against everything

818
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:53,360
else well that's okay
it can still effective

819
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:58,400
MRSA enterococcus
including VRE

820
00:50:00,010 --> 00:50:07,120
tuberculosis MDR and XDR
extensive drug resistance

821
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,860
as if MDR is not
enough we now have

822
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:15,360
XDR and there's really
very little resistance

823
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:18,000
and no cross
resistance all of these

824
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,960
really favorable
features well the

825
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:25,220
resistance can occur
with point mutations at

826
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:27,520
the binding site you
could predict that.

827
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:34,260
Intrinsic resistance,

828
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:38,720
aerobic gram negative
bacteria and all

829
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:42,120
anaerobic bacteria. So
what's it useful for?

830
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,520
Gram positive,

831
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:48,700
aerobic gram positive
organisms. Strep,

832
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:53,680

bone joint drug
resistant tuberculosis

836
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:08,340
and more well let's
take a look at the

837
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:10,860
adverse effects
thrombocytopenia that

838
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:15,060
usually only occurs
after a longer duration

839
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:18,060
thrombocytopenia is
low platelet count

840
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:23,340
and but sometimes
the lenezolid has to

841
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:26,050
be used for a longer
period for difficult

842
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:30,390
infections oh here it
is again mitochondrial

843
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:33,460
toxicities
peripheral neuropathy

844
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:38,040
optic neuritis lactic
acidosis again with

845
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:40,860
the longer duration
of therapy even longer

846
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:42,630
than we see with the
thrombocytopenia.

847
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:54,000
So how does it work?

848
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,400
Sorry, the
adverse effects.

849
00:51:56,940 --> 00:52:00,260
Linazolid is a weak
monoamine oxidase

850
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:05,040
inhibitor. Monoamine
oxidase is an

851
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:10,260
intracellular enzyme,
highly expressed in

852
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:12,200
many, many tissues,
including the liver

853
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:18,300
and in neurons. And
it is important for

854
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:22,600
inactivating serotonin
and norepinephrine

855
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:26,200
and also dopamine.
We're talking

856
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:28,560
about serotonin and
norepinephrine here.

857
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:33,020
By inhibiting monoamine
oxidase, that will

858
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:35,510
increase the levels
of serotonin and

859
00:52:35,510 --> 00:52:37,680
norepinephrine in the
brain and periphery,

860
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,560
obviously, because
it's not being broken

861
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:44,280
down, and that
increase in serotonin

862
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:46,360
levels is going to
increase the risk of

863
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:49,180
serotonin syndrome
in patients taking

864
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:53,660
serotonergic drugs.
All right, what
are serotonergic

865
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:55,540
drugs? I have a
list of them here.

866
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:01,160
Serotonin reuptake
inhibitors, those are

867
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:05,180
antidepressants,
tricyclic antidepressants,

868
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:12,480
And, therefore, if
we give lonezolid,

869
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:15,660
which is an MAO
inhibitor, that can

870
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:18,420
increase the levels
of all of these drugs,

871
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:22,280
which could lead to
serotonin syndrome.

872
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,720
Serotonin syndrome is

873
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:27,540
often mild and
reversible.

874
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:29,480
Patient is uncomfortable,

875
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:31,820
headache maybe,
some confusions,

876
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:33,680
palpitations.

877
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:36,660
But it can be severe,
it can lead to

878
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:39,400
hyperthermia and
hypertensive crisis.

879
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:45,600
So patients, first of
all, the literature

880
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:48,730
recommends that
linezolid be avoided

881
00:53:48,730 --> 00:53:52,140
in patients who are
taking these drugs,

882
00:53:53,970 --> 00:53:56,180
sometimes zolanezolid
is the only

883
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:57,940
drug that can be
given, so the patient

884
00:53:57,940 --> 00:54:00,600
must be carefully,
carefully monitored.

885
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:04,900
So drug disease
interactions. Uncontrolled

886
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:07,420
hypertension because
norepinephrine

887
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:13,520
increases blood
pressure and heart rate.

888
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:16,620
So uncontrolled
hypertension.

889
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:18,980
Pheochromocytoma,
which is a tumor

890
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:23,840
that increases
norepinephrine levels.

891
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:27,080
Thyrotoxicosis,
it's already causing

892
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:29,080
increased blood
pressure and heart rate.

893
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,540
Then, going down here
to sympathomimetic

894
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:36,500
agents and vasopressive
agents, because they

895
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:40,220
can, they do, this is
their job, increase

896
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:43,520
blood pressure and or
increase heart rate.

897
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:47,740
see how it's all
connected you see the

898
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:50,940
mechanisms there
miperidine is an opioid

899
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:55,660
analgesic and it
also has serotonin

900
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:57,740
increasing
increasing effects

901
00:54:57,740 --> 00:55:01,460
now tyramine
tyramine is found

902
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,800
in certain foods like
aged cheese and wine

903
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:10,880
beer and pickles
and salami and other

904
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:14,960
yummy stuff Well,
tyramine is inactivated

905
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:18,900
by monoamine oxidase,
too, and if that

906
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:21,620
is inhibited, tyramine
levels can increase,

907
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:25,860
displace norepinephrine,
and lead to

908
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:27,820
increased blood
pressure and heart rate.

909
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:35,100
So linezolid has
some serious adverse

910
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:37,960
effects that must be
considered when thinking

911
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:41,680
about choosing
linezolid as a therapy,

912
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:44,740
which requires
monitoring if the

913
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:47,620
patient must get it.
Plus, you need to know

914
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:50,340
linezolid is really,
really expensive.

915
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:53,360
Okay, here are
some questions.

916
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:58,240
I I would suggest you
pause the video, but

917
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,440
I'm not going to go
over these questions.

918
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:03,240
The answers are at the

919
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:06,180
end of this PowerPoint.

920
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:11,580
And I really encourage
you to try and

921
00:56:12,530 --> 00:56:15,180
think of the answers
before you look at

922
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:18,080
the answers. And
by all means, talk

923
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:19,940
to people in your
group. Talk to each

924
00:56:19,940 --> 00:56:21,860
other. You don't have
to do this alone.

925
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:26,860
it's important to
learn together to work

926
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:29,360
together you're not
going to be working

927
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:34,980
in clinical practice
by yourself and I

928
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:38,700
have two pages of them
and a really brief

929
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:42,060
summary it's actually
a synopsis because

930
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:45,820
the summary of all
the individual drugs

931
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:47,840
is really in the
beginning under key

932
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:50,520
points I'm not going
to read this to you.

933
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:57,760
And I put the same
mind map here and

934
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:01,640
I indicated underneath
in the ideal

935
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:05,080
world if bacterial
resistance is absent

936
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:09,080
all of the different
organisms that

937
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:11,640
would be susceptible
to these drugs.

938
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:14,840
Tetracyclines is
a big list as you

939
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:17,160
can see they are
broad spectrum.

940
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:20,200
Chloramphenicol I've
just grouped them

941
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:22,720
according to what they
are aerobic gram positive

942
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:25,360
aerobic gram negative
anaerobic and atypical

943
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:27,140
that just covers
just about everybody

944
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:35,440
macrolides the we see
a lot of respiratory

945
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:38,360
organisms strep and staph
which are pretty much

946
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:43,360
resistant now the
atypicals spirochetes,

947
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:48,560
and this
mycobacterium species.

948
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:51,560
Lynchosamide
narrow spectrum,

949
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:54,660
aerobic gram
-positive, MRSA,

950
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:56,800
and anaerobic bacteria.

951
00:57:57,180 --> 00:57:59,280
Easy to remember.

952
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:02,980
Streptogrammins
I put here.

953
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:05,180
I'm not testing
you on these.

954
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:07,540
It's gram-positive only.

955
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:16,420
and linezolid, which
is gram-positive only.

956
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:21,020
That's it.

957
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,660
And here we have
the answers to the

958
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:29,360
questions. That
concludes this lecture

959
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:31,640
on the protein
synthesis inhibitors.
