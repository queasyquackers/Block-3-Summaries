1
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:05,110
This is part two
of the FOM lecture

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:06,840
on head and
neck embryology.

3
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:09,910
This is going to
be on structures

4
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:11,190
that deviate from the

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:12,870
segmented pharyngeal
structures.

6
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:18,170
We'll start off
with the tongue.

7
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:20,270
So tongue
development traverses

8
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,550
multiple pharyngeal
arches, hence

9
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:25,350
why they have
complex innervations.

10
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,850
So when you look at
the figure up the

11
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:33,810
top row, you see
that pharyngeal

12
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:40,390
arch 1 extends as it
grows and forms the

13
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:42,150
anterior two-thirds
of the tongue.

14
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:46,970
When you look at
arch 2, you see that

15
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:51,650
arch 3 begins to
overgrow over arch

16
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:54,210
2. So arch 2 essentially
disappears, at

17
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,990
least from the
external surface of

18
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:58,490
the tongue, but
still provides taste

19
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:00,670
innervation to the
anterior two-thirds.

20
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,050
And arch 3 and 4
form the mucosa of

21
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:06,970
the posterior one
-third of the tongue.

22
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:12,150
and tongue muscles
that form and are

23
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,090
underlying these
external surfaces in the

24
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,370
mucosa are formed from
the occipital somites

25
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,050
which I mentioned
towards the beginning

26
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:22,150
of this lecture and
that's why cranial

27
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:24,190
nerve 12 provides
the motor innervation

28
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:26,610
which is the caudal
most cranial nerve

29
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,730
and this makes
sense when you think

30
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:33,210
about the complex
sensory innervation

31
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:36,670
to the tongue so So
anterior two-thirds,

32
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:42,110
the somatic sensory
innervation is

33
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:43,850
provided by cranial
nerve 5, which

34
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:45,810
is associated with
pharyngeal arch 1.

35
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,190
And then the
taste for anterior

36
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,810
two-thirds of the
tongue is provided

37
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,270
by cranial nerve
7, or facial.

38
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:58,290
And then pharyngeal
arch 3 provides the

39
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:02,490
mucosal and the taste
innervation for the

40
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,330
posterior one-third of
the tongue. And that's

41
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:07,650
why both the somatic
sensory and the special

42
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:10,610
taste sensory innervation
is provided by the

43
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:12,870
glossopharyngeal nerve
for the posterior

44
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,770
one-third of the tongue.
And then even more

45
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:18,630
posterior to that,
both the taste and the

46
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:21,630
somatic sensory
innervation is provided by

47
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:25,450
the vagus nerve, which
comes from arch four.

48
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:32,470
Next up is thyroid.
thyroid and thyroid

49
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:35,070
originates from the
single outpouching of

50
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:38,830
endoderm shown here on
the ventral side between

51
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:41,850
arches one and two
and this is called

52
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:44,090
the thyroid diverticulum
and diverticulum

53
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:47,330
just means an outpocketing
and this exists

54
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:50,650
if you go back one slide
at the foramen cecum

55
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:54,750
which is between the
area of the tongue

56
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,890
that's formed by arch
one and arch three.

57
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:01,450
Now let's talk about
thyroid development.

58
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:04,110
So the thyroid originates
from the single

59
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:07,030
outpocketing on the
endoderm on the ventral

60
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,750
side between arches
one and two. So if you

61
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,930
go back one slide, you
can see this foramen

62
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:17,750
cecum that exists
between the area of the

63
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,690
tongue formed by arch
one and arch three.

64
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:25,190
and so remember that
diverticulum means

65
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:27,490
outpocketing so this is
just a small outpocketing

66
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:29,490
that will eventually
become the thyroid

67
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:33,170
gland and during
development as the

68
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:36,010
embryo and the tongue
grow the developing

69
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:39,490
thyroid gland descends
down the neck so it

70
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:41,570
starts out as a thyroid
primordium or the

71
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:45,030
diverticulum but it
starts to descend through

72
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,590
the neck passing
through the developing

73
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:50,150
higher bone and laryngeal
cartilages. And as

74
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:53,270
it goes down, it
generates or produces this

75
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:56,470
narrow duct called
a thyroglossal duct.

76
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:00,530
And as it continues
or the thyroid

77
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,410
gland continues
downward, it's

78
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,690
going to create a
longer thyroglossal

79
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:08,390
duct along the
midline anterior

80
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:15,110
side of the neck and
after a while the

81
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:18,190
thyroglossal duct
degenerates and then

82
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,890
what only what
remains is the opening

83
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:25,750
pit of the thyroglossal
duct called the

84
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,170
foramen cecum which
we saw on one of the

85
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:30,970
previous slides and
this figure shows

86
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:35,090
the pathway that the
thyroglossal duct

87
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,470
took towards the
thyroid gland.

88
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:44,050
So clinical correlate
related to the

89
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:47,470
thyroglossal duct is what
happens when this duct

90
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,940
does not close up
or does not get

91
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,340
obliterated. That will
lead to the thyroglossal

92
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:55,510
duct sinus or thyroglossal
duct cyst. And

93
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,070
the difference between
the two is that

94
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:00,270
thyroduct cyst, let's
start with there in the

95
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:03,730
middle of the slide,
is there will be a

96
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:07,910
cavity or cyst that
remains because the

97
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:10,610
thyroglossal duct did
not seal up properly.

98
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:13,850
On the other hand,
thyroglossal duct cyst

99
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:16,790
forms, or excuse me,
thyroglossal duct

100
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:19,850
sinus forms when
there's an opening to

101
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:23,410
an external environment.
And both the cyst

102
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:27,150
and sinus pose a risk
because infection

103
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:30,590
can start and spread
within the cyst.

104
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:34,550
So keep in mind that
thyroglossal duct

105
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,990
cyst forms along
the midline of the

106
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:43,850
neck, not lateral like
the branchial cysts.

107
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:48,670
So make sure that
you pay attention

108
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,950
to the location of
this opening to decide

109
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,410
whether it is due
to the thyroglossal

110
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:57,930
duct cyst or sinus
or branchial cyst.

111
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,450
The third clinical
correlate related to the

112
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:08,410
thyroid gland and the
thyroglossal duct is

113
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:11,190
an ectopic thyroid
gland. And this is fairly

114
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:13,850
common. And the most
common presence or

115
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:17,250
presentation of this is
the pyramidal lobe, which

116
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:20,470
is a little extension
along the midline of

117
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:22,290
the thyroid gland so
the thyroid gland is

118
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:25,230
usually h-shaped but
sometimes you'll see

119
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:28,210
this extension along the
midline pointing upwards

120
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:31,030
and this is called
the pyramidal lobe and

121
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:36,530
this is just the thyroid
gland growing along

122
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:40,030
just the short end portion
of the phyroglossal

123
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:43,170
duct and this is not
this does not pose

124
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:46,610
any risk to someone's
health and you might

125
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:49,950
see it on your cadaver
in the anatomy lab.

126
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:56,530
Another special
developmental process that

127
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:59,830
occurs in the head
is called placodes.

128
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:03,730
And so placodes are
ectodermal discs that

129
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:06,830
form from this thin
ectodermal layer. So when

130
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,970
the ectodermal layer
during development

131
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:12,260
invaginates, so again
forming and in-pocketing

132
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:15,090
and buds off, as you
can see on this lower

133
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:18,170
left-hand corner,
then it forms what's

134
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:20,750
called a placode. And
there are a number of

135
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:24,310
special sensory structures
that are derived

136
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,610
from placodes. So
these include the nasal

137
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,890
placode, which will
form the mucosa of the

138
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:30,990
nasal cavity. So that's
going to be closely

139
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:33,590
associated with the sense
of smell or olfaction.

140
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:36,250
The lens placode,
which forms the lens

141
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:39,350
of the eye, the otic
placode, which forms

142
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:42,650
the vestibule and
cochlea of the inner ear,

143
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:45,670
and it also forms
neurogenic placoids,

144
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:47,630
which forms parts of
the cranial nerves.

145
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:52,070
So as I mentioned,
these placodes tend

146
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:55,130
to be associated
closely with cranial

147
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:57,550
nerves and especially
special sensory nerves.

148
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,470
So nasal placode
is associated with

149
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:01,390
cranial nerve one or
the olfactory nerve.

150
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,270
Lens placode is
closely associated with

151
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:05,910
the optic nerve.
and the otic placode

152
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,830
is closely
associated with the

153
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:11,250
vestibulocochlear nerve
or cranial nerve eight.

154
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,590
Now let's talk about the

155
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:14,850
development of the face.

156
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:19,090
So the facial primordia
or the precursor to

157
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:21,810
the face begins with
three major regions. So

158
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:24,920
you have the frontal
nasal prominence here

159
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:28,630
and you have the
maxillary prominences just

160
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,830
above the stomodium
or the embryonic mouth

161
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:33,890
and then the mandibular
prominences and these

162
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:36,250
three major regions will
differentiate further

163
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:40,170
so at six weeks old
the frontal nasal

164
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:43,730
prominence will divide
into sort of the frontal

165
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:48,670
area and then the
nasal process over here

166
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:52,430
on each side of the
embryonic face so on the

167
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:56,050
lateral side this lateral
nasal process will

168
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:57,910
eventually form the
sides of the nose which

169
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,610
you can kind of follow
along in the seven

170
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:03,710
and eight weak embryos.
And then the medial

171
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:07,110
nasal process will come
together to form the

172
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:11,270
intermaxillary segment
shown here in yellow.

173
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:15,470
And this will form
the nasal septum, the

174
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:18,490
middle part of the upper
lip and the philtrum

175
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:21,410
or the medial cleft,
which you can see

176
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:23,350
here on the lower right
part of the image.

177
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,150
and then the
left and right

178
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:30,090
maxillary prominences
will come meet

179
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:32,110
the intermaxillary
prominences

180
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:34,670
to form the upper
cheek regions and

181
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:37,370
the upper lip shown
here in blue and

182
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:38,670
then the left and
right mandibular

183
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:41,290
prominences will
form the lower jaw

184
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,810
lower lip and the
lower cheek regions

185
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:49,210
so now let's take
the video that we saw

186
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:50,690
at the very beginning
of this lecture

187
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,370
and just go over
what we just learned.

188
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:57,490
So here we have the
frontal nasal prominence,

189
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:59,630
and you have the
nasal process forming

190
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:02,180
here. You have the
maxillary process here,

191
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,050
and then you have the
mandibular process

192
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:07,650
over here. And here
are the lateral and

193
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:11,110
the medial portion of
the nasal processes,

194
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,530
which is going
to meet to form

195
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,190
the intermaxillary
process.

196
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:23,190
And then those will
further develop and

197
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:26,310
differentiate to form
the face of a fetus.

198
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,610
So there's a
clinical correlate

199
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,970
associated with the
formation of the

200
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:35,450
face as well as
the hard palate.

201
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:39,310
So the palate forms
through two stages.

202
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:43,240
So we have the primary
palate, which is

203
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,130
formed from the extension
of the intermaxillary

204
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:48,910
segment. So this was
the yellow portion

205
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:52,030
that we also saw
in two slides ago

206
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:54,730
before we played the
video. And this will

207
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:57,270
form what's called,
again, the primary palate,

208
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:59,030
if you follow it
to the right of the

209
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:02,570
image. The secondary
pallet forms from

210
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:05,590
joining of the pallet
time process coming from

211
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:09,590
the maxillary
prominences in blue here.

212
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:12,230
So in this view,
we're looking

213
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:14,910
at the embryo
bottom up. So

214
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:17,270
we're looking up
at the pallet.

215
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:22,030
And by the end, both
of these pallets will

216
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:25,270
close up, forming a
unified hard pallet.

217
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:28,430
So the clinical
correlate portion comes

218
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:32,510
when there is incomplete
fusion enclosure of

219
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:35,090
the maxilla and your
palate. And this is

220
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:37,330
actually pretty common.
So occurs in about

221
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:40,930
one in 1000 births.
And the cleft lip

222
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:45,290
originates from incomplete
fusion around the

223
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:48,650
lip between the
intermaxillary segment and

224
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:51,630
the palatine process.
and the more severe

225
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:54,610
version is the cleft
palate where you have

226
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:58,370
opening within the
hard palate due to the

227
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:00,550
incomplete fusion of
the path time process

228
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:04,570
on both sides as well
as the primary palate

229
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:06,370
formed from the
intermaxillary segment.

230
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:10,250
So this results in
abnormal facial appearance

231
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:13,450
and defective speech
and nowadays it can

232
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:15,970
be treated in most cases
and involves surgery

233
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:18,010
and any therapies,
for example, speech

234
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:20,850
therapies to improve
associated conditions.

235
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:24,930
So when you have a
cleft palate, it means

236
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:27,250
that the oral and nasal
cavities are connected.

237
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,910
So that definitely
needs to be treated in

238
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:33,830
order to prevent issues
with, for example,

239
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:34,570
feeding.

240
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:40,730
Now let's talk about
skull development.

241
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:42,590
So I'm going to
go through this

242
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,890
briefly, and you do
not need to know the

243
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,750
details as on this
slide for the exam.

244
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:49,930
So you have three
embryonic components

245
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,490
that make up the
skull. So you have the

246
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:54,190
chondrocranium,
which is formed from

247
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,930
endochondral bones, so
bones that start off as

248
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:59,530
cartilage and then
transforms into bone.

249
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:02,590
So these include the
occipital, sphenoid,

250
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,790
ethmoid, and
temporal bones, at

251
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,730
least the petrous
or the hard part

252
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:09,830
where the middle and
inner ear resides.

253
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:12,130
You also have the
desmocranium, which is

254
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:16,270
the membranous bone
to the sides and tops

255
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:18,890
of the brain case,
forms the calvary.

256
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:20,970
And these include
the frontal,

257
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:24,450
occipital, and
the parietal.

258
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:29,310
Although this is shown
in blue, parts of

259
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:31,850
it should be membranous
bone in purple.

260
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:34,090
You also have
viscerocranium, which is

261
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:36,890
derived from pharyngeal
arches via, again,

262
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:39,510
membranous ossification.
So these include

263
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:42,210
the temporal bone, the
squamous part, or the

264
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:45,170
flat part, maxillabone,
zygomatic, and

265
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:47,710
the mandible bone,
shown here in the image.

266
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,690
Brain development,

267
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:54,070
similarly, you
don't need to know

268
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:56,790
anything on this
slide, but just wanted

269
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:59,250
to let you know
that the neural

270
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,570
tube, which you
should have gone over

271
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:03,490
in one of the first
embryo lectures,

272
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:08,330
becomes more differentiated
into the forebrain,

273
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,630
midbrain, and hindbrain,
and these will

274
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,370
further differentiate
into different

275
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:16,490
subdivisions of the
brain. You will cover

276
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:19,670
neuronality in more
detail next semester. But

277
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:22,060
the reason why I went
over the skull and brain

278
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,950
development, even
if it briefly, is to

279
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:26,240
talk about some important
clinical correlates

280
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,070
that is caused by
deviations from this

281
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:31,410
coordinated development
of the brain and skull

282
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:34,270
they have to develop
together but what if

283
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:39,630
it doesn't so one of
the conditions that

284
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:42,130
could occur is called
craniosynostosis and

285
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:44,750
this is deformity of
the skull due to the

286
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,410
********* closure of
the sutures which means

287
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:50,410
that the fontanelle is
closed too early and

288
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:53,270
so the type of defect
and the deformation

289
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:56,950
depends on which suture
closed prematurely.

290
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,690
Microcephaly is having
a smaller brain. It's

291
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:03,790
caused by abnormal
development of the brain

292
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:06,310
rather than anything
to do with suture

293
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:10,250
closure and timing thereof
of the skull. And it

294
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,590
often results in mental
deficiency because

295
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:14,950
it's the brain tissue
that's being affected.

296
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:18,090
And then finally, we
have hydrocephalus,

297
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:20,470
which is caused by
elevated pressure in

298
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:24,410
the brain ventricles
due to excess cerebral

299
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:27,670
spinal fluid buildup.
So this results

300
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:31,370
in larger brains, which
then pushes against

301
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:34,210
the skull during
skull development. So

302
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:36,530
this leads to this
expanded brain case

303
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:40,030
morphology. And this
is pretty common, which

304
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:43,150
occurs in one in
about thousand births.

305
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,210
And finally, in
this part, I'm going

306
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:50,070
to be talking
about pituitary and

307
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:53,190
their amazing
developmental origins.

308
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:55,550
So the pituitary,
also known as

309
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:58,810
hypothesis, is a
master endocrine gland.

310
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:02,130
And this is especially
true for growth and

311
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:04,630
reproduction. And the
anterior and posterior

312
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,770
lobes produce different
sets of hormones,

313
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,590
which you can see here,
but this is not going

314
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:11,870
to be tested, at
least for this lecture

315
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:14,370
content. So don't worry
about this for now.

316
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:17,550
But what's interesting
and what you will

317
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:20,210
get tested on is the
developmental or embryonic

318
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:23,270
origins of anterior
versus the posterior

319
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:25,690
lobe or the pituitary.
And I think it's

320
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:28,870
very neat. So what
happens is that the

321
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:33,110
anterior lobe forms
from the upgrowth of the

322
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:36,130
roof of the mouth,
which you can see here.

323
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:37,710
And this is called
the hypophysiopouch.

324
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:42,010
And then the posterior
lobe comes from

325
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:45,110
above, from the
downgrowth of the floor of

326
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:47,670
the embryonic brain,
the diencephalon.

327
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:52,150
And the brain is
originally from ectoderm.

328
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:54,290
So they're both
ectodermal in their

329
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:56,250
origins, but obviously
they're coming from

330
00:16:56,250 --> 00:17:00,870
totally different
parts or tissues, which

331
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:05,370
is remarkable. And the
anterior and posterior

332
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:07,470
lobes of the the
pituitary, while

333
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:11,010
these pouches kind
of dance together and

334
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:13,450
come together to eventually
form the anterior

335
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,810
and posterior lobes
of the pituitary.
