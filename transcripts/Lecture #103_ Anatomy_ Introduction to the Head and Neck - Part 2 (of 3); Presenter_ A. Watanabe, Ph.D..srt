1
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:05,070
This is part two
of the FOM lecture

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:07,190
on special senses
and organs.

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:09,170
And so these are
senses and organs that

4
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:11,470
exist only in the
head and the neck.

5
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:15,390
We're going to
quickly cover the five

6
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,810
special senses in
the head and neck. So

7
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:19,630
these are senses that
should be familiar to

8
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,130
you. You use them
every day. And these

9
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,450
include the sense of
olfaction or smell,

10
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:25,610
vision,

11
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,710
taste or gustation,

12
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:29,850
hearing, and balance.

13
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,190
And we will not
cover these in a

14
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:34,470
big detail today.
you will have

15
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,970
another lecture that
will cover these

16
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,790
senses in much
greater detail.

17
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:42,110
We'll start off with
salivary glands. So

18
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:44,590
salivary glands
secrete saliva directly

19
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:47,290
into the oral cavity
through ducts. And so

20
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:49,570
you think there's only
one set of salivary

21
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:51,870
glands, but there are
actually three. So

22
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,750
we'll start with
parotid gland, which is

23
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,890
located anterior
to the ears in the

24
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,990
posterior cheek region,
which you can see here.

25
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:02,030
And it secretes a
lot of watery saliva

26
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:05,710
given the parasympathetic
innervation.

27
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:07,170
And then when you have a

28
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,930
sympathetic
innervation firing up,

29
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:11,150
then you have a
small amount of

30
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:12,910
viscous saliva
that gets produced.

31
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:16,730
Next up is submandibular
gland, which

32
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:19,550
is located just
below the inferior

33
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:21,510
margin of the
mandible. And the

34
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,910
secretions travel through
this submandibular

35
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:26,350
duct to get into
the oral cavity.

36
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,090
And finally you
have the sublingual

37
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:31,130
gland which is located
in the floor of

38
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:33,450
the mouth and the
secretions travel

39
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,630
superiorly through
just numerous small

40
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:37,790
ducts instead of
one central duct.

41
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,350
You also have a lacrimal

42
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:44,330
apparatus in the head

43
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:48,570
which is a system
responsible for crying. So

44
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,610
crying starts with
the lacrimal gland

45
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,110
producing tears and going
through the lacrimal

46
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:58,830
ducts, which will place
the tears onto the

47
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:02,010
surface of the eyes,
which then, as you blink,

48
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,170
gets washed
away immediately

49
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,790
into the canaliculi.

50
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:10,390
And those drain into
the lacrimal *** right

51
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:14,410
next to the nasal
cavity, and then drains

52
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:17,490
down through the nasal
lacrimal duct, and then

53
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:19,930
there's an opening
into the nasal cavity.

54
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:23,470
And this is why
when you cry, you

55
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,330
tend to sniffle
because you have the

56
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:28,030
tears going into
the nasal cavity.

57
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,370
And of course,
when this drainage

58
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:32,350
system gets blocked
by injury or

59
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:34,310
infection, then it
can lead to irritated

60
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,750
eyes since you
have accumulation

61
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,830
of tears on the
surface of the eye.

62
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,170
In addition to the
glands in the head, you

63
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:44,090
also have important
glands in the neck.

64
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:46,470
So these include the
thyroid, which is an

65
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:49,910
H-shaped gland that sits
in front or anterior

66
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:52,110
to the trachea. And
the function of the

67
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,150
thyroid is that it
takes up iodine from

68
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:57,090
food to produce growth
hormones. So these

69
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:00,490
include the T3 and T4
hormones. So they're

70
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:04,390
triiodothyronine and
thyroxine hormones.

71
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,310
And the production
is controlled

72
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,270
by the pituitary gland.

73
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:11,210
You also have the
parathyroid glands. You

74
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:14,070
have superior to
inferior sets, and

75
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:16,190
these sit within the
thyroid gland and

76
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:19,850
produces parathyroid
hormone, and it helps to

77
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:22,490
regulate calcium and
phosphorus levels

78
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:25,730
in the body and also
controlled by pteriotary

79
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,870
gland as well as
the hypothalamus.

80
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,530
Lastly, we have the
thymus gland, which

81
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:36,290
is active in
newborns and up until

82
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:38,870
adolescence. It
produces thymusin that

83
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:41,510
produces or promotes
differentiation and

84
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:44,690
maturation in T
lymphocyte precursors that

85
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:47,030
get transported from
the bone marrow.

86
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:51,310
And so you'll notice
in the cadavers in the

87
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,750
anatomy lab that
the thymus will look

88
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,910
probably like a blob of
adipose tissue because

89
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:59,650
they're not active in
mature individuals.

90
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,630
now the clinical
correlate related to these

91
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:08,630
glands specifically
the thyroid gland is

92
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:11,010
goiter so this happens
when there's an

93
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:13,430
*********** of the
thyroid gland and it's

94
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:15,970
presented externally as
a lump on the anterior

95
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:18,790
mid middle aspect
of the neck and this

96
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:21,670
is often due to iodine
deficiency so in

97
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,950
renaissance paintings
you can actually see

98
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:27,210
evidence of goiter in
some of the portraits

99
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:32,330
so this could be due
to hyperthyroidism so

100
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:35,110
obviously when you
have a larger thyroid

101
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:37,090
gland it could lead
to overproduction of

102
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:40,610
thyroid hormones but
this *********** of the

103
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,730
thyroid gland can
also be caused by

104
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:45,130
hypothyroidism because
the underproduction of

105
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:48,250
thyroid hormones will
lead to the swelling of

106
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,410
glands in order to
try to produce more

107
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:54,870
growth hormones and goiter
could cause breathing

108
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,630
and swallowing
difficulties or even

109
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,730
speech loss due to
the compression of the

110
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:02,380
trachea, larynx,
esophagus, and the current

111
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,030
laryngeal nerve, which
allows us to speak.
