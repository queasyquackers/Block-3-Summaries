00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:01,840
Hi!

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:04,000
So welcome to the
third part of the

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,540
autonomic series.
We're now covering

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,460
the head and neck.
If you have any

5
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,480
questions always feel
free to reach out.

6
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,360
My email is on there.

7
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,420
So after this session
you should be able

8
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,190
to compare and contrast
sympathetic and

9
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:19,940
parasympathetic
innervation to the head

10
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:21,920
and neck. You should
be able to list the

11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,680
four parasympathetic
ganglia of the head

12
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,220
and their pre-ganglia
input and output.

13
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:29,480
Understand the
innervation and

14
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,360
function of the
glands on the head.

15
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,400
explain Horner's
syndrome and explain

16
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,060
accommodation
convergence reflex so do

17
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:40,560
a little bit of repeat
you've seen this

18
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,000
before a couple of
times now so we're

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,220
covering the peripheral
nervous system

20
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:47,740
there's also central
nervous system which

21
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,820
is the brain and
spinal cord which

22
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,680
you'll learn more
about in your anatomy

23
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,420
but now we're focusing
on the peripheral

24
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,780
nervous system and we
had somatic innervation

25
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,740
and visceral innervation
so we're focusing

26
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,020
only on the visceral
innervation now it's

27
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:05,100
cardiac muscles muscle
and glands and then

28
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,480
we have sensory and
motor for that remember

29
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,120
that they are the two
different neuron types

30
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,300
so we have those
visceral motor neurons

31
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,980
which is a two-neuron system
with the preganglionic

32
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,400
and postganglionic
neuron and you have

33
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,620
the preganglionic
neuron that starts out

34
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,740
in the central nervous
system so in the brain

35
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,680
or spinal cord and
then synapses outside

36
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,980
of the central nervous
system in certain

37
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:32,840
autonomic ganglia
and then you have a

38
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:37,000
postganglionic or postsynaptic
axon that synapses

39
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,980
on the target organ
itself for the wristful

40
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:44,270
sensory neurons those
are bipolar neurons

41
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,340
so you have a cell body
kind of in the center

42
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,700
that sits outside of
the central nervous

43
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,980
system you have a
signal that's coming in

44
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:54,970
from an organ or from
the body ball and then

45
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:58,070
synapses in the central
nervous system we

46
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,060
might just to contrast
sympathetics and

47
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,740
parasympathetics both are
those two neuron system

48
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,680
those motor systems
the pre-gagnionic cell

49
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,320
bodies for sympathetics
can be found

50
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:13,220
between t1 and l2 versus
the parasympathetics

51
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:16,030
are either in the
brain stem or s3s4

52
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:19,500
postganglionic cell
bodies for sympathetic and

53
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,400
pervertible ganglia or
subdiaphragmatic ganglia

54
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,140
and those for the
parasympathetics are in

55
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:29,880
the walls of the organ
or in my new pelvic

56
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,140
ganglia or in those
four ganglia in the head

57
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,900
and neck which we'll
finally get to today

58
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,940
so what are those
types of structures

59
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,300
with those structures
in the head

60
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,880
that we want to
innovate Also, we

61
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:46,700
have the lacrimal
gland, mucus gland,

62
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,420
salivary gland, we
have sweat glands on

63
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,820
the face, we have
sebaceous glands, like

64
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,200
the tarsal glands,
or myelbium glands.

65
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:57,580
And then there's
smooth muscle

66
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,680
structures, like
blood vessels, we

67
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,700
have very small
muscles in the eye,

68
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,480
superior tarsal,
constrictor pupillae,

69
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,260
dilated pupillae, or
ciliary muscle. so for

70
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,070
those structures we
want to get innervation

71
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:16,100
to the head okay now
talking a little bit

72
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,460
about the functions
of the autonomic

73
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:21,500
nervous system so for
the head and neck it's

74
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,440
often that only one
of them is really

75
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:28,860
having an effect so it's
either the sympathetics

76
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,560
or it's the
parasympathetics so that

77
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,860
you can see this in
lachman gland it's not

78
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,780
quite clear what the
sympathetics are doing

79
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,320
there, they're going
there, but it's not

80
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,460
quite sure what
they're actually doing.

81
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,700
The secretion
is really done

82
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,670
by the parasympathetics.

83
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,480
For sweat glands,
that's only done

84
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,260
by sympathetics.
Parasympathetics

85
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,820
have nothing to
do with that.

86
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:52,120
Superior tarsal muscle
and dilator pupillae,

87
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,980
they're both done
by the sympathetics,

88
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,300
versus constrictor
pupillae and ciliary

89
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:59,220
muscle are done by
the parasympathetics.

90
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,840
now there are a couple
of things that have

91
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,840
this dual innovations
so the salivary glands

92
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,300
for example but their
effect is a little

93
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,560
different so the
sympathetics when they

94
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,760
are active for salivary
glands they actually

95
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,000
secrete like a really
dense saliva so think

96
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,780
of when you're very
nervous and your mouth

97
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:23,500
gets like dry that
dense saliva that's

98
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,020
the sympathetic effect
versus parasympathetics

99
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:29,020
when you're hungry
and you're salivating

100
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:33,020
to put like get food
down right that's

101
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,180
the effect of the
parasympathetics it's much

102
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:38,680
more liquid saliva
and then for blood

103
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,200
vessels it's also a
little different it kind

104
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,240
of depends on where
those blood vessels are

105
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,740
so a sympathetic effect
of facial arteries

106
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,800
is actually dilation
like think of when

107
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,180
someone is blushing like
that's a very that's

108
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:55,200
a sympathetic effect
um that you can see

109
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:02,580
now let's focus on
sympathetics um after

110
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:07,340
this little intro so
here's our overview slide

111
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,880
of the sympathetics
remember pre-ganglionics

112
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,020
like all good
sympathetics start in the

113
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,880
lateral horn and for
the head and neck

114
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,620
specifically we start
between t1 and t2 then we

115
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,520
have the are preganglionic
axons that take

116
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,580
their regular pathway
into the sympathetic

117
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,300
chain through the
ventral root, the spinal

118
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,920
nerve, ventral rami,
right rami, communicants,

119
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,700
and then into the
parative ganglion. And

120
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,180
then they ascent in
the sympathetic chain.

121
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:37,360
And for the head specifically,
they will synapse

122
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,820
in the superior
cervical ganglion. For

123
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,500
the neck, they might
also synapse in the

124
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,800
middle cervical or
inferior cervical ganglion.

125
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,240
And then for the head
specifically, you

126
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,140
have the postganglionics
that pass with

127
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,260
the internal and
external carotid plexus

128
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,360
so what does this
look like um if you're

129
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,880
looking at the anatomy
here you can see this

130
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:59,030
is like kind of a
pathway dissected neck

131
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:02,260
you're looking at the
right side and you

132
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:05,340
can see the sympathetic
chain here so you

133
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,180
have the inferior
cervical ganglion middle

134
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,640
cervical ganglion
and superior cervical

135
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:15,120
ganglion, remember
that those ganglia, a

136
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,800
couple of ganglia fused
of the cervical levels,

137
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,320
like in particular
superior cervical

138
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:26,360
ganglion fused C1 to
C4 parvotibic ganglia.

139
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,600
So most of those
preganglionic sympathetics

140
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,480
will just ascent
all the way up to

141
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,020
the superior cervical
ganglion and synapse

142
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,470
there. That's where
most of the post

143
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,900
-kingleonic sympathetic
cell bodies are.

144
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,000
And you can see the
size is really big.

145
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:50,780
So now this is a
kind of bisected

146
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:53,020
view, and you're
looking at the

147
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,880
medial aspect of
the left side.

148
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:03,420
and you can see in
there the superior

149
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,440
cervical ganglion and
then you can see the

150
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,140
external carotid plexus
so you just have those

151
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,500
post ganglionics passing
with the external

152
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,240
carotid artery to
the places where the

153
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,320
external carotid artery
goes and then you

154
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,820
also have the internal
carotid nerve that

155
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,420
just kind of looks like
the continuation of

156
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:22,840
the sympathetic chain
but really important

157
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,640
sympathetic chain are
preganglionics the

158
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,240
internal carotid nerve
those are postganglionics

159
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,100
right so the
sympathetic chain kind

160
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,240
of stops at the superior
cervical ganglion

161
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,440
and then it just
continues as those

162
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,870
postganglionics in the
internal carotid nerve

163
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:39,520
that forms a little
plexus around the internal

164
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,480
carotid artery and
then it branches into

165
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:48,380
the orbit and part
of the nasal cavity

166
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:53,140
like more specifically
here this is kind of

167
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,420
what the internal
carotid plexus all does

168
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,480
so i'm not going to
go through all of

169
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,340
them but just to
to point out a few

170
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,600
so this is like
vasoconstriction of the

171
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:07,400
ocular arteries we
have the dilator

172
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,940
pupillae and superior
tarsal muscles

173
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,720
and then the
vasodilation of facial

174
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,000
arterials covering
the forehead

175
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,600
For the ones
that are passing

176
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,020
with the depetrosal
nerves, they're

177
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,380
going to the
lacronal gland,

178
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:25,740
and then also
vasoconstriction of blood

179
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,820
vessels in the nasal
cavity, palate, pharynx.

180
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,780
So think of
everything that is

181
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:34,440
kind of passing
with that depetrosal

182
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,480
nerve into the
nasal cavity.

183
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:44,860
so for the external
carotid plexus um you

184
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,640
can think of anywhere
where the external

185
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,720
carotid artery goes
that is where you

186
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,840
get the innervation
tube so like with

187
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,020
the maxillary artery
it's kind of going to

188
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,220
the parietic gland
the lingual artery

189
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,320
it's going to sublingual
and submandibular

190
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,120
gland but branches
of the facial artery

191
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,320
might pass to the
submandibular gland

192
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,760
and then with all
of those branches

193
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:12,540
you know it's going
to arteries well

194
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,560
it's innervating
the arteries that

195
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,000
it's passing with
and it will go

196
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,780
through to facial
sweat glands as well

197
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,920
so that was already
the pattern for the

198
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,260
sympathetics it's actually
um now we're finally

199
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,840
getting to the point
where the sympathetics

200
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,820
are actually not that
complicated anymore

201
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,140
um i feel like where
the parasympathetics

202
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,600
are going to be a little
bit more complicated

203
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,500
But one of the important
clinical considerations

204
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,680
here that you
probably see for your

205
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,860
broad studies as well
is Horner's syndrome.

206
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:47,040
So what is that?
So here is two

207
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,500
images of
Horner's syndrome.

208
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,140
Horner's syndrome
is a blockage of

209
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,460
the sympathetic
pathway to the head.

210
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:58,060
And you can see here,
in this case on Bose,

211
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,840
it's the left side
that is impacted.

212
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,760
and often you hear of
a triad of symptoms

213
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:08,860
but there are other
symptoms that you

214
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,160
can actually see really
well here as well

215
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,000
but the the kind of
big symptoms that

216
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,680
you're looking out for
is a constricted pupil

217
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:20,660
dropping of the
upper eyelid and lack

218
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:23,080
of sweating and so you
can see that little

219
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,180
drop of the eyelid
pretty well here

220
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:28,940
that is lack of the
superior tarsal muscle

221
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,460
that is causing
that wall drop. You

222
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,740
have the constricted
pupil because your

223
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,320
dilator pupillae is
not working anymore.

224
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,220
It's all, you know,
done by sympathetics.

225
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,700
And you have a
lack of sweating.

226
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,200
Remember, sweat
glands are all

227
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,060
done by the
sympathetics. So

228
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,500
you have this
lack of sweating.

229
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:51,440
But what you can also
see very nicely here

230
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,420
is that you lose
vasodilation in the face. So

231
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,320
you cannot blush
anymore so in particular

232
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,320
in the lower image you
can see that really

233
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:03,420
well that one side that
is affected the skin

234
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:06,700
is like not red at all
and often you see that

235
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,340
compensatory effect on
the other side where

236
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:13,140
you see like a lot of
blushing on that side

237
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:16,360
and then sometimes
you also see loss of

238
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:20,160
ocular vasoconstriction
so like your your

239
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,180
vessels and your eye
cannot constrict anymore

240
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,480
they're kind of dilated
and they might look

241
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,640
what's called blood shots
so a little bit more

242
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,320
red i think that's a
little bit better seen

243
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,980
in the upper image
it's slightly more red

244
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,980
so it's not as easy
to see but i think

245
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:39,140
like the the vasodilation
is the kind of

246
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:43,100
blush is pretty easy
to see in those images

247
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,860
now for the horner
syndrome you

248
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:51,040
typically think
of this as the

249
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,560
whole you know
neural pathway

250
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,520
i in the lectures
that we've covered so

251
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,840
far will always have
always just talked

252
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,990
about the preganglionic
and postganglionic

253
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:04,800
axons so the
preganglionic here

254
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,920
that's the red axon
or a red neuron that

255
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,140
is referred to as a
second-order neuron.

256
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,220
And then the
postganglionic coming from

257
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,440
the superior cervical
ganglion and then

258
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,920
passing with the
internal and external

259
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,540
carotid, this is
called the third-order

260
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,240
neuron. So there's
also a neuron that

261
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,480
is in the central
nervous system itself.

262
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,200
So I haven't
covered that. You

263
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,640
will cover that
in neuroanatomy.

264
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,600
But there is a
pathway right from the

265
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,930
brain, actually,
into the spinal cord

266
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:37,740
synapsing on that
prekanglionic axon. So,

267
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,980
in fact, there's
really three neurons

268
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:42,360
involved in that
sympathetic pathway, one

269
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,540
central one and then
two peripheral one.

270
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:54,540
Now, different parts
can be here affected.

271
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,400
So you can have a
first-order neuron

272
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,800
disorder that's like
****** or tumor or spinal

273
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,460
cord trauma. trauma,
so anything that is

274
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,000
actually happening in
the central nervous

275
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,040
system that impacts
that whole pathway.

276
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,400
You can also
have a second

277
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,340
-order neuron disorder.

278
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,580
Often you see this
with tumors in the

279
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,500
lung that are compressing
the sympathetic

280
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,580
chain or compressing
the inferior,

281
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,700
the parvotary ganglion.

282
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:27,900
Those tumors are all
called pancos tumors,

283
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,660
so that's the kind of
tumor that does that.

284
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,740
And then we also
have a third order

285
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,320
neuron disorder.
So that would be a

286
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,800
neuron disorder of
the postganglionic

287
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,800
pathways, like a
lesion to the internal

288
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,580
acquired artery or
external acquired

289
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:47,140
artery or injury
to the skull base.

290
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,120
So you will see
different patterns with

291
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,080
those neuron disorders.
So the first and

292
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,020
second order neuron
disorder, they will look

293
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,140
the same, like
everything is impacted

294
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,740
right so you're impacting
the whole pathway

295
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:05,600
so that means like
both you you see your

296
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,040
whole side of the
face where you can see

297
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,440
the lack of sweating
and the lack of blushing

298
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:16,220
the third order
neuron disorder is the

299
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:18,360
one that's a little
different so there you

300
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,320
either have the internal
credit or external

301
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,160
credit impacted so
half of it would

302
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,460
still be working In
most cases, this is

303
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:29,160
actually internal
carotid, much more common.

304
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:32,140
So in that case, for
the internal carotid,

305
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:36,040
you do see the
impacts on the eye.

306
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,260
So you see that mild
drop of the eyelid.

307
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:41,880
You see the constriction
of the pupil.

308
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,880
You also see then
that you cannot blush

309
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,480
on the forehead and
that you cannot sweat

310
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,520
on the forehead.
But for the rest of

311
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,380
the face, which is
done by the external

312
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:55,840
crowded artery and then
the external crowded

313
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,500
plexus, that is
still functional. So

314
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:03,060
that blushing or
like sweating on that

315
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,020
side of the face would
still be working.

316
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,480
But again, first
order, second order,

317
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,760
neuron disorder,
they would look the

318
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,500
same. You're impacting
both internal

319
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,760
and external
crowded, so you have

320
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,380
the whole half of
the face impacted.

321
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:22,100
Okay, now wrapping
this up into a clinical

322
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,660
scenario, like
something that you

323
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,880
might see on the exam,
right? So here we

324
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,960
have a 25-year-old
male presence to your

325
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:34,540
practice with left
-sided mild pitosis in

326
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,980
a constricted pupil.
You had a CT scan,

327
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:39,180
which shows a tumor
in the superior lobe

328
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,320
of the left lung.
You suspect the tumor

329
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,960
is compressing the
sympathetic chain.

330
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,220
Which other symptoms
would you expect to

331
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,940
see? Okay, so you
already know from this,

332
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:51,020
there's a tumor,
probably a Panko's tumor

333
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:54,180
in the left lung, and
it's compressing the

334
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,360
sympathetic chain.
So you know this is a

335
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:01,100
second-order neural
disorder that will

336
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:04,440
impact the whole
sympathetic pathway to that

337
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:08,060
site. We know it's
left-sided, and I've

338
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,980
already given you
two of the symptoms,

339
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:13,760
which is mild pitosis
because your superior

340
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,070
tassel muscle is
not working and also

341
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:19,100
constricted pupil because
your dilator pupillary

342
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,920
is not working now
the other symptoms

343
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,980
that you will see is
lack of sweating right

344
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:26,460
so losing innervation
to the sweat glands

345
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,760
you'll see that on
the whole half side

346
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:31,480
cannot blush on
the left side

347
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,000
that would also
be correct so

348
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,060
two answers correct
a and b here

349
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,000
You cannot blush
because you are losing

350
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,260
the dilation of
facial arterials.

351
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,640
Bloodshot right
eye, that would be

352
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,340
incorrect. It
would be bloodshot

353
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,480
on the left side
because you're losing

354
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,660
constriction of
ocular vessels.

355
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,820
Redness of the left
face, that is also

356
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,800
incorrect. If you see
redness, that would be

357
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,780
on the right side,
right? So the right side

358
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,640
would be overcompensating.
you would see

359
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,540
redness on the right
side but not on the

360
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,600
left side where you
cannot blush anymore.

361
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,640
Dry mouth you wouldn't
see that either

362
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,420
that is caused by
sympathetic and

363
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,380
right now sympathetics
are not working.

364
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,600
Okay now that we
covered the sympathetic

365
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,320
labs move on to the
parasympathetics

366
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:23,560
and they are a
little bit more

367
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,980
complicated for
the head and neck.

368
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,500
okay so for parasympathetic
innovation big

369
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,540
picture right now um as
we're finally getting

370
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:37,820
to those four ganglia
in the um head

371
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:40,400
that we've mentioned all
through those lectures

372
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,280
this is the ciliary
ganglion tercopalatine

373
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,640
ganglion submandibial
ganglion and otic

374
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,600
ganglion and in the
rest of the lecture i

375
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,460
will go through this
ganglion by ganglion

376
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:54,040
and what is their
preganglionic input, and

377
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,240
how do postganglionic
travels from there.

378
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,500
So just big picture
generally, right,

379
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,640
there are a couple of
cranial nerves that

380
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,740
bring preganglionic
axons to those ganglia.

381
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:07,320
So for the ciliary
ganglion, that's

382
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,220
the oculomotor nerve.
For the pterogopelotide

383
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,060
ganglion, that's
the facial nerve.

384
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,880
For the submantibular
ganglion, that's

385
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,980
the facial nerve.
And for the otic

386
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,980
ganglion, that's the
glossopharyngeal nerve.

387
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:21,380
then they synapse in
those ganglia and then

388
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,920
they pass with branches
of the trigeminal

389
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:27,240
nerve to actually get
to the structures that

390
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,350
they need to go to so
the postganglionics

391
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:33,380
will pass with the
trigeminal nerve this

392
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:36,770
is just a different
way of showing this and

393
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,320
showing like other
branches as well so here

394
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,400
in red is the
parasympathetics so you can

395
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,600
see those preganglionic
axons that are

396
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,960
passing with the
oculomotor, the facial,

397
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:50,840
glossopharyngeal. Then
when you're getting into

398
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:56,400
the rest of the
parasympathetics for

399
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,960
the neck, there's
also the vagus

400
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,780
nerve, but that's
not covered here.

401
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,020
But so they're passing
with those cranial

402
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,960
nerves to the ganglia,
here's here ganglion,

403
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,700
ciliary ganglion,
tergopalatine ganglion,

404
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,380
submittibial ganglion,
and otic ganglion.

405
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,620
And then the post
-ganglionics will pass with

406
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,680
the branches of the
trigeminal nerve to

407
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,680
the structures that
they need to innervate.

408
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,700
You also see here
the sympathetics

409
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,680
in blue. And keep
in mind, when you're

410
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,780
in the head,
the sympathetics

411
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,540
that you see are
all post-ganglionic.

412
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,920
Because all the pre
-ganglionics have all

413
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,610
synapsed in the
superior cervical

414
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:37,120
ganglion. So any
sympathetics that you see

415
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,100
in the head are post
-ganglionic. versus

416
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,140
you can see the
preganglionic and

417
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,760
postganglionic
parasympathetics in the head.

418
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,120
So there are other
neurons that pass through

419
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,080
those ganglia, but the
ganglia exist because

420
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:53,660
those are the locations
of the cell bodies

421
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,940
of the postganglionic
parasympathetics.

422
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,820
So now I'll start
with the first

423
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,600
one, that's the
ciliary ganglion.

424
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,850
So for the ciliary
ganglion, preganglionic

425
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:05,540
cell bodies are
found in the brain.

426
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,660
I've added the nucleus
here as well. you

427
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,860
will cover that in
your anatomy. I will

428
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,180
not ask you about this
from this lecture.

429
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,460
The preganglionic
axon pass

430
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:18,840
with the
oculomotor nerve.

431
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,140
Then the postganglionic
cell bodies are

432
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:24,840
found in the ciliary
ganglion and postganglionic

433
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,780
axons pass with the
short ciliary to the

434
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:30,770
ciliary muscle and
constrictor pupillae.

435
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,500
This is just a visual
of that so you can see

436
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,110
that oculomotor nerve
with the preganglionics.

437
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,780
You can see the
ciliary ganglion and

438
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,830
then the synapse there
on the postganglionics

439
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:47,160
which are the kind of
dotted lines here and

440
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,740
that going to those
little ocular muscles.

441
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,280
You can also see
added here again the

442
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,680
sympathetic postganglionic
pathway to the eye

443
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:04,360
as well and general
sensory back now what

444
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,600
do they do there right
so we said that's

445
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,900
the ciliary muscle
and the constrictor

446
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,920
pupillae and they
are responsible for

447
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,240
constriction and
accommodation what does this

448
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,880
mean so pupillary
constriction is when too

449
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,620
much light is shown
into your eyes and

450
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:22,900
your pupils constrict
that's a consensual

451
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,540
reflex so this means
if you shine light

452
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:29,440
into one eye both
pupils should construct.

453
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:31,900
You also do this
when you're focusing

454
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,460
on objects that are
kind of close by.

455
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,820
Accommodation is
when the lens of

456
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:42,180
the eye assumes a
rounded shape or

457
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:47,160
when the shape of
the lens changes.

458
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:51,160
So you also put
them both together.

459
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,860
Accommodation and
convergence they often

460
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:55,280
happen together and
that is when you're

461
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,960
focusing on something
that's close by it's

462
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,700
like when I'm bringing
up my finger and

463
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:02,100
I'm focusing on it I'm
actually using both

464
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:05,760
the constrictor
pupillae and the ciliary

465
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:10,060
muscle to constrict
the pupil and to

466
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:14,800
change the shape of the
lens so that you can

467
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:18,780
focus on that object
okay let's go through

468
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:21,360
this in a little bit
more detail so this is

469
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,000
what accommodation
looks like so again this

470
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,880
is when the lens changes
its shape so in a

471
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,960
relaxed state when the
ciliary muscle is relaxed

472
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,960
you have the lens
that is kind of very

473
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,500
flat and long and it's
suspended by the suspensory

474
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:43,380
ligaments which attach
onto the ciliary

475
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:46,140
muscle and so when the
ciliary muscles relax

476
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,240
those sense suspensory
ligaments are kind

477
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,680
of taut and they kind
of drag out the the

478
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:56,460
lens to be like longer
then when the ciliary

479
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:59,960
muscle contracts it
actually bulges into the

480
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,420
eye like think of this
as um when you have

481
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:06,420
your biceps brachii and
you're contracting it

482
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,900
and then it like bulges
well not not in my

483
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:11,460
case but like and some
people have like really

484
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:14,260
big biceps brachii
they kind of bulge out

485
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,200
right um but that's
that's basically what

486
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,420
the ciliary muscle
does as well so you

487
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,240
have that ciliary
muscle and you contract

488
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,300
it and it kind of
gets rounder and

489
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,140
that releases that
tension from the

490
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:28,480
suspensory ligaments
so those suspensory

491
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,220
ligaments then are not
as taut they kind of

492
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,380
flop back and the
lens becomes rounder

493
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:38,260
so the lens wants
to be round but it's

494
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,440
kind of getting
stretched by the

495
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,720
suspensory ligaments
when the ciliary muscle

496
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,160
is relaxed when the
ciliary muscle is

497
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,660
contracted that
tension is gone and the

498
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,920
lens jumps back to
its rounded shape

499
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:52,900
and so that will
change the angle

500
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:57,420
of the light rays
into the retina

501
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:01,860
so now when we're
looking at accommodation

502
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:05,460
and convergence together
so here on the left

503
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:08,700
side you can see the
ciliary muscle is

504
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:11,340
relaxed and those suspensory
ligaments are taut

505
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:13,720
and the lens is really
flat and you can

506
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:19,700
also see the pupil is
um like open or dilated

507
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:24,040
now if the accommodation
and convergence

508
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:28,060
reflex is active what
you see is that the

509
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:31,500
ciliary muscle is
contracted so the

510
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,620
suspensory ligaments
are not as taut the lens

511
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:37,120
assumes this rounder
shape and then you

512
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,680
also have the constrictor
pupillae which

513
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,040
will constrict and
then close off and

514
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:48,960
constrict the pupil
now keep in mind right

515
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,460
constriction that
is done by the

516
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:53,560
parasympathetics and that
is to allow less light

517
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,500
in so it's a reaction
to a lot of light

518
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,420
and then you're
constricting the pupil

519
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:02,560
dilation is done by
sympathetics so i think

520
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,760
about like fight and
flight when you want

521
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,740
to have like all the
light into your eyes

522
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:09,140
you want to see as much
as possible or when

523
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:11,760
you see someone who's
very nervous um like

524
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,240
their pupils dilate
um so that is done by

525
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,780
sympathetics so you
can see that big uh

526
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:23,120
pupil here to allow more
light in okay so moving

527
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,700
on to the next
ganglion so we covered

528
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,980
ciliary ganglion now
we're heading into the

529
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:30,240
tergopalatine ganglion
so for that by starting

530
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,420
out with preganglionic
cell bodies in

531
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,840
the brain again i'm
adding the nucleus here

532
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,940
you'll see that in
neuroanatomy but don't

533
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:40,700
have to be worried about
this now then we're

534
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,800
going with the
preganglionic axons with

535
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,860
the facial nerve
passing with the great

536
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:48,340
epitrosal and the nerve
of the terrogate canal

537
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:51,480
then the postganglionic
cell bodies are in

538
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,800
the terropelatine genome
and the postganglionic

539
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,340
axons will pass with
direct branches to

540
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:00,720
the lacronal gland or
to with branches of v2

541
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,940
to the mucous glands
in the nasal cavity

542
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:08,000
pellet sinus pharynx so
here's what this looks

543
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,420
like right you have
your facial nerve coming

544
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:14,540
in it will give up
the greater petrosal

545
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:18,940
nerve here then pass
into the pterygoid canal

546
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:21,380
where it's the nerve
of the pterygoid canal

547
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,860
synapse on the pterygo
palatine ganglion

548
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:28,680
and then we'll pass to
the lacron gland with

549
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:31,140
direct branches or
into the nasal cavity

550
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:37,240
and pellet with branches
of v2 so here's a

551
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,440
little more anatomical
view of this right so

552
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,640
you have your teregopelatine
ganglion here in

553
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,140
the teregopelatine
fossa you have your

554
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:48,100
greater petrosal nerve
teregorete the nerve of

555
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,920
the teregorete canal
coming in as your

556
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:54,060
teregopelatine ganglion,
and then just all the

557
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:56,400
branches of B2 that are
passing through, like

558
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,560
your lesser palatine,
greater palatine, and

559
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,860
all of the branches
in the nasal cavity

560
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:05,100
that are providing
innervation to the mucosa.

561
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:11,100
Okay, next one. So
now we're moving on to

562
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,120
submandibular
ganglion, and we have

563
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,980
preganglionic cell
bodies in the
brain, preganglionic

564
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,680
axons passing with
the facial nerve,

565
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,640
but this time we're
going to take the chorda

566
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:23,000
tympani to the lingual
nerve then we're

567
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,600
going with postgagnionic
cell bodies in

568
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,520
the submandibial ganglion
and synapsing there

569
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:31,940
on those cell bodies
and the postgangionic

570
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:35,000
axons we'll just go
direct branches to

571
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,660
the submandibial gland
or we'll hop onto

572
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:40,300
the lingual nerve again
and then go to the

573
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:44,700
sublingual gland and
there's a more diagrammatic

574
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,280
view of the anatomy
here so So you

575
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,880
see that facial
nerve, we can see the

576
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,760
caudatympani coming up,
we saw that caudatympani

577
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,560
join the lingual nerve
and the infratemporal

578
00:27:55,560 --> 00:28:00,320
fossa, and then going
to the submandibular

579
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,700
ganglion, synapse
there, and then go

580
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,200
to the sublingual and
submandibular gland.

581
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,840
So here's this really
more anatomical

582
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,680
view of the
infratemporal fossa and

583
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,680
all cavities, so
you can see those

584
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:20,840
nice branches of the
lingual nerve and

585
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,320
overall of the
mandibular division

586
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,360
of the trigeminal
nerve you can see

587
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,520
quadratympani joining
the lingual nerve

588
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,860
then the
submandibular ganglion

589
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:32,960
being suspended from
the lingual nerve

590
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,880
and you can see those
direct branches to

591
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,100
the submandibular
gland or again it's

592
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,670
going to hop back on
those post ganglionics

593
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:43,080
onto the lingual nerve
and then go to the

594
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,240
sublingual gland to
innervate it here.

595
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:51,280
Okay last ganglion
is the otic ganglion.

596
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,580
Again we start in
the brain now this

597
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,460
time we're passing with
the glossopharyngeal

598
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:58,540
nerve that turns
into topenic nerve,

599
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:00,700
topenic plexus,
lesser patrols nerve.

600
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,100
We're hitting the otic
ganglion where the

601
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,400
post ganglionic cell
bodies are and then

602
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,540
passing with the
auriculotemporal nerve to

603
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:14,640
the parotid gland a
bit of a diagrammatic

604
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,180
view here but that's
your glossopharyngeal

605
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:19,340
nerve passing through
the jugular foramen

606
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:22,540
kind of scratching
by the ear with the

607
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:26,060
tympanic plexus through
the lesser petrosal nerve

608
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:29,600
where getting to the
otic ganglion synapsing

609
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,520
there then with the
auriculotemporal

610
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,230
nerve that will pass
those branches, those

611
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,400
postganglionic branches
to the parotid gland.

612
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,760
So that's just a
different view of that,

613
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,740
where you can see the
parasympathetic pathway,

614
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,680
preganglionic and
postganglionic,

615
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,540
and also those
postganglionic

616
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:49,420
sympathetics that
will pass with the

617
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,780
external carotid to
the parotid gland.

618
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:56,660
So that's kind of what
you're seeing here.

619
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,880
okay now not what he
mentioned with those

620
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,300
uh four ganglia in the
head but other structures

621
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,940
in the neck that
you want to innovate

622
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:11,000
and um that are
parasympathetic and that's

623
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,440
done by the vagus nerve
so remember the vagus

624
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,440
nerve was that was
the big nerve that was

625
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,340
providing parasympathetics
to the thorax and

626
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:20,330
most of the abdomen
it also provides

627
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:23,560
parasympathetic to the
neck so for that we're

628
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,740
just starting off with
the brain pregame leonics

629
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,760
going with the vagus
nerve you're synapsing

630
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,520
close to the target
organ it's kind of

631
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,540
the same as with the
thorax and abdomen right

632
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,960
you saw the same
pattern with the

633
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,360
parasympathetics there
and then it just goes to

634
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,620
glands and blood vessels
in the pharynx and

635
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,920
mucus glands and blood
vessels in the larynx

636
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,800
so that's pretty simple
pattern right we have

637
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,500
those branches of the
vagus nerve we have

638
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:51,100
the pharyngeal branches
that go to pharyngeal

639
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,580
glands we have the
superior laryngeal nerve

640
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,660
and the recurrent
laryngeal nerve that will

641
00:30:55,660 --> 00:31:00,920
then innervate the
larynx itself superior

642
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,340
laryngeal will provide
parasympathetics above

643
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:06,660
the vocal fold and the
recurrent laryngeal

644
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:09,080
will provide
parasympathetics below the

645
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:15,160
vocal fold so yeah just
that side view of the

646
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,080
larynx you can see
that superior laryngeal

647
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:24,360
nerve branching from
the vagus nerve and then

648
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,500
you see the internal
branch that will pass

649
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,940
into the larynx that's
that parasympathetic

650
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:30,980
innovation and you can
also see that recurrent

651
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:33,240
laryngeal nerve
looping back up again

652
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:36,040
between the trachea and
the esophagus and then

653
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,400
moving into the
larynx as the inferior

654
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:42,040
laryngeal nerve that
provides the motor innovation

655
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,940
to all those muscles
in the larynx, but

656
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:47,000
also parasympathetics
to those mucous glands

657
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:49,600
below the vocal
folds. And it's

658
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,500
also going to
innovate this

659
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,060
thyroid and
parathyroid gland.

660
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,400
So here's that cut-up
section. So you can

661
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,800
see that once it
passes into the larynx,

662
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,600
it's called inferior
laryngeal to match the

663
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,000
superior laryngeal.
So we have like nice

664
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:06,920
convergence here of
those nerves. Remember,

665
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,040
this is all vagus
nerve, like big picture,

666
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:12,320
parasympathetics to
the neck is done by the

667
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:16,740
vagus nerve now this is
a really nice summary

668
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:19,540
of the parasympathetics
so if you like

669
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:23,000
really understand this
diagram like you understand

670
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:25,300
parasympathetics
this is listing all

671
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:28,200
the parasympathetics
that are done by cranial

672
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,640
nerves so everything
to the head and then

673
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:34,260
also everything that
the vagus nerve does so

674
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,640
I think this is a really
nice summary to look

675
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:42,340
into okay now that we've
covered parasympathetic

676
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:44,220
and sympathetic
innovation to the

677
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:47,740
head let's think about some
clinical considerations

678
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:51,940
here so I want to
let's start with

679
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:54,980
damage to ocular motor
nerve here what might

680
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:57,620
be causes for ocular
motor nerve damage to

681
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:02,240
motor nerve palsy
pituitary gland tumor which

682
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,420
the pituitary gland
sits right at the base

683
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:08,740
of the oculomotor nerve
or aneurysms and some

684
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:12,480
of the cerebral arteries
that are passing

685
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,480
very close to the
oculomotor nerve as well.

686
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,980
And some of the
symptoms that you would

687
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:19,120
see, I remember
that the oculomotor

688
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,890
nerve is bringing
the preganglionic

689
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:24,920
parasympathetics to
the eye and they are

690
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:28,200
doing the constrictor
pupillae and also

691
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:32,660
the ciliary muscle
so you would lose the

692
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:35,500
accommodation and
convergence reflex and

693
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:38,520
typically the pupil
will be dilated on their

694
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:42,420
side so there's no
there's only the

695
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,380
sympathetics that would
dilate the pupil but

696
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:47,220
there's no effect of
the parasympathetics

697
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:49,340
anymore that would
constrict the pupil

698
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:52,260
You will also
see, of course,

699
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:57,860
somatic motor loss
to the ocular muscles

700
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:01,420
as well as to the
upper eyelid. So your

701
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:04,400
upper eyelid will drop
on the affected side,

702
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,210
more so even than
with the sympathetic

703
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:09,760
innervation, what
we've seen with Horner

704
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,580
syndromes. And then
you will see impairment

705
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:17,240
of certain eye movements
that you will go

706
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:22,000
over in the ocular
muscle lecture as well.

707
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,020
Now just to show
you something

708
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,700
that's a little bit
out of the ordinary

709
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:31,280
here which is
Frey's syndrome.

710
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:35,440
So this is just nuts
what nerves can do.

711
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:39,320
This is pretty common
syndrome after a

712
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:44,100
parotid gland surgery
or trauma to that

713
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,740
region but commonly
if you have the

714
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:48,660
parotid gland removed,
like some studies

715
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:52,420
say between 30 and
50% of the cases, it

716
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:55,300
happens that you
get Frey's syndrome,

717
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,640
which is also called
gustatory sweating.

718
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:00,100
So in this case,
what is happening is

719
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,690
that the auricular
motor, which is, you

720
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:04,730
know, getting all
those parasympathetics

721
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,660
or carrying all
those post-gagnionic

722
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:10,500
parasympathetics responsible
for innervating the

723
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:13,640
parotid gland will
actually grow back to

724
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:17,720
innervate sweat glands
and vessels so stuff

725
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:20,940
that is actually
taken on by that that

726
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:23,420
should be taken on by
sympathetics are suddenly

727
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:26,840
innervated by the
oricotemporal from

728
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,520
parasympathetics and the
effect of that is that

729
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:33,300
if you like when you're
a parasympathetic

730
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,270
gland when your
parotid gland should be

731
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:39,140
stimulated for you know
you see food or you

732
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:42,100
smell food and you
should have saliva

733
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,760
secretion what instead
happens on that side is

734
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,760
that you're sweating
and it becomes very

735
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,560
red so you can see
that here in the image

736
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,120
you can see that scar
of the product gland

737
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,470
surgery and you can see
the sweating and the

738
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:57,660
redness on that size
and it kind of goes

739
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,820
up all the way to the
temples like all the

740
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:03,080
way the innervation
of your ericotemporal.

741
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:08,780
So this is kind
of a bizarre thing

742
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:11,400
that can happen when
neurons can regrow

743
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,100
but in this case
taking over a

744
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:17,000
completely different
function than it

745
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,240
had before and it
would still work.

746
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,720
Okay let's finish
this off with

747
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,460
another clinical
scenario where we can

748
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,440
bring in all of
this innovation.

749
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:31,740
So this is 35-year
-old female presents to

750
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:33,440
the office with the
following symptoms,

751
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,660
pitosis and constrictor
pupil on the right

752
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,760
side. Which nerve is
most likely damaged?

753
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:39,860
First option is
optic nerve and

754
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:41,500
that would be
incorrect. So what

755
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,780
wouldn't be working
with the optic

756
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:46,920
nerve is, with
regards to the pupil,

757
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,800
is that the pupillary
light reflex wouldn't

758
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,660
work. What does
this mean? So if you

759
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:54,880
shine a light into one
eye and that the optic

760
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,040
nerve is not working
on that side it

761
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,220
cannot really receive
that there's light shown

762
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:01,240
into the eye so it
wouldn't trigger

763
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:04,160
constriction of the
pupil if you then move

764
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,370
over to the other side
that is not affected

765
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,700
it would you would
see you would see the

766
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:12,340
light and it would trigger
constriction of both

767
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:15,000
pupils so construction
of the pupil would

768
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:20,720
work on the side that
is not on both sides

769
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,820
if you shine in the
light that is in the

770
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:27,610
eye that is not
affected for trigeminal

771
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:30,260
nerve injury you would
lose sensory particular

772
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:32,460
for the eye now you
would lose sensory

773
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:35,700
to the cornea so in
this case you wouldn't

774
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,820
blink on that side
because there's nothing

775
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:39,660
that stimulates that
reflex when you're

776
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:43,510
touching the cornea
facial nerve is also

777
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:45,300
incorrect that's not
the symptoms that you

778
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:47,040
would see for the
facial nerve. Remember,

779
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,680
facial nerve, if that
is damaged, what you

780
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,940
would see for the eye
or orbit region is

781
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:55,040
that you wouldn't be
able to blink. So you

782
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,620
would lose orbicularis
ocular, but you also

783
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:59,360
have all those other
symptoms of Bell's

784
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,440
palsy, like dropping
corner of your mouth,

785
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,860
drooling, difficulty
smiling, and so on.

786
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,960
For oculomotor nerve,
that's the one that

787
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,660
we just discussed. So
what you would see there

788
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:14,080
from the parasympathetic
side is that you

789
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:22,240
would lose the constrictor
pupillae and the

790
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,660
ciliary muscle, so
you wouldn't have the

791
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:27,180
accommodation and
convergence reflex anymore.

792
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:30,580
your pupil would be
dilated so not constricted

793
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:32,660
but dilated because
you cannot constrict

794
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:36,520
anymore you would
see pitosis because

795
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:40,560
you're losing innervation
to ocular muscles you

796
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,020
would also see all the
other ocular muscle

797
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:46,940
impacts so like limited
adduction elevation

798
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:49,840
and depression of the
eye so typically your

799
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:54,540
eye assumes this um
out abducted position

800
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:59,900
now what is left here
is internal quadriplexus

801
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,720
so this is horner
syndrome right you

802
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:04,280
might have caught that
pitosis constrictor pupil

803
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:11,440
on that side okay now
wrapping up sympathetics

804
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,700
are really simple
right now pre

805
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:16,720
-ganglionic axons for the
head and neck are from

806
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,380
t1 to t2 lateral horn
they synapse in the

807
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,260
superior cervical ganglion
and then they will

808
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:23,720
pass with the internal
and external carotid

809
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:27,000
plexus parasympathetics
pre-ganglionics are

810
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,460
from four cranial
nerves as ocular motor

811
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:33,240
facial glossopharyngeal
and vagus nerve they

812
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,720
synapse in four ganglia
and then the post

813
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:39,240
-scanionics travel with
the trigeminal nerve.

814
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:42,620
The best references
for this from my

815
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:46,840
perspective are Jack
Stern's core concept.

816
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:50,620
But you can also, if you

817
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:52,680
want to really
dive into it,

818
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,620
Yannick 2006 is
a good reference.

819
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,840
I would always
appreciate your feedback.

820
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:05,060
Positive, negative
please let me know how

821
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,840
you're feeling about
this lecture and

822
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:09,800
what you would like
to see more or less of

823
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:14,900
that thank you and
please always feel free

824
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,780
to reach out if you
have any questions
