00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,930
Paths and functions
of somatic afferents

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:05,010
and efferents of
the head and neck.

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:09,850
Video 3. Cranial nerves
9 through 12. This

4
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:11,870
is the final video
in the series and

5
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:14,010
will cover the remaining
cranial nerves.

6
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,870
As with video 2, I
recommend focusing

7
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:19,450
more on where the nerve
exits the endocranium

8
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:21,630
and skull and what
it innervates.

9
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,310
Cranial nerve 9. The
glossopharyngeal nerve.

10
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:27,810
nerve. This is the
main sensory nerve of

11
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,970
the pharynx, and is
responsible for both the

12
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,050
general and special
sense of taste for the

13
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:34,520
proximal one-third
of the tongue. The

14
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,490
glossopharyngeal nerve is
mostly a sensory nerve,

15
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:40,350
but it does contain a
single motor component

16
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:43,190
along with some autonomics.
This motor component

17
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:45,410
innervates the
stylopharyngeus muscle.

18
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:47,870
Glossopharyngeal leaves
the brain from the

19
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:50,370
medulla, where it exits
the endocranium and

20
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,430
the skull through the
jugular foramen. Just

21
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,050
inferior to the foramen,
the glossopharyngeal

22
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:59,610
nerve forms two
successive swellings, the

23
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:03,210
superior ganglion and
the inferior or petrous

24
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,630
ganglion. This is
where the afferent cell

25
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:07,910
bodies of the
glossopharyngeal nerve live.

26
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,690
Glossopharyngeal then
descends the neck,

27
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:13,230
running parallel to
the stylopharyngeus

28
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,650
muscle, sending branches

29
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,610
out to innervate
it as it goes.

30
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,110
Beyond stylopharyngeus,
the glossopharyngeal

31
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:22,010
nerve dives between
the superior

32
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:24,350
and middle pharyngeal
constrictor muscles,

33
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,350
sending out
multiple branches to

34
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:28,630
the pharyngeal plexus
as it descends.

35
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,310
These branches will
provide somatic sensory

36
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:33,670
information for
the entire pharynx.

37
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,430
Glossopharyngeal will
surface again on the

38
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,730
anterior side of the
pharyngeal constrictors,

39
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:40,930
where it terminates
in the posterior side

40
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:43,290
of the tongue,
innervating the proximal

41
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:46,070
one-third. The
glossopharyngeal nerve rarely

42
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:48,350
suffers damage and does
not really have any

43
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,550
common clinical
presentations associated

44
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:53,570
with it, so we'll move
on. The next nerve on

45
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:55,950
our tour is one that
we are all too familiar

46
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,430
with, cranial nerve
10, the vagus nerve.

47
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:01,970
Vagus comes from
the Latin word for

48
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:04,550
wandering or straying
and is a most apt

49
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,930
name for this cranial
nerve. The vagus

50
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,790
nerve is the only
cranial nerve to

51
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:11,290
extend beyond the head
and neck. The vagus

52
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,630
nerve serves as
the main carrier of

53
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,970
parasympathetic
innervation for the axial

54
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:18,550
region of the body,
sending branches as

55
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,730
far down as the first
two-thirds of the

56
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:23,150
transverse colon and
all of the kidneys.

57
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,370
There are even a
few branches that

58
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:27,010
sneak their way down
to the genitalia.

59
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,850
Vagus should be no
stranger to you at this

60
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,550
point, as we have
seen most of these

61
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:35,030
branches in previous
lectures and labs. For this

62
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,090
video, I'm only
going to focus on the

63
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,490
functions of vagus
within the head and neck.

64
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:42,010
The vagus nerve exits
the brain from the

65
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:44,710
medulla and travels
out the endocranium and

66
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:47,950
skull via the jugular
foramen. Similar to

67
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,810
the glossopharyngeal
nerve, the vagus

68
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:52,890
nerve will also form
two small swellings in

69
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:56,050
the jugular foramen, the
superior and inferior

70
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:59,810
ganglia of vagus. The
superior or jugular

71
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:02,030
ganglion is the
afferent component of

72
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:05,630
vagus, whereas the
inferior or nodos ganglion

73
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,750
handles the autonomic
motor functions.

74
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,530
In the head and neck,
there are just three

75
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:13,130
major branches of
the vagus nerve. The

76
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:15,750
pharyngeal branch,
the superior laryngeal

77
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,310
nerve, and the recurrent
laryngeal nerve.

78
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:20,830
The pharyngeal branch
is the first to

79
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:23,260
come off vagus and joins
with glossopharyngeal

80
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,370
to complete the
pharyngeal plexus.

81
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,650
Glossopharyngeal
provides the sensory

82
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:30,190
innervation, whereas the
pharyngeal branch provides

83
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,450
the motor to the three
pharyngeal constrictor

84
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:35,090
muscles. The
pharyngeal branch also

85
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,650
innervates all of the
muscles of the soft palate

86
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:40,730
except for tensor
velae palatini, which,

87
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:43,630
as we learned in video
2, receives innervation

88
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:46,910
from 5-3. The final
muscle innervated by

89
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:49,240
the pharyngeal branch
is the palatoglossus

90
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,390
muscle of the tongue.
The superior laryngeal

91
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:55,010
nerve is the next to
branch off vagus as it

92
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:58,410
descends the neck. This
nerve travels antero

93
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:01,350
-inferiorly to reach
the superior portion

94
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:04,590
of the larynx. As it
travels, it divides into

95
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:07,450
two smaller branches,
the internal and

96
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:10,990
external laryngeal nerves.
The internal laryngeal

97
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,830
nerve is the larger
of the two terminal

98
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:15,410
nerves. It is a sensory
nerve that provides

99
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:17,250
innervation for the
mucous membranes of the

100
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,290
laryngeal vestibule
and middle cavity,

101
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:22,630
including the vocal folds.
It will also send out

102
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,990
a branch to innervate
a small portion of the

103
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:27,690
tongue. The external
laryngeal nerve is

104
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:30,050
smaller than the internal
and is a strictly

105
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:33,250
motor nerve. It provides
motor innervation to

106
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,690
the inferior laryngeal
constrictor muscle

107
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:39,050
and sends another motor
branch to the cricothyroid

108
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:41,330
muscle of the larynx,
innervating it.

109
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:44,810
Note that cricothyroid
is the only

110
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:47,210
intrinsic laryngeal
muscle to be innervated

111
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:50,190
by the superior
laryngeal nerve. After

112
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,010
sending off the
superior laryngeal

113
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:54,350
nerve, vagus continues
to descend the neck

114
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,310
without sending any
further branches.

115
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,290
Once inside the thorax,
the vagus nerve sends

116
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:02,170
out one final branch
to the neck. This

117
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:05,010
branch loops back up
into the neck from the

118
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:08,190
thorax. It is the
recurrent laryngeal nerve.

119
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:10,390
Remember, the recurrent
laryngeal nerve

120
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:12,330
is asymmetrical
in where it loops

121
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:14,750
back. The left side
goes around the

122
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,610
arch of the aorta
near the ligamentum

123
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:18,990
arteriosum, whereas
the right side wraps

124
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:21,130
around the right
subclavian artery.

125
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:23,810
Both recurrent
laryngeal nerves travel

126
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:26,490
superiorly next to
the trachea in an area

127
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,970
called the
tracheoesophageal groove.

128
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,650
The recurrent
laryngeal nerves will

129
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:33,790
give off small
sensory branches along

130
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:35,690
the way, providing
sensory innervation

131
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:37,670
for the trachea
and esophagus.

132
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:40,730
The recurrent laryngeal
nerve ends when

133
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:43,130
it reaches the larynx.
Here, we change

134
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:46,030
the name to the inferior
laryngeal nerve.

135
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:49,210
The inferior laryngeal
nerve is the major

136
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:51,670
nerve supply for
the larynx. It has a

137
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:53,650
sensory component that
provides sensation

138
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:56,330
to the inferior
glottic cavity, and a

139
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,210
motor component that
handles all of the

140
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:00,650
other intrinsic
muscles of the larynx.

141
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,930
There are two branches
of the internal

142
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,830
laryngeal nerve. The
anterior branch supplies

143
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,850
most of our laryngeal
muscles, and the

144
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:11,210
posterior branch
supplies the remaining.

145
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:14,350
You will not be
asked to specifically

146
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:17,070
identify which branch
innervates which muscle.

147
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:20,070
Just remember that
the inferior laryngeal

148
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,330
nerve is the major
innovation for

149
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:24,870
these intrinsic
laryngeal muscles and

150
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:27,170
that cricothyroid is
the sole exception.

151
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:30,590
There are nine
pairs of laryngeal

152
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,330
muscles that move
the laryngeal

153
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:34,210
cartilages in
different ways.

154
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:37,830
Figure 9.39 from
Moore's offers a nice

155
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,770
summary of how these
muscles work. The

156
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:42,910
two most important
pieces of information

157
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:45,250
to learn at this
stage are that the

158
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,710
posterior cricoarytenoid
muscles are the

159
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:51,110
only muscles that
abduct the vocal folds

160
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,330
and that the cricothyroid
muscle is the

161
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,790
only intrinsic
laryngeal muscle not

162
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,530
innervated by the
inferior laryngeal nerve.

163
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,510
Lunachocorrelate
Damage to the recurrent

164
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:02,830
laryngeal nerve
happens during

165
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,830
surgical accidents
or as a consequence

166
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:07,310
of enlarged thyroid
tumors and aneurysms

167
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,390
of the aorta or
subclavian artery.

168
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:12,370
A lesion of the
recurrent laryngeal nerve

169
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:14,590
results in partial
or total paralysis

170
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:16,870
to most of the
intrinsic muscles of the

171
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,590
larynx. If the damage
is unilateral, the

172
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:21,070
patient will present
with what sounds

173
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:23,490
like a hoarse throat.
If the damage is

174
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:26,130
bilateral, then complete
mutinous results.

175
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,570
Bilateral paralysis
of the laryngeal

176
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:30,490
muscles leads to
difficulty breathing as

177
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:32,770
the vocal folds are
now not able to fully

178
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:35,370
abduct, resulting
in raspy breathing.

179
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,890
The next nerve that
we will look at is

180
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:41,030
cranial nerve 11, the
spinal accessory nerve.

181
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,390
Unlike the rest of the
cranial nerves, the

182
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,750
spinal accessory nerve
starts outside of

183
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:48,710
the skull within the
spine. Hence the name.

184
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,150
It begins as a
collection of rootlets

185
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,990
from the first five
to six cervical

186
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:55,650
segments of the spinal
cord. These rootlets

187
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:57,430
enter the skull
through the foramen

188
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:00,670
magnum. Once inside
the endocranium, the

189
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:02,470
fully formed nerve
will run together

190
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:05,750
with vagus as they both
exit the endocranium

191
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,490
and skull via the
jugular foramen.

192
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:10,590
From here, the spinal
accessory nerve

193
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:13,110
parts ways with vagus
and goes inferiorly,

194
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:15,310
paralleling the
internal carotid artery

195
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:17,370
before splitting
off to innervate the

196
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:19,930
sternocleidomastoid
and trapezius muscles.

197
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:23,230
These two muscles were
once a single, large

198
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,510
back muscle that can
still be seen in fish.

199
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:27,830
The evolution of
necks in land animals

200
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,730
required the head to
move separately from the

201
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:32,090
body, necessitating
the splitting of this

202
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:34,790
large back muscle into
two smaller muscles.

203
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:36,890
The shared innervation
from the spinal

204
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:39,210
accessory nerve is a
hallmark of that origin.

205
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:40,670
Clinical correlate.

206
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:42,590
Damage to the spinal
accessory nerve

207
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,330
is often the result
of an accident,

208
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:45,710
such as whiplash
from an automotive

209
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:47,770
collision or laceration
during surgery.

210
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:50,330
Lesions to the spinal
accessory nerve produce

211
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,430
weakness of the
trapezius, causing the

212
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,830
shoulders to droop
towards the affected side.

213
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:57,470
Spinal accessory lesions
can also occur during

214
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,530
childbirth if the
birthing process is

215
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:02,210
particularly difficult.
This results in

216
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:04,790
torticollis, or an abnormal
twisting of the neck,

217
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:07,170
caused by an entrapped
or shortening of the

218
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:09,930
sternocleidomastoid
muscle fibers. An acquired

219
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:12,410
form of torticollis,
known as spasmodic

220
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:15,090
torticollis, occurs
when a damaged cranial

221
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:17,730
nerve 11 becomes
hyperactive, causing the

222
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:20,190
sternocleidomastoid to
consistently contract.

223
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,750
In all of these
cases, the head will

224
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,690
tilt towards the
affected side

225
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:27,070
while the face
points away from it.

226
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:29,810
The final cranial
nerve in this series

227
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:32,790
is cranial nerve
12, the hypoglossal

228
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:35,370
nerve. This is the
chief motor supply

229
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:37,350
for most of the
muscles of the tongue.

230
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:39,550
Hypoglossal leaves
the brain near the

231
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:42,230
medulla and exits
the endocranium and

232
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:44,470
skull through the
hypoglossal canal.

233
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:47,430
After exiting the
skull, the hypoglossal

234
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:49,510
nerve initially
descends the neck before

235
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:52,290
changing direction
and moving anteriorly,

236
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:54,830
where it passes between
the internal carotid

237
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:57,270
artery and the
internal jugular vein.

238
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:00,210
As hypoglossal does
this, it picks up a

239
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:02,350
few hitchhikers from
the cervical plexus.

240
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,670
These nerve fibers
are conveyed to their

241
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,750
destination in the
superior root of ansa

242
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,190
cervicalis via the
hypoglossal nerve, despite

243
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:11,490
not actually being part
of the nerve itself.

244
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:14,150
Once hypoglossal
reaches the posterior

245
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:16,830
belly of digastric,
these hitchhiking nerve

246
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:20,150
fibers split off and
continue inferiorly

247
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:22,990
towards the
anticervicalis. At this

248
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,690
point, the hypoglossal
nerve changes

249
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,910
direction once more and
runs superiorly into

250
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,710
the base of the
tongue, where it fans

251
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:31,910
out to innervate all
of the tongue muscles,

252
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:34,360
with the exception
of palatoglossus.

253
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:37,650
Our tongue has
intrinsic muscles and

254
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:40,530
extrinsic muscles.
The intrinsic muscles

255
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:42,610
are hard to differentiate
in lab and are

256
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:44,830
deep within the
tongue. The comparisons

257
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:47,230
we care most about
are in regards to the

258
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:50,070
extrinsic muscles.
If the name ends in

259
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:52,990
glossus, it's an
extrinsic tongue muscle,

260
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,610
which means that
it attaches to the

261
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:56,810
tongue from somewhere
else on the body.

262
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:59,390
Genioglossus is the
large fan-shaped

263
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:00,950
muscle of the
tongue. It's the

264
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:02,790
most easily seen,
and it functions to

265
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,770
extend the tongue
from the mouth.

266
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:07,430
Hyoglossus does
the opposite,

267
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:09,550
retracting the tongue
and depressing it.

268
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:12,710
Styloglossus also
retracts the tongue,

269
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:14,330
but it will
elevate it as well.

270
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:17,130
So too will
palatoglossus.

271
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,690
Remember that
palatoglossus is the

272
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:21,550
only extrinsic
tongue muscle that

273
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,870
is not innervated
by hypoglossal.

274
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:26,770
Palatoglossus is
innervated by vagus.

275
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:29,330
The palate and tongue
are areas where

276
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,170
knowing which muscle
is innervated by

277
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:33,150
which nerve can get
a bit confusing.

278
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,930
To alleviate this,
Jack Stern from

279
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:37,710
Stony Brook University
came up with

280
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:39,790
a simple nesting
doll approach

281
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:42,250
that we now refer
to as Stern's Law.

282
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,690
The concept is
simple. If a muscle

283
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:47,950
has tensor in the
name, it is innervated

284
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:50,290
by cranial nerve
5-3, full stop.

285
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:53,450
If the muscle has
palate in the name, it

286
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,670
is innervated by
cranial nerve 10, unless

287
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:58,950
tensor is in the name
2. If the muscle has

288
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:00,990
glossus in the name,
it is innervated by

289
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:04,250
cranial nerve 12, unless
palate is present.

290
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,790
Each new rule
is superseded

291
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,070
by the rule before it.

292
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:10,110
Clinical correlate.

293
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,390
Damage to the hypoglossal
nerve presents

294
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:14,950
as weakness or paralysis
of tongue motions.

295
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:17,030
The geneoglossus
test is the

296
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,510
simplest way of
determining if

297
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:20,030
hypoglossal has
been damaged.

298
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:22,570
Geneoglossus is
a paired muscle,

299
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:24,470
and each side
receives innervation

300
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:26,610
from only one
hypoglossal nerve.

301
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,810
To test for a lesion
of the hypoglossal

302
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,850
nerve, patients are
asked to stick out

303
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,570
their tongue as
straight as they can,

304
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:34,730
activating their
genioglossus muscles.

305
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,700
If the nerve has
been damaged,

306
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,990
weakness or even
paralysis of

307
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:40,690
genioglossus will
cause the tongue to

308
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:42,810
deviate towards
the affected side.

309
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:45,150
We have just
learned about each

310
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,750
cranial nerve
in isolation.

311
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:47,850
However,

312
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:50,210
most head and neck
functions rely on

313
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:52,330
multiple cranial nerves
working in concert

314
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:54,430
with each other to
properly function.

315
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:59,010
let's briefly look at
two examples the gag

316
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:02,630
reflex this is a reflex
arc that keeps the

317
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:04,970
body from accidentally
ingesting an unexpected

318
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:07,670
food item it starts
when an unexpected

319
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,750
object comes into
contact with the back

320
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,550
of the pharynx this
triggers the afferent

321
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:15,070
limb of the gag reflex
which comes from the

322
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:17,610
glossopharyngeal nerve
in the pharyngeal

323
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:21,150
plexus glossopharyngeal
sends its afferent

324
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,470
signal back to a
specific nucleus in the

325
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,410
medulla, and this nucleus
communicates with an

326
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:29,210
adjacent nucleus that
sends a motor signal

327
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:32,210
via the vagus nerve,
triggering reverse

328
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:35,250
peristalsis, resulting
in the forceful expulsion

329
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:38,010
of the unexpected
object, or gagging.

330
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,570
Now, these are
the two big

331
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,390
nerves involved
with this reflex.

332
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:44,870
However, the reflex arc
may also incorporate

333
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:47,170
other nerves, such
as the mandibular

334
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:49,480
division of trigeminal
and hypoglossal,

335
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,750
opening the mouth and
lowering the tongue,

336
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,910
allowing for a
more efficient and

337
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:56,630
exaggerated expulsion
of the offending object.

338
00:13:57,890 --> 00:13:59,930
Sensitivity and
contributions to the gag

339
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:02,510
reflex vary from person
to person, but it

340
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:05,550
does remain consistent
for any one person.

341
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:08,490
The gag reflex may
also just be missing.

342
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:11,410
Around 37% of
individuals do not

343
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:13,910
show an appreciable
gag reflex.

344
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:17,110
So that's one
example of multiple

345
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:18,950
nerves functioning
together.

346
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,850
Let's do one
more. This one

347
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:22,410
is a bit more
complicated.

348
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:26,410
Proper swallowing
or deglutition

349
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:28,510
requires the
precise coordination

350
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:30,850
of multiple
cranial nerves.

351
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:34,010
Deglutition is a
three-stage process.

352
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:36,690
The first stage takes
that food bolus and

353
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:39,350
pushes it to the back
of the mouth. This

354
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:41,010
is practically all
performed by our

355
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:43,670
tongue. The tongue
pushes and moves the food

356
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:46,090
item from the hard
to the soft palate,

357
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:48,030
bringing it to the
back of the throat.

358
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:51,270
This is a hypoglossal
dominant action.

359
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:55,010
The second stage is
the most complex.

360
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:58,150
Here we are taking
that food bolus and

361
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:01,330
dropping it into the
pharynx. To do this,

362
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:03,210
we need to get the
soft palate out of

363
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:05,570
the way. This is
accomplished via the

364
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:08,030
coordinated action
between the vagus nerve

365
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:10,170
and the mandibular
branch of trigeminal

366
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:12,730
via the nerve to
tensor velli palatini.

367
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:15,570
With the soft palate
out of the way, we

368
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:18,230
now have to widen
the pharynx. This is

369
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,850
done by activating
the longitudinal

370
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:22,680
muscles of the pharynx,
stylopharyngeus,

371
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:25,650
salpingopharyngeus,
and palatopharyngeus.

372
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:28,970
This requires activation
of our glossopharyngeal

373
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:32,210
and vagus nerves. As
these muscles lift

374
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:35,070
the larynx superiorly,
the epiglottis is

375
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:38,010
pushed closed over the
glottis, shutting off

376
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:40,050
our airway and preventing
us from choking.

377
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:43,010
The food can now
fall into the throat.

378
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:47,070
Our final stage
of deglutition is

379
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:48,730
the rhythmic
contraction of our

380
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:51,510
pharyngeal constrictors
as they push the

381
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:53,690
food bolus down
into the esophagus.

382
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:56,790
This peristaltic
action is done via

383
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,130
innervation from the
vagus nerve again.

384
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,970
So to summarize,

385
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:05,490
stage 1 is
hypoglossal dominant.

386
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:07,770
Stage 2, that's
the complicated

387
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,930
one. It involves
trigeminal,

388
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:12,350
glossopharyngeal,
and vagus.

389
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:15,830
Stage 3, that's
vagus dominant.

390
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:19,410
All these nerves must
function properly

391
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:21,290
for rhythmic
swallowing to occur.

392
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:23,670
The misfiring of
one or more of these

393
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:25,650
nerves produces
dysphagia, or

394
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:28,030
trouble swallowing,
as we can see here.

395
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,190
And with that,
we come to the

396
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:34,270
end of this video
lecture series.
