00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,240
Hello, my name is
Dr. Sonia Rivera

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,700
-Martinez and I'm
Associate Professor

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,280
of the Department
of Family Medicine.

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,760
I am here to
speak to you today

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,780
about the history
and physical exam

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,000
of the gastrointestinal
system.

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,200
The session objectives
for today's lecture

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,260
is identify and describe
the components of

9
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,850
a history for a common
gastrointestinal

10
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:31,380
complaint. We will
describe the components and

11
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,860
sequence of a physical
exam of the abdomen,

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,060
define and describe
and identify the

13
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:41,560
different types of
bowel sounds, identify

14
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,860
and discuss normal
examination findings,

15
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:47,160
and then list
and describe the

16
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,540
documentation and
history and physical

17
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,060
exam for the
gastrointestinal system.

18
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,340
We have a case
presentation of a 44

19
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,480
-year-old female
with a complaint of

20
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,400
constipation which
has been worsening

21
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,900
over the past three
to four months.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,340
What questions should
you ask this patient?

23
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,600
Any questions
pertaining to

24
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,000
osteopathic principles
and practice?

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,580
During your
history taking,

26
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,660
consider the
patient's discomfort

27
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:22,480
in reporting
certain complaints.

28
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,400
We will look into the

29
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,640
definitions of
constipations.

30
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,800
Physicians consider
constipation to be

31
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,640
fewer than three bowel
movements per week.

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,700
Patients, however,
consider constipation

33
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,820
to be production of
hard stools, a feeling

34
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,340
that they have an
incomplete evacuation,

35
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,980
excessive straining,
a sense of ****

36
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:53,320
****** blockage
during defecation,

37
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,300
and sometimes the
need for manual

38
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:59,140
maneuvers to be
able to ********.

39
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,360
For history taking,

40
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,560
particularly for the HPI,

41
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,510
the items that you
should be considering

42
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,440
in the onset, when
did it start? If it is

43
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:16,680
an older person,
consider cancer. What are

44
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,900
the palliating and
provocation factors?

45
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,780
What have they tried?

46
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,620
Also have them
describe the quality

47
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,020
of their stools
and whether or not

48
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,720
they're having the
sensations that we

49
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,340
talked about,
excessive straining,

50
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:36,700
and which of these
symptoms are the most

51
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,380
distressing to the
patient. This is very

52
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:45,060
important. The severity
of these symptoms,

53
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,300
how frequent they
are, what are the

54
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,700
intervals between
bowel movements,

55
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,120
whether they
experience prolonged

56
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,280
straining or need
digital evacuation,

57
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:01,380
use of laxatives
and how often

58
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,820
do they use them,
the sensation

59
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,060
of incomplete evacuation,

60
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,780
and you'd also want
to know the timing.

61
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,460
Does it occur
intermittently and

62
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:16,240
how many bowel
movements per week?

63
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,400
For associated
symptoms, you would

64
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,180
want to ask at
least fever, nausea,

65
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,120
if there's any
abdominal pain.

66
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:30,040
If it alternates with
diarrhea, then consider

67
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,020
it might be irritable
bowel syndrome.

68
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,680
If they have
paradoxical diarrhea,

69
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,840
particularly in the
elderly, consider

70
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,420
***** impaction,
bloating and cramping,

71
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,620
irritable bowel syndrome,

72
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,080
blood in the stools,
consider colon

73
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,520
cancer, particularly
in the elderly,

74
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:56,060
diverticulosis or even
inflammatory bowel

75
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:59,960
disease which includes
Crohn's disease and

76
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,960
ulcerative colitis,
and any weight loss

77
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,900
over 10 pounds,
particularly if it is not

78
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,720
intentional, colon
cancer. Other items to

79
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,840
consider are pain with
digital ****** exam.

80
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,600
You would think
of possibly an

81
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,200
**** fissure
or hemorrhoids.

82
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,700
Leakage of stool.

83
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:31,080
Perhaps there might
be ***** impaction

84
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,080
or ****** prolapse.
Also look into

85
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,280
medications. Common
ones that cause

86
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,120
constipation are
opioids, calcium

87
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,740
channel blockers,
and iron supplements.

88
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,280
In the past medical
history, look into

89
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:52,380
Parkinsonism,
hypothyroidism, and dementia

90
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:55,750
as common causes
for constipation.

91
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,060
Other causes of
constipation include

92
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:05,620
reduced physical
activity. This is for this

93
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,810
reason that you
would want to counsel

94
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,700
your patients to
increase their physical

95
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,170
activity if they
suffer constipation.

96
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,740
Find out about a
history of being

97
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:21,820
bedridden for more
than two weeks. This is

98
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,280
common in patients
who are hospitalized

99
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,220
but sometimes also
bedridden at home.

100
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:31,300
Look into post
-surgical. Many of

101
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,800
the medications
that are given

102
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,060
for surgery do
cause constipation.

103
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:41,050
Look into the history
of any dietary changes

104
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,490
that the patient may
have had recently,

105
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:47,580
particularly
find out how much

106
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,120
fiber is included
in their diet.

107
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,020
It is also important

108
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,730
to look at dehydration.

109
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,180
A lot of individuals
do not drink

110
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,420
sufficient fluids
and this is also

111
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,670
a common cause
for constipation.

112
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,220
Examine for electrolyte
disturbances,

113
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,780
whether or not
there is *****

114
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:13,640
impaction. This occurs
frequently in the

115
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,800
elderly but not
exclusively, and also

116
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,180
if there is intestinal
obstruction.

117
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,970
We will now pass
on to discuss

118
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:27,960
anatomy and how
it relates to

119
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,920
gastrointestinal
complaints.

120
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,300
For examination purposes,

121
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:40,740
we divide the abdomen
in four quadrants.

122
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,100
This is general but
there's more than one

123
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,540
type of way that
we can discuss and

124
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:51,700
identify the different
places in which abdominal

125
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:54,100
pain or the complaints
might occur.

126
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:58,360
Now in this case we
have four quadrants.

127
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,220
The right upper
quadrant, left upper

128
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,660
quadrant, right lower
quadrant, and left

129
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,740
lower quadrant. As
you can see on the

130
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:09,240
illustration, each of
these quadrants have

131
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,360
different anatomical
structures related

132
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,160
to that particular
anatomical quadrant.

133
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:23,390
Here is a table with
contents for each

134
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:26,420
quadrant. This is
for you to review.

135
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:29,480
There are some that you
will readily identify,

136
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,880
such as the liver
and the gallbladder

137
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,440
in the right upper
quadrant in the left

138
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,880
upper quadrant you
will find spleen and

139
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:44,100
stomach left right lower
quadrant the appendix

140
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:49,480
left lower quadrant
the sigmoid colon etc

141
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:56,940
here is another way of
dividing the abdomen

142
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:00,320
this is now in nine
regions in which

143
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:04,700
you have right and left
hypochondriac region

144
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,900
meaning below the rib,
epigastric region,

145
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:12,960
right and left lumbar
region and umbilical

146
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,560
region, and then you
have the right and

147
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,220
left iliac region and
hypogastric region.

148
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:27,620
Here is another table
with contents for the

149
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:32,000
different regions of
the nine area system.

150
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,940
You can go ahead
and study these so

151
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:39,260
you can get
familiarized with what

152
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:42,250
is inside each one
of these regions.

153
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:47,740
This is a
continuation of the

154
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:52,100
previous table
with contents.

155
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,340
Here is a region that
you should be familiar

156
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:01,660
with. It's the costal
vertebral angle.

157
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:06,160
It defines where you
can access the kidney

158
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,300
for tenderness. The
angle is formed by the

159
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:13,020
lower border of the 12th
rib and the transverse

160
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:16,640
processes of the upper
lumbar vertebrae.

161
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:21,560
This is an important
anatomic location.

162
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,660
There is a specific
testing that

163
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,980
is done in this
area for costal

164
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,780
vertebral angle
tenderness.

165
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:34,160
We will now go
on to discuss

166
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,140
the examination
techniques.

167
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:41,940
For examination of
the abdomen, this

168
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,240
is the order in
which it must occur.

169
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,200
First you inspect,

170
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:49,600
second you
auscultate, then you

171
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,980
perscuss, and lastly
you will palpate.

172
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:57,020
Make sure that you
know this very well. It

173
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:00,200
must occur in this
order because doing

174
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:06,100
palpation or percussion
before you auscultate

175
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:11,110
will alter the way that
the intestinal sounds

176
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:15,260
will be. We'll discuss
that more later.

177
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:20,220
In preparing for
the abdominal exam,

178
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:23,900
your room should
have good light,

179
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,360
it should be
warm, all of your

180
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,420
instruments and your
hands should be warm.

181
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,460
The patient, you
should have them in

182
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:35,940
a position that they
are most relaxed.

183
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:39,560
Put in pillow or
folded sheets under

184
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,280
the heads and the
knees. The knees

185
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,840
slightly bent so it
makes it easier to

186
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:48,840
examine the abdomen
in that manner.

187
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
The abdomen will not
have tense muscles,

188
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,520
have the patient's
arms at his

189
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:00,740
sides or his her
sides. The exposure,

190
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:05,200
place the drapes
appropriately. You want to

191
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,800
be able to see everything
from just below

192
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,260
the ******* to just
above the ***** bone.

193
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:18,080
Have the patient
empty their bladder

194
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:21,780
before the
examination and

195
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:24,980
remember this last
important thing.

196
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,260
If the patient
is coming in with

197
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:31,440
pain you should
examine the

198
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,240
area of pain last.
Remember that.

199
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:39,600
Examine the area of
pain last. That is

200
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,180
to minimize discomfort
to the patient.

201
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:47,960
We will now go on to
do each part of the

202
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:52,340
abdominal exam starting
with inspection.

203
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,860
When you're
inspecting the abdomen

204
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,440
of a patient, the patient

205
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,000
should be lying
supine or face up.

206
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,960
The abdomen should
be completely exposed

207
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:09,380
as mentioned in the
previous slides.

208
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,780
It should reveal all four

209
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:15,640
quadrants. Tell
your patient that

210
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,740
you're inspecting
their abdomen.

211
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,440
You can let them
know that you're

212
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,490
inspecting the
abdomen and then

213
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,960
tell them what
you're looking for.

214
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,640
You always remember
that you want to

215
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:32,440
observe from the right
side of the patient.

216
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,220
You're going to
inspect the abdominal

217
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,360
wall. You're
going to look for

218
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,380
symmetry in any
masses that might be

219
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:43,140
present on the
skin. Look for any

220
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:47,720
scars, striate,
dilated veins, rash,

221
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,180
lesions, discoloration.

222
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:56,080
You or pulsations
that might be present

223
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:00,500
during your observation
when inspecting the

224
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,780
abdominal wall contour
you're going to look

225
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:07,100
for things such as
distension whether or

226
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:10,480
not this distension is
generalized or localized

227
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,320
each one of these
would mean different

228
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:17,220
types of diagnoses
whether or not their

229
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:22,980
abdomen is protuberant
scaphoid or flat all

230
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:26,280
of those would have
clinical significance

231
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:33,120
if there are any
masses present on

232
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,520
the abdominal wall
you want to inspect

233
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:39,640
them from different
angles from

234
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:44,920
left, right, caudid,
cephalod views.

235
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,920
You also want
to distinguish

236
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:52,320
between an abdominal
wall mass or

237
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,880
an intra-abdominal
wall mass.

238
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:01,620
You want to inspect
the abdomen for scars.

239
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:05,060
When scars are present,
you should diagram

240
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:08,780
them or describe them
within the chart. In

241
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:12,420
your description include
the location, the

242
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:16,320
shape, the size
measured in centimeters,

243
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,940
the type whether or
not if it is surgical

244
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:23,620
or an injury, and
the healing stage.

245
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,300
Next you want to
make sure that you

246
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,940
correlate this with
patients history.

247
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:33,520
Oftentimes they do not
remember about surgeries

248
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,360
that occurred when
they were young.

249
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:40,420
I also wanted to take
note that there's

250
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:43,640
many notes that are
listed within the notes

251
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,120
section for each
slide. Make sure you

252
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,060
review those documents
there because more

253
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:52,600
explanation will be
included in those notes.

254
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:58,320
You want to also
inspect the abdomen

255
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,520
for striae. STRI
-A are related

256
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,020
to rupture of
reticular dermis with

257
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:06,660
the rapid stretching
of the skin.

258
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:11,980
This occurs very
commonly in multiple

259
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:15,740
disorders such as
Cushing syndrome,

260
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,820
Erlostandrin syndrome,

261
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,780
and ascites,

262
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:23,080
overuse of
cortisone. It is also

263
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:28,370
present in other
times of the patient

264
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:31,580
when there is
obesity, there's

265
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:34,100
pregnancy, or even
during puberty.

266
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:38,090
These may have
clinical significance

267
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:40,020
when they are related to

268
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:42,500
certain syndromes
as listed here.

269
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,380
You want to inspect
the abdomen for

270
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,820
any dilated veins
that are present.

271
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:56,200
A few veins that are
small and visible,

272
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,480
they're generally
considered normal.

273
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,720
However, abnormal
dilatation can

274
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:05,040
be seen in portal
hypertension,

275
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,200
emaciation,

276
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,340
or in IVC obstruction.

277
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,100
These are
important. Here is a

278
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,880
clear illustration
of something

279
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,340
that is called
kaput medusa.

280
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,980
As with many
other regions of

281
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,040
the body, you want
to inspect the

282
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,920
abdomen for any
skin lesions.

283
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,820
As with these scars,
you need to describe

284
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:35,240
the location, the
size, the color, the

285
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,700
shape, and the pattern
of distribution.

286
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:41,080
These may very well
be correlated with the

287
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,260
patient's current
symptoms, so it's

288
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,780
important that you do
make notation of them.

289
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:51,000
Inspect the abdomen
for discoloration.

290
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:55,220
Here we list two
signs that are related

291
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:59,000
to discoloration.
In the Cullen sign,

292
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,910
you will see
periumbilical ecchymosis.

293
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,900
This usually tells
you that there

294
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:08,320
is hemoperitoneum
or bleeding.

295
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:11,540
In the Grace-Turner sign,

296
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,880
the ecchymosis is
located in the flank

297
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,560
region. This would
indicate retroperitoneal

298
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:22,120
bleed. Both of
these signs are

299
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:25,360
omnias for the patients
so pay very close

300
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,500
attention to the
presence of these.

301
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:31,260
Next you will look for

302
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:34,100
jaundice in the abdomen.

303
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,560
Generally there
is the presence of

304
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,740
jaundice. You would
look into three

305
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,060
different types,
the pre-hepatic,

306
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,400
the hepatic, and
the post-hepatic.

307
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:48,620
In the pre-hepatic,
the blood cells

308
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:51,400
would rupture faster
than the liver can

309
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,820
conjugate bilirubin.
In the hepatic,

310
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,640
the liver's inability
to conjugate or

311
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,940
excrease bilirubin
is the cause of the

312
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:04,100
jaundice. And in the
posthepatic, the flow

313
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,260
of bile into the
intestines is blocked.

314
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:10,720
All three of these
are distinct and

315
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,980
have different lab
values you want to

316
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:20,020
inspect the abdomen
for the umbilicus

317
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:25,160
and observe its
contour the location

318
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:28,500
whether or not it's
inflamed any bulges

319
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,940
that might indicate
the presence of

320
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:34,420
a hernia and also
the location can

321
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:37,860
all can be correlated
to the presence

322
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:41,360
of masses or other
occurrences within

323
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,760
the abdomen.

324
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,760
Look into inspecting
the abdomen

325
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,180
for the
respiratory motion.

326
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,940
Absence of respiratory
motion in all or

327
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:59,830
part of the abdominal
wall suggests peritoneal

328
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:02,840
irritation and this
would also be present

329
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:07,160
in acute abdomen.
Respiratory alterans

330
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:11,480
or paradoxical, in which
you would see either

331
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,420
alternating outward
and inward displacement

332
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:18,320
of the abdomen
during respiration,

333
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:25,000
indicating the diaphragm
muscle is fatigued.

334
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,980
And then you would also
can see paradoxical

335
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:34,600
inward displacement
with inhalation, and

336
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,660
that might indicate
the presence of COPD.

337
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:44,910
Inspect the abdomen
also for pulsations

338
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:48,760
and peristalsis.
You might be able

339
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:53,200
to view an abdominal
aortic aneurysm

340
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,720
that might be visible
as a pulsatile

341
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,700
mass. This would
be in a very thin

342
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:03,120
person or in the
presence of emaciation.

343
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,100
You might also see
visible peristalsis. Here

344
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:11,120
I include a video that
shows it markedly.

345
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:17,080
Next we will discuss
auscultation and

346
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,880
common findings
that you made here

347
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:23,300
during auscultation
of the abdomen.

348
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,420
Auscultation of
the abdomen. This

349
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:31,720
is a reminder to
auscultate the abdomen

350
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:35,820
before percussion
or palpation.

351
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:39,360
These maneuvers may
alter the frequency

352
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,500
of bowel sounds. So
remember, inspect,

353
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:47,500
auscultate before
percussion or palpation.

354
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,160
You want to place
the diaphragm of your

355
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,680
stethoscope very
gently up the abdomen.

356
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,620
This is very important,
particularly if

357
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:59,240
you are examining somebody
that does complain

358
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:03,340
of pain. Listen for
bowel sounds. Note

359
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:06,060
their frequency and
character and you

360
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:09,040
also want to listen
for vascular fluids.

361
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,600
Remember to
auscultate all

362
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,500
four quadrants
of the abdomen.

363
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:22,520
Normal active
bowel sounds. The

364
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:26,280
estimated frequency
is 5 to 34

365
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,800
clicks or gurgles
per minute.

366
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,400
Bowel sounds
are produced by

367
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,940
peristalsis of
the intestines.

368
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:38,400
They occur intermittently.
They're low

369
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,420
-pitched, chuckling.
There are other

370
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:44,720
descriptions of the
sounds that occur with

371
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,760
peristalsis and that
you will end up finding

372
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,620
in your auscultation
of the abdomen.

373
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:59,280
When bile sounds
are hypoactive, this

374
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,280
is referred to as
reduction in the

375
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,400
loudness, tone,
or regularity. Now

376
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,850
remember that within
normal you have

377
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:12,200
the lowest number
is 5 per minute.

378
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:17,040
The sign that intestinal
activity has slowed

379
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:20,560
can be related to
being normal which

380
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:24,560
occurs during sleep
after the use of certain

381
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:28,540
medications such as
opioids and anesthetics

382
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:31,660
and after abdominal
surgery. This is where

383
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:36,180
the abdominal sounds
would be hypoactive.

384
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,780
They may
indicate also the

385
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:41,720
presence of ileus
which is failure

386
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,040
of peristalsis,
peritonitis,

387
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:45,660
bowel obstruction,

388
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,140
constipation,

389
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,580
and electrolyte
imbalances.

390
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:54,620
When the bowel sounds
are hyperactive this

391
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:59,160
is due to increased
intestinal activity.

392
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,440
Sometimes it can't
be heard without a

393
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,120
stethoscope. I'm
pretty sure that all

394
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,140
of you familiar
with those sounds,

395
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:10,260
occurs with diarrhea
and often after eating.

396
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,900
There are disease
states that do

397
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:16,140
have hyperactive
bowel sounds such as

398
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:19,480
Crohn's disease and
ulcerative colitis,

399
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,080
gastrointestinal
bleeding,

400
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,260
enteritis,

401
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,800
early bowel obstruction,

402
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,300
and in laxative use.

403
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:32,520
The absence of bowel
sounds, in order

404
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,000
for you to state
this, you must

405
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,220
listen the abdomen
for a full two to

406
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:41,660
three minutes before
making the statement

407
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,960
that the bowel
sounds are absent.

408
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:49,480
This may occur
after or with ileus,

409
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,540
bowel obstruction,
necrosis of bowel

410
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:56,320
tissue, or peritonitis.
So be careful.

411
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,260
These sound very obneous,

412
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:01,720
all of these disorders.

413
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,580
Make sure you do
listen to the two

414
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,780
two to three minutes
before you make

415
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:11,600
this diagnosis or
document this finding.

416
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,340
There are other bowel
sounds that can't

417
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:19,180
be present in the
abdomen. We have

418
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:22,600
borborygmy, which
are prolonged gurgles

419
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:26,880
of hyperperistalsis.
You can refer these

420
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,300
as the stomach
growling or rumbling.

421
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,580
And then you have
high-pitched tinkling

422
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:37,380
sounds. This is
suggestive of dilated

423
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:40,340
bowel due to the
presence of air and fluid

424
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:43,580
under tension. So
if you hear this,

425
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:46,010
this would be another
one that's omnius.

426
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:49,560
And then you would
hear rushes of high

427
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,800
-pitched sounds that
coincide with abdominal

428
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,600
cramps. This can
be suggestive of

429
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,620
intestinal obstruction.
Remember that all

430
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:01,340
of these must be
correlated with the

431
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:06,160
patient's complaints
and your history

432
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,840
and physical examination
of the patient.

433
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,720
Ascultate the
abdomen for vascular

434
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:17,960
bruies. Bruies resemble
very much heart

435
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:21,620
murmurs. Check the
area of the aorta,

436
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,560
renal, iliac, and
femoral arteries.

437
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:28,100
Presence of these
bruies are suggestive

438
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:31,660
of renal artery
stenosis, which would

439
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:34,260
be a secondary cause
of hypertension,

440
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:37,160
arterial insufficiency,

441
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,360
and arterial occlusion.

442
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:44,440
Ascultate the
abdomen also when

443
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,840
you're listening
for friction rubs.

444
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:50,360
This is rare in
occurrence, may

445
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:53,220
be found over the
liver or spleen.

446
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,500
This implies
that the surface

447
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,540
of the organ
is irregular.

448
00:25:57,550 --> 00:26:00,520
A rub is caused
by the grating of

449
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,960
inflamed peritoneal
surface against

450
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,920
each other during
respiration. There

451
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:09,840
can be involvement
of tumor abscess

452
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,900
or infarction when
this is present.

453
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,680
We will now move on to

454
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,800
discussion of percussion.

455
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:24,440
Percussion of the
abdomen. You want

456
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,660
to make sure
that you percuss

457
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:29,860
all four quadrants
of the abdomen.

458
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:33,360
Assess for tympani
and dullness.

459
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:35,800
Usually you're
going to find

460
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,880
that tympani
predominates.

461
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,520
There may be some
small areas of

462
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,700
dullness, that would
be normal, but note

463
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:48,140
that any large area
of dullness may

464
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:51,400
indicate a mass or
an enlarged organ,

465
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:55,420
such as in a female,
enlarged uterus,

466
00:26:55,940 --> 00:27:00,880
an enlarged liver
in either female or

467
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,840
male, and also an
enlarged spleen. All

468
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,040
of these can be found
with percussion.

469
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:10,040
The liver is one
of the organs

470
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:14,420
that you want to
do percussion and

471
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,260
you're going
to do this from

472
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,080
the mid clavicular line.

473
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,780
You're going to
percuss the liver

474
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:23,660
in a downward or
upward direction.

475
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,360
Start at the area below
the embolicus at the

476
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:32,220
mid-calicular line and
percuss up from the

477
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:36,010
abdominal tympani until
dullness is appreciated

478
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:39,780
around the lower
boulder of the liver.

479
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:42,020
That's what this
would indicate, the

480
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:45,480
lower border of the
liver. Next, you

481
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,960
starting from the
****** percuss a

482
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,920
line from the lung
resonance down towards

483
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,060
the liver dullness.
This would give

484
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:57,460
you the upper
border of the liver.

485
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:00,620
When dealing with the
patient with large

486
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:03,400
breasts, you want
to ask her or him to

487
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:07,260
displace the breast as
necessary. Then you from

488
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:11,520
the area that you
finished percussing from

489
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,920
the upper border to
the lower border,

490
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:17,180
you want to measure
that in centimeters and

491
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:19,560
and that will determine
whether or not the

492
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:23,880
size of the liver is
normal or enlarged.

493
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:29,960
Here we have an
illustration of the normal

494
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,740
liver span from the
midclavicular line.

495
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:37,160
It would be customarily
from 6 to 12

496
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:40,540
centimeters in the right
midclavicular line.

497
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:44,920
The illustration also
points to there is

498
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,100
four to eight
centimeters at the mid

499
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:51,200
-sternal line. We do
not measure the expand

500
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:56,180
of the liver at the
mid-sternal line. The

501
00:28:56,180 --> 00:29:00,440
customary place to
do the liver spine to

502
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:03,660
the thermon, if it's
enlarged or not, is

503
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:06,240
from the mid-clavicular
line. Repeat,

504
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,760
measure from the lip
mid-clamicular line.

505
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:16,280
The next organ that is
customarily percussed

506
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:19,880
is the spleen. The
spleen, when you are

507
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,960
percussing, you're
going to do this from

508
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:26,120
the anterior lateral
aspect of the abdomen,

509
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:29,280
not directly on the
front of the abdomen.

510
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:33,520
Percuss from the
lowest interspace in

511
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,740
the left anterior
axillary line, it should

512
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:40,000
be tympanetic. Ask
the patient to take

513
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,040
a deep breath and
percuss again. It

514
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:48,300
should stay tympanetic
if it is not enlarged.

515
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:52,420
If it becomes dull
upon inspiration,

516
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:56,100
this might suggest
splenic ***********.

517
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,980
These are illustrations
of where the

518
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:06,860
anterior axillary
line would be

519
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,920
located and where
you would do your

520
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:13,480
percussion for the
spleen. It also shows

521
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,580
the difference of
what would occur

522
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:20,060
when the spleen
is not enlarged

523
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:22,900
versus it being
enlarged and

524
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:25,520
which you would
be able to percuss

525
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:30,600
during inspiration,
if it is enlarged.

526
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:35,380
If you detect
any abdominal

527
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:37,660
masses by percussion,

528
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:42,640
these are some of
the items that would

529
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,160
be considered
depending on the area

530
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:48,560
that the abdominal
mass might be located.

531
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:52,060
Remember that this
is that when you

532
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,840
percuss, you would
find a large area

533
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:58,120
of dullness. In the
right upper quadrant,

534
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:01,660
you might consider
a large liver,

535
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:05,660
high drops of the
gallbladder, or carcinoma

536
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:08,420
of the head of the
pancreas, again

537
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:11,580
depending on where
the mass would be

538
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:15,100
located. If it is
epigastric, consider

539
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:18,780
pseudocyst or carcinoma
of the pancreas,

540
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:22,220
or gastric malignancies
or even colon

541
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:26,400
malignancies in
the flank there might
be the presence

542
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:30,120
of a cyst or a tumor
if you look at the

543
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:33,600
left upper quadrant
there might be in the

544
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,140
large spleen or carcinoma
of the stomach or

545
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:41,320
colon if there is a low
right lower quadrant

546
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:45,000
you might think of
appendiceal abscess a

547
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,300
secal carcinoma, ovarian
tumor. On the left

548
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:52,800
lower quadrant consider
diverticular abscess.

549
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:57,300
This occurs commonly
in diverticulitis that

550
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,800
there might be a
presence of an abscess.

551
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:05,300
In a sigmoid colon you
might have a sigmoid

552
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:08,500
carcinoma around in
that area or an ovarian

553
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:12,180
tumor. If it is
central, consider an

554
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:17,220
aortic aneurysm and
suprapugic if the bladder

555
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:21,640
is extended or there
is a uterine fibroid.

556
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:26,940
We will now be
looking into palpation

557
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:29,880
of the abdomen, how
it is conducted,

558
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:33,840
and any findings
that might present.

559
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:38,160
When palpating
the abdomen,

560
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,760
you want to first
do it lightly.

561
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:44,040
This is to identify
any areas of

562
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,660
tenderness,
muscular resistance,

563
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:49,840
and superficial
organs or masses.

564
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:54,960
This should be done
on all four quadrants.

565
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:58,660
Then you will proceed
to do palpation

566
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:01,740
that is deeply. Please
make sure that you

567
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:05,040
use the finger pads,
not the fingertips.

568
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:09,380
You want to attempt
to delineate with

569
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:13,600
this deep palpation
any masses if

570
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,540
there is such as a
pregnant uterus, an

571
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:20,260
abdominal aortic
aneurysm, or a

572
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:23,080
distended bladder.
These would be common.

573
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:27,920
If a patient
complaint is abdominal

574
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,800
pain this is a
reminder yet again make

575
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:34,860
sure you examine the
painful area last.

576
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:40,740
There are several
methods by

577
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:42,860
which you can
palpate the liver.

578
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:46,880
Here we show
bimanual compression

579
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:50,140
and here you would
place your left hand

580
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:54,660
under the right posterior
ribs and then the

581
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:59,820
right hand would
palpate deeply and for

582
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:05,360
the liver below the
ribs on the right side.

583
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:11,160
You can also palpate
the liver by a two

584
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:15,650
-handed deep palpation.
In this method you

585
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:20,100
place your hands
below both hands below

586
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:25,000
the rib cage and then
push upward towards

587
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,260
the head or cephalod
with both hands.

588
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,300
You can palpate
the liver also

589
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,860
by using the
hooking technique.

590
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:40,520
This one is you
take both hands and

591
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:44,340
place them from above
the patient to the

592
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:48,840
lower edge of the
of the rib or from

593
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:52,320
where you actually
palpated or percussed

594
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,680
previously the liver
at that area and

595
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:58,920
then hook the liver
in that fashion.

596
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:06,460
In the palpation of
the spleen while you're

597
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:09,760
standing on the right
side you brace the

598
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,300
posterior ribs with
your left hand and

599
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:16,740
then palpate the
spleen with your right

600
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:20,320
hand. You will ask the
patient to take a deep

601
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,350
breath as the spleen
is being palpated.

602
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:29,000
If the spleen is
enlarged you will

603
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,560
feel the tip of
the spleen when the

604
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:36,520
patient with the
patient's inhalation.

605
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:44,040
Palpation of the kidney.
This is a bimanual

606
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,320
technique, meaning that
you're going to use

607
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,560
both hands.

608
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:51,000
You place one hand
on the patient's

609
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,100
back parallel
to the 12th rib.

610
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:58,260
Then you lift the
patient's back and then

611
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:01,600
place your other hand
below the costal margin,

612
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:05,600
lateral and parallel to
the ****** abdominis.

613
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,660
Ask the patient to
take a deep breath.

614
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:13,900
At the peak of inspiration,
attempt to capture

615
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:17,240
the patient's kidney
between your hands.

616
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:21,440
Remember in this
one is you're going

617
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,080
to stand on the same
side of the kidney

618
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:27,560
being palpated.
So you can do the

619
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,280
right side first and
then the left side.

620
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:38,300
To palpate for
aortic pulsations,

621
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:42,420
you want to press
firmly in the

622
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:45,480
upper abdomen slightly
to the left of

623
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,540
the midline and
then you can from

624
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,860
there identify
aortic pulsations.

625
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:54,480
In persons over 50,

626
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:58,180
you want to try to
assess the width of the

627
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:02,240
aorta by pressing deeply
in the upper abdomen

628
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:06,180
with one hand on each
side of the aorta.

629
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:10,320
In this age group,
the normal aorta

630
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,160
is not more than
three centimeters

631
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:16,740
wide. This measurement
does not include

632
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:19,380
the thickness of
the abdominal wall.

633
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:23,680
The ease with which
you feel the aortic

634
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:27,820
pulsation greatly varies
with the thickness

635
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:30,840
of the abdominal
wall and with the

636
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:34,840
anterior posterior
diameter of the abdomen.

637
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:39,820
In an older person,
a peri-umbilical or

638
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:44,660
upper abdominal mass
with pulsations may

639
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:48,640
indicate the presence
of an aortic aneurysm.

640
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,620
When finding
tenderness of the

641
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:57,760
abdomen in any
of the areas

642
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,640
of the abdomen,

643
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:03,100
you want to try to
identify the possible

644
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:06,520
etiologies of that
tenderness. For example,

645
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:10,440
in the right upper
quadrant, in the area

646
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,940
of the liver and the
gallbladder, there might

647
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:15,820
be the presence of
cholecystitis might

648
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:19,770
be the reason for that
tenderness present.

649
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,520
In the left upper
quadrant you

650
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:26,160
may find peptic
ulcer disease

651
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,920
or even a pulmonary
pathology.

652
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,800
Epigastric can
be indication of

653
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,860
pancreatitis or
peptic ulcer disease.

654
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,340
Periumbilical can be

655
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:42,760
appendicitis, the same as

656
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:46,380
for the right
lower quadrant.

657
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:51,600
Suprapubic, you can
have bladder or uterine

658
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,280
pathology in the
flanks. That would

659
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,100
be for renal
pathology for either

660
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:03,200
pyelonephritis or the
presence of an abscess. In

661
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,260
the right lower
quadrant you can have

662
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:08,660
the appendicitis,
seagull diverticulitis.

663
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,960
In the left lower
quadrant you

664
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,900
might find sigmoid
diverticulitis

665
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:17,000
or even ovarian
pathology.

666
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,860
We can counsel
patients on

667
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:26,240
preventative measures
to reduce risk.

668
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,360
He re-selected
colon cancer.

669
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,660
Factors that are known to

670
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:34,300
increase the risk
of colon cancer

671
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:37,220
are excessive
alcohol intake,

672
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:40,240
cigarette smoking,
and obesity.

673
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,650
All of these
are modifiable.

674
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:47,520
Factors that can
decrease the risk of

675
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:51,480
colon cancer include
regular physical activity

676
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:55,160
and taking a baby
aspirin daily. The

677
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,460
United States
Preventative Services Task

678
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:00,320
Force recommendations
for colon cancer

679
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:04,660
screening is to begin
the screening at age

680
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:11,140
45 and continue until
age 75 years. You

681
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:14,850
can actually do colon
cancer screening after

682
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:19,140
75 years if the patient
meets the criteria

683
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:21,660
that's also listed
on United States

684
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:24,960
Preventative Services
Task Force website.

685
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:30,340
The CDC recommends
certain screening tests

686
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:32,780
such as stool tests
that are generally

687
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:37,420
done once a year. There
is also one called

688
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:40,780
Cologuard that is done
every three years,

689
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:44,120
sigmoidoscopy that
is done every five

690
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:47,720
years, and colonoscopy
every 10 years.

691
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:51,720
There is also CT
colonography that is

692
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:54,080
done every five
years. All of these

693
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:58,000
measures can be offered
to the patients.

694
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:01,820
Now let's look at
the osteopathic

695
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:04,880
consideration of
lower bowel disorders.

696
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:08,340
For the sympathetics,
you want to

697
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:12,140
consider T10 to
T11 for the right

698
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:15,300
side of the colon
and and T12 to

699
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,880
L2 for the left
side of the colon.

700
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:20,520
For parasympathetics,

701
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:24,520
the vagus would be
the innervation for

702
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:28,190
the right side of the
colon and the pelvic

703
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:31,500
splanchnic nerves
for the left side of

704
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:34,780
the colon. You can
also consider Chapman

705
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:37,620
points which would be
found at the lateral

706
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:41,380
sides of the thighs
in the anterior half

707
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:45,280
of the ilial tibial
bands bilaterally.

708
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,400
We started off this with

709
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,810
the case presentation.

710
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,920
Here is the complete
subjective of

711
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:59,260
this patient's
case presentation,

712
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,660
which was of a
patient complaining of

713
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:05,760
constipation that had been
worsening over the past

714
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,660
three to four months
she had complained

715
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:12,080
about having one to
two bowel movements per

716
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:15,920
week straining to ********
producing hard stools

717
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:19,160
and many time feeling
she does not completely

718
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:23,500
evacuate she's already
tried increasing

719
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:26,780
fiber and fluid eating
prunes and drinking

720
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:29,540
produce juice but none
of that has helped.

721
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:34,600
She did admit to
some weight gain but

722
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:37,940
denied nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea,

723
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:41,300
blood in the stool,
abdominal pain,

724
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:44,220
fever, chills, or
weight loss. And her

725
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:47,460

she has hypertension,

726
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:48,460

727
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:52,400

729
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:01,760

if she takes it her

730
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:06,620
medications include
diltiazam 120 milligrams

731

746
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:06,420
vaccine, the last one
in September of 2019.

747
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:10,300
In review of systems,

748
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:15,100
she denied fever,
chills, chest pain,

749
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:17,320

weight gain,

758
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:43,780
and skin dryness.
this already starts

759
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:48,300
to point in one
direction of what are the

760
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:52,500
possible scenarios
or differential

761
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:56,580
diagnosis for her
constipation complaint.

762
00:44:57,870 --> 00:45:01,640
Now let's look at
her the physical

763
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:04,740
examination, what
potential assessment

764
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:08,000
and differential
diagnosis and the plan

765
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,140
for us to consider.
her vitals are

766
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:16,360
as listed she is
slightly overweight

767
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:20,700
the rest of them her
vitals are stable

768
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:25,440
generally she appears
as stated aged well

769
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:29,100
groomed not in
apparent distress her

770
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:33,100
chest is clear to
auscultation heart is

771
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:36,960
s1 s2 is present with
a regular rate and

772
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,820
rhythm no murmurs
regurgitation gallop.

773
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:42,170
Her lung is clear
to auscultation

774
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:45,350
bilaterally, no wheezes,
rung eyes, or rails.

775
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:50,080
Her abdomen, you
find positive

776
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:53,200
hypoactive bowel sounds.

777
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:58,080
It is soft and non
-tender, non-distended.

778
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:01,880
You did not find
hepatosplenomegaly or palpable

779
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:06,680
masses no bruise
dilated veins no rebound

780
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:09,940
or guarding
percussion sounds were

781
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:14,120
tympanitic in all four
quadrants her extremities

782
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:16,820
there was no clubbing
cyanosis or edema

783
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:19,740
you did not see
varicosities they were warm

784
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:24,320
the pulses were two
plus times four her

785
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:29,040
joints had no synovitis
swelling or redness on

786
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:33,060
your skin exam you
found a rash there was

787
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:37,660
good turgor and you
did find dryness her

788
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:40,600
musculoskeletal exam
revealed good range of

789
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:43,440
motion for the upper
and lower extremities

790
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:47,620
for muscle strength it
was five out of five

791
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:51,040
for all four
extremities deep tendon

792
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:55,600
refurcals were normal
for all four extremities,

793
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:58,480
Romberg was negative.

794
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:01,640
On ****** exam you found

795
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:03,420
no external lesions,

796
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:05,860
her sphincter
tone was good,

797
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,940
no ****** masses,

798
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:13,640
the stool was soft
in the ****** boat.

799
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:17,800
On osteopathic
structural exam,

800
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:20,260
you found L1
flex side bent

801
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:23,740
and rotated and
side bent left.

802
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:27,280
Her guiac stool
was negative

803
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,130
and so was her urine.

804
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:32,920
So for differential
diagnosis, we can

805
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:36,300
consider hypothyroidism
that would correlate

806
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:39,920
with the presence of
Bertiligo is the two

807
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:44,080
of them can could
occur being that both

808
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:47,120
of them can have an
ideology of being

809
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:52,920
autoimmune we can also
consider irritable

810
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:56,820
bowel syndrome functional
constipation also

811
00:47:56,820 --> 00:48:00,160
medication induced
constipation as calcium

812
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:03,100
channel blockers can
cause constipation

813
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:06,640
in fact in the elderly
it is very common

814
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:11,150
to have constipation
from calcium channel

815
00:48:11,150 --> 00:48:13,700
blockers as well as
other medications.

816
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:18,140
She does have
hypertension

817
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:21,440
which is controlled.

818
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:24,340
She is overweight and

819
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:26,500
she does have a vitiligo.

820
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:30,980
These last are
all part of her

821
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:33,520
history except for
the being overweight.

822
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:35,880
In the labs,
we would want

823
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:39,400
to do thyroid
stimulating hormone,

824
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:43,120
check for anemia, do a

825
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:45,240
comprehensive
metabolic panel,

826
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:49,280
and check for
guaiac stools

827
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,720
times three to
make sure that

828
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:54,040
there is no
presence of blood.

829
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:58,300
Consider a
gastroenterology consult.

830
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:01,500
Consider discontinued
diltiazem

831
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:04,020
once lab results
are known.

832
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:07,860
You want to consider
the current medications

833
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:10,640
for now, counsel the
patient on weight

834
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:14,020
loss, discuss skin
care, use sunblock

835
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:16,660
lotions because
of the presence of

836
00:49:16,670 --> 00:49:20,800
vitiligo, refer her to
dermatology, follow up

837
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,520
in two weeks, and
also discuss with her

838
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:28,480
getting the current
flu vaccine.

839
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:32,800
In summary,

840
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:36,060
you're going to
do the following.

841
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:38,860
Consider the
patient's discomfort

842
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:40,680
with discussing
their problems.

843
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:44,060
This should be
for any type of

844
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:46,280
complaint, but
there are complaints

845
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:48,540
that are more
sensitive to others.

846
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:51,460
Observe the
patient from the

847
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:53,820
right side of
the patient.

848
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:55,900
Not your right side, the

849
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:57,380
right side of
the patient.

850
00:49:58,220 --> 00:50:01,060
Explain always to
the patient what

851
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:04,860
you are doing and
always inform them

852
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:07,500
of the results of
your examination.

853
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:12,420
Observe the patient
for signs of pain.

854
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:16,440
Don't rely on verbal
cues. There are

855
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:18,980
patients that are
very stoic and will

856
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:21,440
not verbalize, but
you can also see

857
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:24,500
that they're in pain
when you're doing

858
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:27,100
the examination by
looking at them.

859
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:33,780
these are the references
that were used

860
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:37,120
for this the preparation
of this lecture

861
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:41,100
they're all listed
