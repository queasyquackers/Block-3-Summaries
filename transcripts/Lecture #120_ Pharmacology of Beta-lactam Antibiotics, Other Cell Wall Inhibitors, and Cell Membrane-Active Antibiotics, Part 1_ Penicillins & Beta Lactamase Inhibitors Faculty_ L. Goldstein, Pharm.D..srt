1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,560
Welcome students to
the Pharmacology of

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,640
Antibiotics. This is
Dr. Goldstein speaking.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,640
This is a two-part
lecture and this

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,020
is the first
part. We will talk

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,460
about the penicillins
class, the beta

6
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,200
-lactamase inhibitors,
but we will

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,600
start with some
general information.

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,260
General information is
important to put you

9
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:27,580
into the picture, the
big picture, so that

10
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:30,560
you can see how the
pharmacology fits in.

11
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:39,330
Here are the
learning objectives

12
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,950
and they are the
same for both because

13
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:43,950
this really is
only one lecture.

14
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:48,880
You'll see it's
quite extensive and

15
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:51,090
the point with
these learning

16
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,450
objectives is that they
are interconnected.

17
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:57,150
They are part
of the whole.

18
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,990
It's the relationship
between pharmacokinetics

19
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:04,090
and pharmacodynamics
just to remind you

20
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:07,890
the concentration
of drug in the blood

21
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,610
determines the concentration
at the site of action

22
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:14,790
and that in turn
determines the effect.

23
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,610
You will be
able to practice

24
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:24,570
interweaving,
interleaving, interjoining

25
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:27,950
concepts when you work on

26
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:29,290
the practice questions.

27
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:35,270
I've put in red
mechanisms, mechanisms,

28
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:37,730
mechanisms,
mechanisms of action,

29
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:41,410
mechanisms of
resistance, the reason

30
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:43,630
for the various
antibacterial

31
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:47,550
spectrums, and of
course patient safety.

32
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:52,050
Patient safety is
determined by, one, the

33
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:56,190
dose and the correct
drug for the correct use

34
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:00,070
in the correct patient,
as well as being

35
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:04,770
aware of potential drug
-drug interactions and

36
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,550
contraindications
to use and

37
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:09,490
the patient
-specific factors.

38
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:19,610
Here's a list of the
preparation materials.

39
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,060
The only requirement
for me is the

40
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,600
practice questions. All
the rest are optional.

41
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,680
This video lecture
is optional if you

42
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,300
feel it is valuable
to you by all means. I

43
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:38,090
hope you will use it
and gain information

44
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,900
from it, gain learning,
gain knowledge.

45
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:48,320
And the companion
handout that I have

46
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,660
prepared has all the
information you need

47
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:56,040
for answering the
practice questions. It's

48
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:01,300
intended to just be
explanatory of the

49
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:05,680
concepts that are
given in this lecture.

50
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,940
Certainly you don't
have to memorize it.

51
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,540
It's there as a
resource, an optional

52
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,940
resource, and guided
reading questions

53
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:17,240
the same thing. It's
an optional resource

54
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,000
if you find it
valuable. If you don't

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,180
wish to use any of
these materials for

56
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:25,280
learning, certainly
there are textbooks,

57
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,960
review books, all
kinds of other sources.

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,400
I am not recommending
that you use all of

59
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,420
them. Just pick out
what works for you.

60
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,720
I've also included
suggestions on how to

61
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,740
learn pharmacology.
Students asked me that

62
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:47,310
over and over and over
and my recommendation

63
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:51,060
is to think about
the big picture.

64
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:55,800
Start with the big
overview and work your way

65
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,420
downwards from there.
In In this lecture

66
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:04,040
I have done it that
way and my goal is to

67
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,180
help you think it
through in a way that's

68
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:13,820
actually achievable
and helpful to you.

69
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,580
Here are some
links if you wish

70
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:23,200
to use them and
some study hints.

71
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,100
As I said, it's the
big picture overview.

72
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,540
you start with the
basics, look for patterns,

73
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,560
chunk ideas
together. That

74
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,240
makes the
learning smaller.

75
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:40,680
If you start by
memorizing drug names,

76
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:45,240
foreign language
as far as you're

77
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,900
concerned most of the
time, and then you try

78
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,020
and learn every
detail about each and

79
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:55,350
every drug, you're
just making a huge

80
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:59,080
burden for yourself.
Start at the top.

81
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,100
Basics, patterns,

82
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:03,760
chunking, and then
when you get around

83
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,080
to it, that's the
time to learn the

84
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,470
drug names and the
one or two specific

85
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:11,500
features about the
starred drugs that

86
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,680
I'm asking you to
memorize by name.

87
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,740
It's important
to be able to

88
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,900
use the drug
names. Say them out

89
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,880
loud. Make them
your friend.

90
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,700
When you go into your
clinical rotations,

91
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,020
you can't say, oh,
you know that drug

92
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:28,740
that's got a spectrum
of this and a mechanism

93
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,780
of that. I don't
remember the name, but

94
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,380
this is what they do.
No, you need to know

95
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:36,260
the drug names. Make
them your friends.

96
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:42,060
And here is why.
You will be treating

97
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,940
patients. In
order to treat

98
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,640
infection, you'll
need to know what

99
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,980
the likely infectious
causes are.

100
00:05:55,340 --> 00:06:00,260
Now here are some
key points. I'm

101
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,940
not going to go
over all of these

102
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,200
slides. They're
key points for you.

103
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:08,400
They are to help you
get into the frame

104
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,740
of the antibiotics
lectures in general.

105
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,500
So this is
introductory material

106
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,740
that may help
you. Just read

107
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,840
through it. It isn't
for memorizing.

108
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,800
These are the
bacterial pathogens

109
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,440
that you are
going to need to

110
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,240
know by name
for this course.

111
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:35,000
I have organized
them according to

112
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,540
patterns and chunking.
I will be returning

113
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:43,880
to this slide to
demonstrate, to

114
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,700
illustrate, the
various spectrums of

115
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,600
action of each of
the drug categories.

116
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,900
Hopefully, when you
see them, it will

117
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,580
help you make a visual
picture and make the

118
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:59,520
whole learning process
easier for you.

119
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,060
More key points that you

120
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,430
need to know
and understand.

121
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,380
And further.

122
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:15,760
And this tree is
not for you to

123
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,600
memorize, certainly.
but hopefully it

124
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,260
will help you
organize your thinking

125
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:25,080
about the
pathogenic bacteria.

126
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,740
They are
organized as limbs

127
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,300
and branches on the tree.

128
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,720
You can use this
tree or not.

129
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,040
We will be talking
about pathogens

130
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,540
that actually
are residents

131
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:46,180
of the normal
human microbiota.

132
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,340
An interesting fact
that you don't have

133
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:53,140
to memorize is that
we harbor 10 times

134
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:56,560
more microbial cells
than human cells.

135
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,680
They may be symbiotic

136
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,400
working together with us.

137
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,900
They are commensals.

138
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:07,480
And most of them have
not yet been associated

139
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,920
with disease. But some
can cause some very

140
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:15,600
serious drug-resistant
infections. and

141
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:20,880
I've pointed to the
takeaway microbiota cause

142
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,700
infection when there
is a break in the

143
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:28,180
barrier and they are able
to ********* into body

144
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,960
sites that is not
their natural habitat.

145
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:37,700
For example, when the
intestine is penetrated,

146
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:42,020
whether it's by
trauma or disease, the

147
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:47,600
organisms can move
from the gut into past

148
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,060
the intestine into
the bloodstream into

149
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:53,440
the peritoneum and can
cause some very serious

150
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:59,900
even deadly infections
so the microbiota

151
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,240
that we will normally
be talking about in

152
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,560
terms of our pathogenic
organisms our skin

153
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,560
********* the skin,
we take the skin

154
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:15,140
infection, sorry, the
skin organisms into the

155
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:18,220
bloodstream, and that
can cause infection.

156
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:22,400
Staph and strep are
the two that I'm asking

157
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,720
you to remember.
Staphylococcus aureus,

158
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,690
Staphylococcus epidermidis,
and Streptococcus

159
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:31,940
species. There are
many more, but these

160
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,340
are the ones I'm
asking you to remember.

161
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,660
And in the
nasopharynx, there are

162
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,120
lots and lots of
organisms there,

163
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,560
commensals, symbionts.

164
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,220
The ones that I'm
asking you to remember

165
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,680
are Neisseria
meningitidis, and

166
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,580
as the name suggests,
it can cause

167
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:54,200
meningitis, but it
can also cause other

168
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,780
things like like
inner ear infection,

169
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:03,440
otitis media, and
rhinosinusitis, so

170
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,620
these upper
respiratory infections.

171
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:10,800
Streptococci live
there, especially the

172
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:16,320
viridin strep and
streptococcus pneumoniae.

173
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,300
Streptococcus
pneumoniae causes

174
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:25,280
streptococcal pneumonia
or Pneumococcus,

175
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,520
Staph aureus again,

176
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,760
Haemophilus species.
So these I have

177
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,820
in red because we
will be talking about

178
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,090
them. And there
are of course many

179
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,740
anaerobes around.
We're not going to

180
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,980
be mentioning them
to any great degree

181
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:43,260
except for the
Clostridia species.

182
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,520
Now on the GI tract,
mainly in the colon,

183
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:53,380
the highest microbial
density of any

184
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:56,600
human associated
microbial community.

185
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,120
And there, as I put
here on the slide, the

186
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,500
species are far too
numerous to list.

187
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,240
So we'll just talk
about a few of them.

188
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:09,540
In the normal
adult colon, 96

189
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,860
to 99% of the
resident bacteria

190
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,920
flora consist
of anaerobes.

191
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,740
Bacteroides
fragilis I have

192
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:21,380
highlighted in
red because it is

193
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,750
a difficult to
treat bacterium

194
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:29,040
that can infect when
it penetrates through

195
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,240
the intestine. And the
Clostridium species,

196
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,240
which we'll talk about
further in a moment.

197
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:38,770
And there are
a few there.

198
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:41,280
It's only 1% to 4%,
but we're still talking

199
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,220
about 1% to 4% of
billions and billions.

200
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:50,800
the enterobacteriales.
These are facultative

201
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:57,020
anaerobic rods or
bacilli. Now, when you

202
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:01,140
see facultative anaerobic,
they are categorized

203
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:04,740
as aerobes. So the
enterobacteriales

204
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:11,000
are E. coli, Klebsiella,
Proteus, Salmonella,

205
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Shigella. These all
are gram negative and

206
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,240
can cause some important
gastroenteritis,

207
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,300
bloodstream infections,

208
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,360
urinary tract infections
depending on the

209
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,360
organism. So they
are highly relevant.

210
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:35,020
Enterococcus fecalis
and faecium also live

211
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:41,110
in the gut but these
are gram gram positive

212
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,160
cocci as it says
right there and we'll

213
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,980
talk about those
because of the serious

214
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:51,200
infections they can
cause and of course there

215
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:56,460
are lots of there of
there's a microbiome in

216
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:59,140
the genitourinary tract
of male and female

217
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:04,180
females and I put
insert in a circle here

218
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:08,320
know this, secondary
infections can arise

219
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,320
from antibiotic therapy.
So we're treating

220
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:15,480
an infection with
antibiotics and

221
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,880
that can give
rise to another

222
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,560
infection. So how
is this happening?

223
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,940
The antibiotics,
particularly antibiotics

224
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:28,080
that are broad
spectrum, pass into the

225
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,290
gut or pass into
the gut circulation

226
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:35,940
will naturally cause
the death of susceptible

227
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,940
microorganisms
in our microbiome

228
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,520
that are not causing
anybody any trouble.

229
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,820
As a result, other
organisms that are not

230
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:50,180
susceptible to the
antibiotic therapy, such

231
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:55,060
as fungi, and
Clostridioides difficile,

232
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:00,220
which is a gram
-positive obligate

233
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:06,560
anaerobe that is
present in the gut

234
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,120
flora of many people,
not everybody,

235
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,380
this organism is
not killed by nearly

236
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:17,760
all antibiotics
and as a result it

237
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,500
can it has an
opportunity to overgrow

238
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:26,000
when the other
bacteria are killed.

239
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,000
So overgrowth of
Clostridioides difficile

240
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:38,220
C difficile can cause
diarrhea so this is

241
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,720
called C difficile
associated diarrhea.

242
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,820
Pseudomembranous
colitis, which as you can

243
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,160
see from the word,
is a colitis. It's an

244
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,700
inflammation of the
colon. And in rare,

245
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,440
fortunately rare,
circumstances, it can

246
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,860
cause megacolon, which
is life-threatening.

247
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,540
So that's C.
difficile, secondary

248
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:06,620
infection from
antibiotic therapy. Now,

249
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:09,500
I briefly mentioned
that fungi are

250
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:13,900
not susceptible to
antibiotic therapy.

251
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:21,140
Candida is a commensal
organism, and it can

252
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:26,940
overgrow when the
surrounding bacteria are

253
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:30,260
killed, and that can
cause a vaginal yeast

254
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:34,320
infection. And not
listed here, it can also

255
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:41,080
cause something called
thrush, which I want

256
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,560
you to remember,
and I'll bring it up

257
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,320
again. Thrush is a
candidal infection in the

258
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:51,280
mouth of the oral mucosa,
and you can recognize

259
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:55,100
it by this white
coating on the tongue.

260
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,680
Secondary infections.

261
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:08,700
now the target is in
the bacterial cell

262
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,590
wall so we need to
understand the structure

263
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:15,860
of the bacterial cell
wall which is made up

264
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:22,640
of sugars called
glycans amino sugars N

265
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:26,860
-acetylglucosamine, and
N-acetylmuramic acid,

266
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:30,190
and that's represented
by these circles,

267
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,180
the larger circles.

268
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:37,080
And they're labeled
here NAG and NAM.

269
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:42,040
Now the other
component is a peptide,

270
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,280
So it's a peptidoglycan
cell wall.

271
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:49,520
And the peptides
we see are

272
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,500
indicated by the
small circles.

273
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,780
I'm bringing
you back here

274
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,380
to these larger circles.

275
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,460
NAM,

276
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,120
the antacetylmuramic
acid,

277
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,880
has peptides attached.

278
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:10,940
the NAG portion, the
N-acetylglucosamine,

279
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:16,400
does not. So that's
the basic building

280
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,840
block of the peptidoglycan
cell wall, the NAM

281
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:27,520
-NAG with the 5-amino
acid peptide on it.

282
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:31,160
These peptides
now cross-link.

283
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:38,120
and that's what gives
this peptidoglycan

284
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,260
cell wall its
strong matrix.

285
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,660
The peptide cross
-linking occurs

286
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:52,680
with a
transpeptidase, trans

287
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:56,460
-cross-peptidase
-peptide-ase.

288
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,670
We'll get into more
details on that. Because

289
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:04,400
these peptides are
small, it's a five

290
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:13,960
-peptide string on the
NAM, and when it cross

291
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,520
-lengths, it becomes four
each, so it's called

292
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:20,300
an oligo-peptide,
meaning it's very short.

293
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:26,120
That's the terms. looking
now at the difference

294
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:29,100
between the cell
walls of the gram

295
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:32,220
-positive and gram-negative
organisms. This is

296
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:35,260
going to come up over
and over and over. This

297
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:38,240
is really valuable
information for you to

298
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,920
learn. The gram-positive
has this thick cell

299
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:47,280
wall and here's the
inner plasma membrane.

300
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,540
Gram-negative, here's
the interplasma

301
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:54,720
membrane, have a
very thin cell wall.

302
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:59,680
Additionally,
they have an outer

303
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,240
membrane, indicated
right here.

304
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:08,600
Now, this structure
on each is a capsule.

305
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,660
Not all bacteria have
a capsule. We are

306
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,800
interested, when we're
talking about the

307
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:20,240
antibiotic therapy, of
this outer wall because

308
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:27,310
in order to reach the
target in the cell

309
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:32,660
wall, the transpeptidase
or PBP, it has

310
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,300
to be able to get
through this outer

311
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:37,440
membrane. And not all
antibiotics can do that.

312
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,220
Also, there is a
periplasmic space with

313
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:45,420
the gram negatives,
and a lot of enzymes

314
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:49,660
and other proteins
hang out in that space.

315
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:54,460
We don't see that with
the gram positive.

316
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,820
So gram positive
means the gram

317
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:04,020
stain is positive.
It shows purple.

318
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:10,120
The gram-negative do
not take a gram stain.

319
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:13,080
Therefore, they
get stained with

320
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,600
a different color
so that they can

321
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,320
be visible under
the microscope.

322
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:23,960
The classes of the beta
-lactam's antibiotics

323
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,140
are the penicillins,
of which

324
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:32,220
penicillin itself is
the original prototype.

325
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:37,420
Next came the
cephalosporins, next

326
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:41,480
came the carbapenems,
and at last we

327
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:45,240
have one monobactam.
So that's the

328
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,090
order in which they
were developed.

329
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,620
The penicillins
and cephalosporins

330
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,600
are further
categorized by their

331
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,300
spectrum of action.
A narrow spectrum

332
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:59,020
means only a few
organisms are affected,

333
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:03,520
are susceptible
to these drugs.

334
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,760
Then there's the
extended spectrum.

335
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:10,800
More organisms are
susceptible to the drugs.

336
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:15,490
And we're thinking
about the gram-negative

337
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:21,060
when we think about
extended spectrum.

338
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,740
Gram-negative. More
gram-negatives.

339
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:33,090
and then we have
an extra one in the

340
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:35,140
penicillins group
which is good against

341
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:40,100
pseudomonas and an extra
one in the beta-lactam

342
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,560
antibiotics that's
good against MRSA.

343
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:46,740
Okay we will go into
more detail with these

344
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:50,000
as we move along.
I've also included

345
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,840
the other cell all
active antibiotics, and

346
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,420
we will only be talking
about vancomycin,

347
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:59,380
a very, very important
drug, and one

348
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,780
that's active actually
at the level of the

349
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:04,740
cell membrane, and
that's called daptomycin.

350
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:08,060
These two will be
covered in part two.

351
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,340
So let's get to it.

352
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,500
The beta-lactams
These are analogs

353
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,500
of d-ala-d-ala,
and here's our

354
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,680
structure-activity
relationship,

355
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:22,800
structure-activity
relationships.

356
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,960
Analogs of d
-ala-d-alanane,

357
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,460
so these are amino acids.

358
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,720
If you can use your
imagination here,

359
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:40,680
here we have our beta
-lactam ring. it's

360
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,420
included in this
other color and these

361
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:47,240
in this sketch this
red color so that

362
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,040
it's highlighting
the beta-lactam ring

363
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:53,860
hence the name beta
-lactam antibiotics.

364
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:57,300
This beta-lactam
ring is essential for

365
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:01,300
activity structure
activity relationship.

366
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:08,340
Penicillins have
this ring on them.

367
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:10,680
Cephalosporins have this
ring on them. So the

368
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:14,980
point is with these
different categories of

369
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:19,980
the drugs, the ring
is slightly different,

370
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:24,780
but they all have
this beta-lactam ring.

371
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:34,410
You do not have to
memorize these structures,

372
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:37,410
but you do have to
get the point of them.

373
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:40,310
Again, the activity
is the beta

374
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:43,370
-lactam ring. They
all must have it.

375
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:46,410
I want to point
out this enzyme.

376
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:50,170
Right here it's
pointing to the enzyme.

377
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:53,590
It's called beta
-lactamase, an enzyme

378
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:58,050
that breaks the
beta-lactam ring. So

379
00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:00,330
if the beta-lactam
ring is necessary

380
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:05,210
for activity and
that ring gets broken

381
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:09,990
or cleaved, will
the drug be active?

382
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:13,670
No. So this is what
we're thinking about

383
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:16,370
as one of the
resistance mechanisms.

384
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:19,950
Bacteria that produce
beta-lactamase

385
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:22,070
that cleaves that
beta-lactam ring.

386
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:28,150
Pharmacologic
properties are

387
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:30,350
the R groups that
are indicated

388
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:32,410
on all of these
structures.

389
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:35,690
You don't have to
memorize where they are.

390
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:38,570
What you just need
to understand is that

391
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:40,910
the R groups change
the properties of the

392
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:42,810
drug. So you may
say, okay, well, we

393
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:45,470
have penicillin G.
That was the first one.

394
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:48,890
And then we have a whole

395
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:51,250
list of other drugs.

396
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:52,950
What's the difference?

397
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:55,610
And the difference
is the R group. It

398
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:58,450
gives the drugs
different properties.

399
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:05,490
general pharmacokinetics
the beta laxans

400
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:09,990
it's so easy nearly
all of course not

401
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:14,870
all but nearly all
are typical of this

402
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:19,030
pharmacokinetic profile
they can be given

403
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:24,310
****** im or iv not
all of them ******,

404
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:31,450
and not all of them IM
or IV, but we can give

405
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:34,810
them oral IM or IV.
We have drugs that can

406
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:37,030
be given by all of
these different routes.

407
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:40,930
Intrasecal is not
recommended. Indeed,

408
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:43,850
it's generally
contraindicated because

409
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:48,470
it can cause severe
CNS irritation,

410
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:53,090
arachnoiditis, fatal
encephalopathy, other

411
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:56,710
things when the CNS
tissues are exposed

412
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:59,710
to high concentrations
of the drug, as

413
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:02,510
would occur with
intrathecal administration.

414
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:04,750
That means putting
it into the spine.

415
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:10,370
The drugs pretty
much stay in the body

416
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:15,430
fluids, but they're
widely distributed in

417
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:17,810
the body fluids, in
the blood, in the

418
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:21,750
interstitial fluids,
so they are effective

419
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:26,570
against all organisms
that are susceptible

420
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:32,490
to the individual
drugs that can

421
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:37,910
get to the various
extracellular spaces.

422
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:44,190
These drugs do not
cross inside cells.

423
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:47,230
They have poor
*********** of

424
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:49,390
the cerebral
spinal fluid when

425
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:51,830
it's not
inflamed. However,

426
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:54,990
inflamed cerebral
spinal fluid such

427
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:57,930
as occurs with
meningitis, excuse me,

428
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:02,190
inflamed meninges,
such as that occurs

429
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:06,310
with infection,
causes leakiness of

430
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:08,590
the blood-brain
barrier. And as a

431
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:12,630
result, the drugs can
********* into the

432
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:18,390
CSF in higher quantities
than normally,

433
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:21,010
and these are
therapeutic levels.

434
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:28,890
they do not pass
into the vitreous of

435
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:33,370
the eye they do not
pass into the the

436
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:36,330
prostate because
of one the retinal

437
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:39,230
blood retinal barriers
here the blood

438
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:43,070
prostate barriers
here and they do not

439
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:47,350
pass into phagocytic
cells or other host

440
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:52,150
cells that may be
harboring bacteria.

441
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:55,990
So think,

442
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:58,290
what is the distribution?

443
00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:00,830
Stays in the
fluids, goes pretty

444
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:04,410
much everywhere
except the CNS, except

445
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:06,190
when the meninges
are inflamed.

446
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:13,430
now that said we have
a few and you can

447
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:15,230
see they're cephalosporins
because they

448
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:21,950
all start with can
********* in relatively

449
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,850
high levels even
when the meninges are

450
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:36,750
not inflamed so what
is this meningitis.

451
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,690
See how to think
about that?

452
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:45,450
They're nearly
all eliminated

453
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:48,230
through the kidney
by glomerular

454
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:50,530
filtration and secretion.

455
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:54,870
So they go through
the transporters

456
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:56,270
in the proximal tubule.

457
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:04,320
There is a group that
we will be talking

458
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,100
about. I keep
saying nearly all,

459
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,340
nearly all, nearly
all, and it's this

460
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,680
group that has hepatic
metabolism. I'll

461
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,520
go into that more
when we get there.

462
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:16,340
They generally have
a pretty short half

463
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:18,840
-life. So short
half-life stays in

464
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,360
body fluids. What
does that say to you?

465
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:27,440
Frequent administration.

466
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:34,460
Short half-life
stays in body fluids.

467
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:35,980
Frequent administration.

468
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:39,160
Okay, so it's so much
easier to remember the

469
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,740
exception, isn't it?
There's an exception.

470
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,680
Ceftriaxone.
There you go. This

471
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,420
is a very, very
important drug. It

472
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:50,780
has a star on it.
I want to emphasize

473
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,740
the importance
of this drug.

474
00:29:57,510 --> 00:30:00,870
Beta-lactam's pharmacokinetic
pharmacodynamic

475
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:04,350
profile is T
greater than MIC,

476
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:06,250
time greater than minimum

477
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:08,070
inhibitory concentration.

478
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:14,630
the amount of time during
the dosing interval

479
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:18,190
that the serum drug
concentration stays

480
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:25,190
above the MIC is the
important thing not the

481
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:28,030
concentration well
concentration is important

482
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:31,770
of course but not in
terms of increased

483
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:35,910
bacterial killing rate the
higher the concentration

484
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:39,250
we don't get higher
rate of bacterial

485
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:41,930
killing. Of course
we have to achieve

486
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:46,630
concentrations that are
going to be therapeutic.

487
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:50,950
So time dependent,
minimal persistent

488
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,670
effects, and
the drugs are

489
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:54,630
generally
bactericidal. Of course

490
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:56,730
there's always an
exception to that.

491
00:30:57,130 --> 00:31:02,850
We see on this figure
that But the time

492
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:05,530
below the minimum in
inventory concentration

493
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:08,430
really has to be
minimized. It has to stay

494
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:14,190
up in the therapeutic
range for basically

495
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:20,570
the highest, for basically
most of the time.

496
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,050
Now let's talk
about the target in

497
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:30,410
the peptidoglycan
cell wall. This is

498
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:33,430
the whole cell wall
synthesis process.

499
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:37,830
You absolutely do not

500
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:39,150
need to remember this.

501
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:44,250
It starts out
with one molecule

502
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:52,530
by molecule by
molecule in the

503
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:55,410
intracellular space
of the bacteria.

504
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:58,730
It gets to the point
where we get the

505
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:05,410
building block, the
peptidoglycan component,

506
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:08,670
and it's carried across.
It's like a ferry.

507
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:15,310
It carries it to the
other side, and there

508
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:18,390
the peptidoglycans
are joined together.

509
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:22,710
And after that, the
cross-linking occurs.

510
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:28,690
So the beta-lactams
interrupt the last

511
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:31,930
step, the cell wall
cross-linking step.

512
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:40,510
This is a close
-up view of

513
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:45,830
the process of
cross-linking.

514
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:49,190
We have our
building blocks, our

515
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:53,630
NAMNAG pentapeptide
subunits. I've

516
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:58,330
indicated this D
-ala, D-ala, two amino

517
00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:00,670
acids at the end of
the pentapeptide,

518
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:04,490
the alanine that I
mentioned before.

519
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:09,150
This arrow points to
the transpeptidase.

520
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:12,590
Transpeptidase is
the type of enzyme,

521
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:15,550
and they are
commonly referred

522
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:18,970
to as penicillin
-binding proteins.

523
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:23,810
Even before the function
of this protein,

524
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:26,650
this transpeptidase,
was identified,

525
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:30,850
the penicillins were
found to bind to some

526
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:32,910
protein in the bacteria,
and therefore they

527
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:35,550
were called penicillin
-binding proteins.

528
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:40,230
So they are important,
essential for the

529
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:44,630
cross-linking step.
And if we block that,

530
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:51,230
beta-lactamases,
sorry, beta-lactams

531
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:55,590
bind the transpeptidase
to PBP, blocks the

532
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:58,070
cross-linking step.
So what happens now?

533
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:02,110
The, it's going to block

534
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:03,490
the cell wall synthesis.

535
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:06,870
It's going to, the
organism is going to

536
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:09,530
recognize that its cell
wall is not synthesizing

537
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:13,230
properly. that will
trigger the repair

538
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:17,090
team the auto license
the auto license come

539
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:19,670
out and make little
holes in order for

540
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:24,890
the peptidoglycan
synthesis step to continue

541
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:27,750
properly and this is
fine as long as there

542
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:30,750
is maybe a hole here
or there and they fix

543
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:35,450
it but with the beta
-lactam antibiotics

544
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:38,330
blocking transpeptidase.
There's widespread

545
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:43,510
inhibition of that
cell wall synthesis.

546
00:34:43,970 --> 00:34:48,470
So now these
autolycens come out,

547
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:49,970
make these little
holes all over

548
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:53,400
the place, and that
can allow fluid

549
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,210
to rush in and
osmotic rupture.

550
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:58,790
And there are also
probably non-lytic

551
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:02,770
mechanisms involved
as well. So, recap,

552
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:04,930
bind PPP,

553
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:06,870
block cross-linking,

554
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:08,930
trigger auto-license,

555
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:11,330
osmotic rupture,

556
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:14,610
probably non-lytic
mechanisms. That's it.

557
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:18,790
This is just a
picture to help you

558
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:23,970
visualize the cross
-linked cell wall. So

559
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:27,430
you can see it's a
nice, strong matrix,

560
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:31,230
a wall, to protect
the bacterium.

561
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:36,370
Resistance,
resistance, resistance.

562
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:39,210
This is a common theme of

563
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:43,590
all antimicrobials
and cancer.

564
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:46,070
But here we're going
to limit ourselves

565
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:49,450
to the beta-lactam
resistance, acquired

566
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:51,290
resistance,
intrinsic resistance.

567
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:56,190
Acquired resistance
is the organisms

568
00:35:56,190 --> 00:36:00,110
develop enzymes that
will degrade the drugs,

569
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:05,990
beta-lactamases
that cleave that

570
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:08,310
beta-lactam ring.
And this is the

571
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:10,230
major mechanism
of resistance.

572
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:13,010
For staphylococci,

573
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:17,650
so this is MSSA, which
I'll go to in more

574
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:22,970
detail. and gram
-negative bacteria, GNBs.

575
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:25,270
Everything has to have
an acronym, it seems.

576
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:30,030
Another mechanism is
to modify the target

577
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:35,710
to cause a change
in that penicillin

578
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:38,930
-binding protein with
low affinity for the

579
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:44,910
drug, which will still
be able to participate

580
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:47,330
in the synthesis
of the cell wall.

581
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:49,490
So mutations in the

582
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:52,290
transpeptidase,
the PBP genes,

583
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:54,190
that result in
low affinity

584
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:55,630
binding of the drug.

585
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:58,030
So I've indicated here

586
00:36:58,030 --> 00:37:00,630
Staphylococcus MRSA now.

587
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:03,770
Methicillin-resistant
Staph aureus,

588
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:05,230
methicillin
-sensitive Staph

589
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:06,810
aureus. When we get
to that group of

590
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:09,070
drugs, I'll go
into more detail.

591
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:12,490
Other mechanism
is to reduce the

592
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:15,210
concentration of drug
at the site of action.

593
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:20,710
So, the drug can't
get to the target.

594
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:23,870
This can happen in the
gram-negative bacteria

595
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:27,910
by changes in the
porins that are

596
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:31,970
passageways through
that outer membrane.

597
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:38,050
Also, pumping it out,
efflux. So, that will

598
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:40,050
reduce the concentration
at the site of

599
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:43,610
action. And then there
are certain organisms

600
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:45,710
that are just
intrinsically resistant.

601
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:49,010
The beta-lactams
have never

602
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:50,590
been effective
against them.

603
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:55,010
If they are
intracellular, they're

604
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:57,030
obligate intracellular,
well, the

605
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:58,670
beta-lactams
can't get to them.

606
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:06,010
And atypicals, which
are either obligate

607
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:08,600
intracellular or
they don't have PBPs.

608
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:10,610
So no target.

609
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:15,270
Here's a little
mnemonic. I didn't

610
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:17,270
make it up. I got
it out of a book.

611
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:19,110
The six Ps.

612
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:22,200
Penicillinases, but
think beta-lactamases.

613
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:26,550
PBPs, porins, pumps,
***********, and

614
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:28,930
peptidoglycan. I hope
that'll help you.

615
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:37,970
Beta-lactam antibiotics
kill bacteria cells

616
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:40,570
only when they're
actively growing and

617
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:44,370
synthesizing a cell
wall. Obviously, because

618
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:49,830
that's when the
transpeptidases are busy.

619
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:55,310
Bacteria in biofilms
formed on prosthetic

620
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:59,370
devices are much less
sensitive to antibiotics

621
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:03,850
because these organisms
are able to produce

622
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:08,970
a coating that prevents
the beta-lactam

623
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:11,570
from actually accessing
them. Furthermore,

624
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:14,250
they usually are
large populations,

625
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:17,710
so they are not
growing so fast.

626
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:27,080
Don't use antibiotics
for viral infections.

627
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:30,380
Viruses do not respond

628
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:32,320
to antibiotic therapy.

629
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:38,420
Okay, so you have a
patient or a patient's

630
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:41,340
mother or father or
caregiver who says,

631
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:46,660
well i know it's a
viral infection but it

632
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:50,620
might be a bacterial
infection maybe the

633
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:53,080
maybe my family
members should have an

634
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:58,160
antibiotic just in case
just in case and it's so

635
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:01,020
tempted so tempting
to think well okay i

636
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:04,160
mean what can it hurt
well it can hurt first

637
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:08,560
of all we don't give
drugs that are not

638
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:12,280
going to be useful
it's just not right

639
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:15,880
secondly antibiotics do
have side effects we're

640
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:19,020
allowing these the
patient to be exposed

641
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:22,300
to side effects for
no reason furthermore

642
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:29,740
unnecessary antibiotic
use promotes resistance

643
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:34,800
in organisms and
finally many antibiotics

644
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,360
are very expensive
and not everybody

645
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,880
can afford them. So
this is an unnecessary

646
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:43,120
cost for the patient
or a patient's family.

647
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:47,440
Antibiotic selection
is based on the site of

648
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,340
the infection. Can the
drug get to the site

649
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:54,120
of infection? The
spectrums of activity. We

650
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,800
have to select drugs
that are going to be

651
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,420
effective and not all
drugs are effective

652
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:02,880
against everything. We
have to think about the

653
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,580
potential for microbial
resistance. In other

654
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:09,020
words, is the patient
infected with a microbe

655
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:11,880
that's going to be
resistant to the drug?

656
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:14,240
Of course, patient
factors. Is

657
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,900
it safe for the
patient? Can

658
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,620
the patient
acquire the drug?

659
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:22,800
Remember, there are
a number of pharmacy

660
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,740
deserts in this
country where

661
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:28,380
patients can't even
get to a pharmacy.

662
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,140
We have to think
about the toxicity of

663
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,820
the drug and the
cost to the patient.

664
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:42,420
Beta-lactams are
so, so, so useful.

665
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:47,340
I would say they are
the most frequently

666
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:50,980
used drugs for
the treatment of

667
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:52,860
bacterial infections.
But, of course,

668
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:54,660
the infections must
be susceptible.

669
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:59,440
And infections can
occur any place. I

670
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:03,160
put a list here, but
this is intuitive.

671
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,120
They can just
occur everywhere.

672
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,800
Now, our drug
selection. Well, how

673
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,800
do we think about
selecting the drug?

674
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:12,140
We need a drug with
activity against

675
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:14,420
the infectious
pathogen. We need

676
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:15,840
a drug that
distributes to the

677
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,820
site of action. It
has to get there.

678
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:21,580
At a dose that
achieves adequate

679
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,320
therapeutic concentration

680
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:27,020
by the appropriate
route of administration

681
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,640
and is not
contraindicated

682
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,180
in the individual
patient.

683
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:33,740
Again, intuitive.

684
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:39,820
The most important
adverse effect of

685
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:43,740
penicillins is
hypersensitivity reactions.

686
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,860
Now penicillins are
pretty small molecules.

687
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:49,060
I think you could
appreciate thinking about

688
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:51,780
their chemical
structure. So on their

689
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:56,240
own, they don't cause
allergic reactions.

690
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:00,900
However, penicillins,
other beta-lactams, or

691
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:06,400
their metabolites, can
cause hapten formation.

692
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,520
hapten. Please know
this word hapten.

693
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:15,310
Where the drug will
bind, the drug of a

694
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:19,580
metabolite, will bind
covalently to a protein,

695
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:24,080
a host protein. And
the red blood cell

696
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:26,840
membrane is typical
of the penicillin.

697
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,920
So protein on the red
blood cell membrane.

698
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,500
Now antibodies
created against this

699
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:35,320
drug protein complex
can stimulate an

700
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:39,360
immune attack, and
that can lead to

701
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:42,460
hemolytic anemia as
the red blood cells

702
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:46,580
are lysed because of
this immune attack.

703
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:53,720
So, well, okay, it's
a well-known adverse

704
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:57,200
effect of
penicillins, but what

705
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,660
about the potential
for cross-reactivity

706
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:03,020
with others in the
beta-lactam group.

707
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:05,660
This has been a
subject of debate

708
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:09,820
since the beginning
of all these

709
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:11,820
other groups of
beta-lactams.

710
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:16,940
What it has boiled
down to is that the

711
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:19,760
cross-reactivity potential
with cephalosporins

712
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,520
in particular and
other beta-lactams

713
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,940
is related to
structural similarities.

714
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:26,760
So structural
similarities of what? we

715
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,540
know they all have
a beta-lactam ring

716
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:31,040
they have other
rings well it's the

717
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:34,640
similarities of the
side chains so to

718
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:39,400
any drugs that has
a side chain that's

719
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:42,260
similar to another
beta-lactam that a

720
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:44,420
patient had an
allergic reaction to is

721
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:48,820
likely to be cross
-reactive so how do

722
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:51,460
we know sometimes
people will come in

723
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:54,420
and Say, I had an
allergic reaction to

724
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:56,960
penicillin. Well,
how did it manifest?

725
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,400
Well, I had a
stomachache. Well,

726
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,160
that's not an
allergic reaction.

727
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:03,900
It's an effective
penicillin. It

728
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:05,500
can cause a
stomachache, but

729
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:07,280
that's not an
allergic reaction.

730
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,830
So you need to
delve into that. And

731
00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:12,360
if a person really,
really needs that

732
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,560
penicillin, skin
testing can be done.

733
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:18,960
And I put some statistics
here. This is for

734
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,760
you to get you into
the context, but you

735
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:25,200
don't have to memorize
statistics for me.

736
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:27,380
Remember,

737
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,380
beta-lactams are
among the leading

738
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:35,060
causes of drug
-induced anaphylaxis.

739
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:39,410
This is a serious type
1 hypersensitivity

740
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:43,100
reaction, an
allergic reaction.

741
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,700
anaphylaxis can
lead to anaphylactic

742
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:51,120
shock which
can cause death

743
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,780
in the matter of minutes

744
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:08,930
hypotension
bronchoconstriction death

745
00:46:08,990 --> 00:46:12,650
anaphylactic shock
and it fortunately

746
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:16,340
it's treatable but
it needs to be very

747
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:19,450
rapidly treated
airway respiratory

748
00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:22,650
cardiovascular
support, the usual ABC.

749
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:25,470
Epinephrine,
antihistamines,

750
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:26,590
glucocorticoids.

751
00:46:26,810 --> 00:46:29,710
Epinephrine,
epinephrine, epinephrine.

752
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:32,520
We will be studying
epinephrine

753
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:35,410
in another
couple of months.

754
00:46:36,590 --> 00:46:38,530
This is your
introduction.

755
00:46:41,110 --> 00:46:43,490
Angioedema, this
is a vasculitis of

756
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:45,270
the deeper vessels
and it can cause

757
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:48,350
swelling. It can be
life-threatening when

758
00:46:48,350 --> 00:46:50,730
it involves the
airways, the tongue.

759
00:46:53,390 --> 00:46:56,850
Serum sickness, now
this is a type 3 delayed

760
00:46:57,270 --> 00:47:01,810
type reaction. It
can occur days later.

761
00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:05,150
Immunohemolysis,
the hemolytic

762
00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:06,690
anemia I
mentioned before.

763
00:47:07,350 --> 00:47:08,870
Serious rash,

764
00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:12,050
Stevens-Johnson syndrome,
from toxic epidermal

765
00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:13,930
necrolysis, you can
tell by the name,

766
00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:18,430
toxic and
necrolysis and skin.

767
00:47:19,850 --> 00:47:22,330
Fever, interstitial
nephritis,

768
00:47:22,330 --> 00:47:25,210
vasculitis, neutropenia,
thrombocytopenia.

769
00:47:25,370 --> 00:47:29,590
So, certainly
this only happens

770
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:31,450
to a small
percentage of people,

771
00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:33,530
but millions, millions of

772
00:47:33,530 --> 00:47:36,270
people get antibiotics,

773
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:38,010
get beta-lactams,

774
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:39,690
And so we have to be

775
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:42,930
vigilant and
monitor for it.

776
00:47:44,550 --> 00:47:45,930
Some pictures.

777
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:48,730
On the left is
this child with

778
00:47:48,730 --> 00:47:51,410
angioedema. You can
see the swollen lips.

779
00:47:53,430 --> 00:47:56,290
And the mucous
membranes on the inside

780
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:58,340
of the mouth would
be swollen also.

781
00:47:59,270 --> 00:48:02,530
And there can be
swelling in the airways.

782
00:48:02,930 --> 00:48:07,030
urticaria. This
individual in the middle

783
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:10,750
has this rash all
over her trunk and

784
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:13,550
on her arms, probably
on her face too.

785
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:17,350
This is an urticarial
rash. I used a

786
00:48:17,350 --> 00:48:19,830
picture of a light
-skinned person so that

787
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:22,430
you could really
be able to see it.

788
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:25,130
And here's Stevens
-Johnson syndrome,

789
00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:29,410
which is a toxic
reaction in the skin.

790
00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:32,530
And this poor person
here, you can see

791
00:48:32,530 --> 00:48:35,050
it all around the
lips. Toxic epidermal

792
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:38,430
necrolysis is terrible
and involves a

793
00:48:38,430 --> 00:48:40,930
large percentage of
the skin surface.

794
00:48:43,930 --> 00:48:48,110
Well, of course,
the non-aminogenic

795
00:48:48,110 --> 00:48:50,640
side effects tend
to be more frequent.

796
00:48:51,850 --> 00:48:54,450
Diarrhea, I'm not
talking about C.

797
00:48:54,450 --> 00:48:56,750
difficile-associated
diarrhea, just normal

798
00:48:56,750 --> 00:48:59,210
diarrhea that can
occur with antibiotic

799
00:48:59,210 --> 00:49:02,110
therapy and can occur
with most antibiotic

800
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:04,410
therapy, depending
on the dose and

801
00:49:04,410 --> 00:49:07,390
frequency and the
duration of therapy.

802
00:49:07,390 --> 00:49:09,430
Nausea, vomiting,
the drugs can

803
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:12,050
cause discomfort
in the stomach.

804
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:13,630
I talked about
C. difficile

805
00:49:13,630 --> 00:49:15,750
secondary
infection before.

806
00:49:16,470 --> 00:49:17,710
Candidiasis secondary

807
00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:19,830
infection or
yeast infection.

808
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:22,810
Oral thrush, vaginal
yeast infection.

809
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:25,770
These you do
need to know.

810
00:49:25,870 --> 00:49:29,430
IM injection, it's
kind of painful. Beta

811
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:32,510
-lactam injection
is into the muscle.

812
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:35,210
It needs to go
into a deep muscle

813
00:49:36,490 --> 00:49:40,410
injection into the
buttocks. It's painful.

814
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:43,830
IV injection,
again, it's going to

815
00:49:43,830 --> 00:49:45,690
be irritating to
the tissues, and it

816
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:49,170
can cause some
vein inflammation,

817
00:49:50,470 --> 00:49:52,050
thrombophlebitis.

818
00:49:54,930 --> 00:49:58,270
this is a picture
of pseudomembranous

819
00:49:58,510 --> 00:50:00,690
colitis here on
the left hand side

820
00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:05,520
you can see the
yellow pseudomembranes

821
00:50:05,590 --> 00:50:08,390
on the wall of the
sigmoid colon that's

822
00:50:08,390 --> 00:50:11,810
because c difficile
produces toxins toxin

823
00:50:11,810 --> 00:50:16,730
a and toxin b which
are cytolytic and

824
00:50:16,730 --> 00:50:20,070
c difficile here by
electron microscope.

825
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:23,710
This is a gram
-positive rod,

826
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:28,110
spore forming,
and here it is

827
00:50:28,110 --> 00:50:30,190
growing on a
blood auger plate.

828
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:36,010
Picture of oral
candidiasis here

829
00:50:36,010 --> 00:50:38,710
on the tongue,
and a picture of

830
00:50:38,710 --> 00:50:44,370
phlebitis on the
arm of this patient.

831
00:50:44,970 --> 00:50:48,610
And arachnoiditis
is inflammation

832
00:50:48,610 --> 00:50:56,050
of the arachnoid
membranes, layers.

833
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,740
Pregnancy, well, we
always have to think

834
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:02,590
if I have a pregnant
patient, am I going to

835
00:51:02,590 --> 00:51:04,570
be able to give the
drug? And the great

836
00:51:04,570 --> 00:51:07,470
thing about the beta
-lactams is it's generally

837
00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:09,590
compatible with
pregnancy. No evidence

838
00:51:09,590 --> 00:51:14,110
of impaired fertility,
of fetal harm, and

839
00:51:15,090 --> 00:51:18,230
the mother is not at
increased risk for

840
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:21,870
adverse events, and
neither is the fetus.

841
00:51:22,210 --> 00:51:23,450
Lactation, it may be

842
00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:24,950
excreted in breast milk.

843
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,010
When that happens,
we have to think

844
00:51:27,010 --> 00:51:30,230
about the baby taking
in antibiotic during

845
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:34,230
nursing, and that could
cause modifications

846
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:36,770
in the bowel
flora. So diarrhea,

847
00:51:36,930 --> 00:51:38,710
just from getting the

848
00:51:38,710 --> 00:51:40,850
antibiotic in
the breast milk.

849
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,030
For pediatrics, we
also have to think

850
00:51:48,030 --> 00:51:50,930
about, are there
recommendations

851
00:51:50,930 --> 00:51:54,390
for dosing in the
pediatric patient?

852
00:51:54,390 --> 00:51:57,970
Pediatric patients
are not little adults.

853
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:00,380
They have their
own pharmacokinetic

854
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:03,390
profiles. So we
need to have the

855
00:52:03,390 --> 00:52:06,770
information in order
to safely administer

856
00:52:06,770 --> 00:52:09,670
the drugs to infants
and children.

857
00:52:09,890 --> 00:52:13,710
And fortunately,
most of the beta

858
00:52:13,710 --> 00:52:15,610
-lactams are safe
for neonates.

859
00:52:17,030 --> 00:52:18,290
Takeaway.

860
00:52:20,990 --> 00:52:22,250
Takeaway.

861
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:24,250
Please remember,

862
00:52:24,530 --> 00:52:27,260
neonates have
immature functions.

863
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:30,060
Functions. Immature
renal function in

864
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:33,010
relation to the beta
-lactams because the

865
00:52:33,010 --> 00:52:35,140
beta-lactams are
excreted unchanged.

866
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:39,800
They also have immature
liver functions.

867
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:44,600
Immature drug
metabolizing functions.

868
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:49,300
drug interactions.

869
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:51,880
I'm just going to focus

870
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:53,380
on a couple of them.

871
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:57,160
Probenicid is
actually used in

872
00:52:57,160 --> 00:53:00,780
combination for
a beneficial

873
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:06,500
drug interaction
with penicillin.

874
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,320
Penicillin G.

875
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,680
Because it inhibits
the organic anion

876
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:16,680
transporter in the
proximal tubule that will

877
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:22,960
block or I should say
slow the secretion

878
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,840
of the beta-lactam
through that organic

879
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:29,560
anion transporter that
will in turn increase

880
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:32,180
plasma levels and
duration of therapy.

881
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:35,860
Not widely used, but
it is sometimes used.

882
00:53:37,010 --> 00:53:40,600
Penicillin G is
really short-acting.

883
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:46,700
Methotrexate is used in
rheumatoid arthritis.

884
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:49,360
It's also a cancer
drug, and it's highly

885
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:51,620
toxic with a narrow
therapeutic window.

886
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:53,160
Warfarin,

887
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:56,240
commonly used
anticoagulant,

888
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,800
less commonly than
it used to be,

889
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,300
but it's still
commonly used.

890
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:02,240
So anticoagulants,
think bleeding.

891
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:05,540
But I'm not going to
ask you to remember

892
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:08,580
warfarin or mesotrexate.
I am asking you

893
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:10,680
to remember probenicid
because it's used

894
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:13,220
together with the
penicillin. I want you

895
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:16,580
to remember about
hormonal contraception

896
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:21,480
because estrogen
undergoes

897
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:25,570
enterohepatic
circulation. It gets

898
00:54:25,570 --> 00:54:28,540
a glucuronide
in the liver,

899
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:32,560
enterohepatic circulation,
travels through

900
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:35,680
the gut, that beta
-lactam, sorry, the

901
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:40,820
glucuronide is cleaved
by gut bacteria and

902
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:44,480
the estrogen gets
reabsorbed. So if we are

903
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:48,400
killing gut bacteria,
including those that

904
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:51,280
cleave the beta-lac,
I keep saying that,

905
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:54,480
cleave the
glucuronide off of the

906
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:59,400
estrogen, then that's
not going to happen.

907
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:03,280
The estrogen will not
be reabsorbed. that

908
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:08,060
will decrease estrogen
levels that can

909
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:13,380
decrease oral contraceptive
efficacy and that

910
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:17,040
may increase pregnancy
risk now studies

911
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,020
have shown that this
is not such a big

912
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:22,180
deal as one would think
but it occurs to me

913
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:26,480
that if even one
person becomes pregnant

914
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:29,860
who didn't wish to be
pregnant because of

915
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:32,480
the antibiotic therapy
and because we didn't

916
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:37,040
caution that patient
then shame on us.

917
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:44,540
Proton pump inhibitors
increase the risk

918
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:46,340
of C difficile I'm
not going to ask

919
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:48,480
you to memorize that
for right now but you

920
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:50,420
will need to know
that at some point.

921
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:53,520
Tetracyclines this
is another antibiotic

922
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:56,820
and it has been shown
to decrease penicillin

923
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:59,180
efficacy when used
together with it.

924
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:03,720
And any kind of
vaccine that's live

925
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:06,380
attenuated bacteria,
well, an antibiotic

926
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:08,240
is going to
inactivate it. So

927
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,060
the ones I want
you to remember are

928
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:12,440
probenicid, you can
put a star on it,

929
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:15,740
the oral
contraceptives, and

930
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:18,320
tetracycline. So
put a star on those.

931
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:27,760
So check your knowledge.

932
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:31,020
This is a list.
But in the interest

933
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:33,820
of time, I'm not
going to go over

934
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:36,240
these questions. I
suggest you pause

935
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:38,660
your computer and
see if you can

936
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:41,980
remember the answers
without looking.

937
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:46,080
I have a list at
the very end of the

938
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:50,300
PowerPoint that has
the answers on it.

939
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:54,600
So let's talk about
beta-lactamases. I'm

940
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:57,060
going to start with
these because we have

941
00:56:57,060 --> 00:56:59,700
drugs that inhibit
the beta-lactamases.

942
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:02,940
And these drugs are
used with a variety

943
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:05,860
of different beta
-lactam drugs. So it's

944
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:08,460
helpful to have the
information in advance.

945
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:11,740
So this Ambler
classification scheme,

946
00:57:11,740 --> 00:57:13,820
it's not the only
way to do it,

947
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:19,440
classifies them
as A, B, C, and D.

948
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:25,860
The class A are
called, I should say

949
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:28,400
that beta-lactamases
within the class

950
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:31,180
A are called the
extended-spectrum beta

951
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:34,660
-lactamases, ESBLs,
highly prevalent.

952
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:39,340
They derive from
the TEM, SHV,

953
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:43,360
and CTX-M, and
they are resistant

954
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:45,040
to most of the
beta-lactamases.

955
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:47,200
I'm sorry, beta
-lactam drugs,

956
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:48,500
so how important is that?

957
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:53,500
And then the KPC
carbapenemase, well,

958
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:56,960
carbapenems are our
powerhouse, beta-lactams.

959
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:00,760
And if we lose their
activity because of

960
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:03,540
these beta-lactamases
expressed by

961
00:58:03,630 --> 00:58:08,620
Klebsiella, this is
Klebsiella pneumoniae

962
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:14,480
carbapenemase, then we
lose the whole group.

963
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:16,500
And this is such an

964
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:17,940
important class of drugs.

965
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:22,300
Now, our beta-lactamase
inhibitors, hurrah,

966
00:58:22,450 --> 00:58:26,200
prevent the actions
of these beta

967
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:28,340
-lactamases, or at least
most of them, anyway.

968
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:35,180
I have A, C, and
D on this list, in

969
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:37,040
this order, because
these are all these

970
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:38,960
so-called serine
beta-lactamases.

971
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:44,320
I am focusing on
the class A and

972
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:46,740
class C, because
these are prevalent.

973
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:49,620
Class C is called AMP-C.

974
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:50,680
That's the one I want

975
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:52,580
you to remember. AMP-C,

976
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:55,560
of course, the ESBLs,

977
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:59,240
these guys, and the KPCs.

978
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:04,820
Because the
organisms that

979
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:06,500
express AMP-C
beta-lactamases

980
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:12,760
are resistant to
such a number of beta

981
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:15,700
-lactam antibiotics.
So these are multi

982
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:22,440
-drug resistant, and
that's called MDR.

983
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:27,320
Now, class B, I'm
also focusing on.

984
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:30,740
They have a zinc
in them, so they're

985
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:33,620
metallobeta
-lactamases. These are

986
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:36,620
not inhibited by
beta-lactamase

987
00:59:36,620 --> 00:59:38,340
inhibitors. That's
the takeaway. Anyway,

988
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:41,480
class B metallobeta
-lactamases

989
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:45,260
expressed by a number
of gram-negative

990
00:59:45,260 --> 00:59:52,820
bacilli are just
resistant to

991
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:55,040
beta-lactams. The
end of the story.

992
00:59:56,240 --> 01:00:02,840
So class A, class C,
amp C, and metallos.

993
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:07,360
so see the
pattern get the

994
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:09,240
basics look for
the patterns

995
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:14,660
these are the beta
-lactamase inhibitors

996
01:00:14,660 --> 01:00:16,980
these three have been
around for a long time

997
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:20,400
these are the most
recent additions

998
01:00:24,550 --> 01:00:26,420
and I have stars
on all of them

999
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:28,240
because they're
that important

1000
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:34,160
the original ones
have a beta-lactam

1001
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:36,260
structure these
are irreversible

1002
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:41,040
see how similar it
is and these are

1003
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:42,980
reversible and they
don't have a beta

1004
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:45,900
-lactam structure
and they're potent

1005
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:51,820
and the AI came
up with a mnemonic

1006
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:53,980
device if you
care to use it

1007
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:00,320
The antibacterial
spectrum is

1008
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:03,140
determined by the beta
-lactam antibiotic,

1009
01:01:03,180 --> 01:01:05,820
not the beta
-lactamase inhibitor.

1010
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:10,720
If an organism
would be susceptible

1011
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:13,380
in the ideal world of

1012
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:17,060
susceptibility to
a particular drug,

1013
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:21,300
and now isn't because
of beta-lactamase

1014
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:24,760
expression, then
the beta-lactamase

1015
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:29,020
inhibitor will return
the activity to the beta

1016
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:32,000
-lactam. But if it
never was effective

1017
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,120
in the first place,
the beta-lactamase

1018
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:37,160
inhibitor won't allow
it to be effective.

1019
01:01:38,380 --> 01:01:42,770
Beta-lactamase inhibitors
have weak antibacterial

1020
01:01:42,770 --> 01:01:45,020
activity on their
own, virtually useless

1021
01:01:45,020 --> 01:01:47,540
as an antibacterial
with one exception.

1022
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:50,600
And I put the exception
down here. You do

1023
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:54,260
not need to memorize
this. This is just

1024
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:58,220
information for context.
It will come up at some

1025
01:01:58,220 --> 01:02:00,020
point in the future,
and you should know

1026
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:02,860
it then, but you don't
need to know it now.

1027
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:11,960
So the original
three clavulanic

1028
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:14,960
acid, solbactin, and
tazabactin inhibit

1029
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:17,620
Hambler class A
beta-lactamases.

1030
01:02:18,820 --> 01:02:21,600
So that includes
those ESBLs.

1031
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:28,820
and the second
group, the avibactum,

1032
01:02:28,820 --> 01:02:31,200
vabrabactum, relabactum,
and duralabactum,

1033
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:35,160
are potent and
reversible.

1034
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:38,440
They are reversible,
but they're so potent

1035
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:40,460
they really hang
on for a long time.

1036
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:44,760
And these inhibit
class A and class C.

1037
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:47,140
All right, so I have a

1038
01:02:47,140 --> 01:02:48,780
chart here to help you.

1039
01:02:49,060 --> 01:02:51,980
The irreversible
are on the top.

1040
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:54,680
Well, basically, they
all inhibit class

1041
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:56,340
A. That's what you
need to remember.

1042
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:59,420
The original three don't

1043
01:02:59,420 --> 01:03:00,760
inhibit anything else.

1044
01:03:01,310 --> 01:03:03,760
None of them inhibits the

1045
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:05,220
class B
metallobatolactamases.

1046
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:07,440
You see the pattern?

1047
01:03:08,020 --> 01:03:10,580
And then the
second group,

1048
01:03:10,580 --> 01:03:12,880
the potent
reversible types,

1049
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:16,680
inhibit a good
percentage of the

1050
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:19,580
KPC carbapenemases.
Thank goodness.

1051
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:23,480
So we get the
activity of the drugs

1052
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:28,000
back by adding one
of these malactamase

1053
01:03:28,340 --> 01:03:31,280
inhibitors to the
therapy. And then a

1054
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:33,960
couple of them also
are effective against

1055
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:36,000
class D. I don't
want to get involved

1056
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,920
with that right
now. It's important

1057
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:41,760
but you have enough
to know for now.

1058
01:03:45,460 --> 01:03:47,980
Here are some
questions. I invite you

1059
01:03:47,980 --> 01:03:49,400
to pause the video
and think about

1060
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:51,660
them. I'm not going
to go over them

1061
01:03:51,660 --> 01:03:54,680
in the interest of
time and the answers

1062
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:56,940
are at the end of
this PowerPoint.

1063
01:03:58,630 --> 01:03:59,870
Let's take a look at the

1064
01:03:59,870 --> 01:04:02,400
penicillins class.
These are the

1065
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:04,540
natural penicillins,
penicillin G,

1066
01:04:04,820 --> 01:04:08,460
the penicillinase
resistant penicillins,

1067
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:11,880
the amino
penicillins, and the

1068
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:15,960
antepseudomonal
penicillins. So these groups

1069
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:20,680
are also called
extended spectrum.

1070
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:30,380
And these are
narrow spectrum.

1071
01:04:30,380 --> 01:04:32,320
And we'll see
why in a moment.

1072
01:04:38,990 --> 01:04:41,550
Natural penicillins,
this is their

1073
01:04:41,550 --> 01:04:43,570
spectrum of
activity. This is

1074
01:04:43,570 --> 01:04:45,210
the spectrum of
activity of the

1075
01:04:45,210 --> 01:04:48,310
penicillinase
-resistant penicillins.

1076
01:04:48,310 --> 01:04:50,350
This is the
spectrum of activity

1077
01:04:50,350 --> 01:04:52,010
of the
aminopenicillins and

1078
01:04:52,010 --> 01:04:54,010
the antepseudamonal
penicillins.

1079
01:04:55,110 --> 01:04:57,690
So let's look at
them one by one.

1080
01:04:58,370 --> 01:05:01,530
So the penicillins
are a narrow spectrum

1081
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:08,730
of action. And I've
put a gray box over the

1082
01:05:08,730 --> 01:05:13,950
organisms that are
not susceptible to

1083
01:05:13,950 --> 01:05:17,610
penicillin. So let's look
at what is susceptible

1084
01:05:17,610 --> 01:05:20,510
and see why penicillin
is considered

1085
01:05:20,510 --> 01:05:25,870
narrow spectrum. So,
gram-positive, all good,

1086
01:05:26,090 --> 01:05:27,490
generally,

1087
01:05:28,510 --> 01:05:30,610
and spirochetes, gram

1088
01:05:30,610 --> 01:05:33,070
-positive and spirochetes.

1089
01:05:33,140 --> 01:05:34,090
Ah,

1090
01:05:34,290 --> 01:05:38,830
one gram-negative,
the one that causes

1091
01:05:38,830 --> 01:05:41,730
meningitis, Neisseria
meningitidis.

1092
01:05:44,170 --> 01:05:47,690
Naturally, C. difficile
is not susceptible.

1093
01:05:47,690 --> 01:05:52,750
The double line
through these means

1094
01:05:52,750 --> 01:05:57,110
they have been
susceptible at one time.

1095
01:05:57,990 --> 01:05:59,650
Staphylococcus now,

1096
01:05:59,770 --> 01:06:03,730
virtually all of them
express penicillinase,

1097
01:06:03,730 --> 01:06:05,690
so they're no
longer susceptible.

1098
01:06:07,310 --> 01:06:11,190
And Enterococcus
faecium is a pretty

1099
01:06:11,190 --> 01:06:14,270
difficult bug to
treat, period.

1100
01:06:17,770 --> 01:06:19,090
Enterococcus, penicillin

1101
01:06:19,090 --> 01:06:22,350
is actually
bacteriostatic.

1102
01:06:23,090 --> 01:06:26,990
So I said these are
bactericidal drugs

1103
01:06:26,990 --> 01:06:29,890
most of the time.
This is an exception.

1104
01:06:30,830 --> 01:06:32,910
So that's it, a
narrow spectrum.

1105
01:06:33,130 --> 01:06:34,790
Gram positive, good.

1106
01:06:36,290 --> 01:06:38,450
Spirochetes,
treponema paladin,

1107
01:06:38,450 --> 01:06:40,430
what are we thinking
of here? ********.

1108
01:06:40,430 --> 01:06:45,930
So ********, good,
and Neisseria

1109
01:06:45,930 --> 01:06:48,070
meningitidis,
meningitis, good.

1110
01:06:48,250 --> 01:06:49,490
That's it.

1111
01:06:54,590 --> 01:06:56,750
Pharmacokinetics,
what I want to point

1112
01:06:56,750 --> 01:07:01,030
out right here is
Pen-G is IV and IM.

1113
01:07:01,030 --> 01:07:03,470
It has really poor
oral absorption.

1114
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:06,150
Penicillin V is
oral only, and it

1115
01:07:06,150 --> 01:07:09,470
was formed from
penicillin G to

1116
01:07:09,470 --> 01:07:11,850
be more acid-stable.
You still have

1117
01:07:11,850 --> 01:07:13,410
to take it on an
empty stomach.

1118
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:16,220
And then we have
this repository

1119
01:07:16,350 --> 01:07:19,430
intramuscular injection.

1120
01:07:21,950 --> 01:07:25,630
And the long-acting
one, which is

1121
01:07:25,630 --> 01:07:28,540
what we see here,
is for ********.

1122
01:07:29,330 --> 01:07:34,890
one dose will last
two to three weeks so

1123
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:45,460
i mentioned before
staph aureus expresses

1124
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:48,640
penicillinase gram
negative bacilli express

1125
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:52,480
various beta-lactamases
plus penicillin

1126
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:56,560
can't pass through the
porins streptococcus

1127
01:07:59,370 --> 01:08:02,770
pneumoniae i do want
you to know these has

1128
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:05,440
an alteration in the
penicillin-binding

1129
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:09,280
protein. Methicillin
-resistant, same thing.

1130
01:08:09,340 --> 01:08:11,520
Enterococcus
faecium, same thing.

1131
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:14,500
Also, Enterococcus
faecalis to some extent.

1132
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:18,960
So, Streptococcus
pneumoniae,

1133
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:20,100
MRSA,

1134
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:23,140
Enterococcus, PBP.

1135
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:26,020
If there is a
PBP alteration,

1136
01:08:26,020 --> 01:08:28,100
target alteration,

1137
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:30,720
then no beta-lactam
is going to work.

1138
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:33,900
Of course, there
are exceptions.

1139
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:39,250
Intrinsic resistance,
gram-negative, because

1140
01:08:39,250 --> 01:08:41,800
the penicillins can't
pass through, with

1141
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:44,380
the exception of the
Neisserium energiditis.

1142
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:49,520
Hypersensitivity
reactions,

1143
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:50,840
we talked about that.

1144
01:08:51,020 --> 01:08:54,280
Penicillins are
also CNS irritants.

1145
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:56,300
They can cause
seizures in high doses.

1146
01:08:56,720 --> 01:09:00,520
So penicillin does
not readily cross

1147
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:02,960
the blood-brain
barrier. except when

1148
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:06,800
the meninges are
inflamed. So seizures

1149
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:08,920
is not going to be
normally a problem.

1150
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:13,260
Electrolyte
disturbance is not from

1151
01:09:13,260 --> 01:09:15,800
the penicillin, but
because it's formulated

1152
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:18,120
with sodium and
potassium salts.

1153
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:20,220
And because the drug
has a short half

1154
01:09:20,220 --> 01:09:22,180
-life and it's given
many times during

1155
01:09:22,180 --> 01:09:24,520
the day, even by
continuous infusion,

1156
01:09:25,140 --> 01:09:28,780
then the patient can
be receiving quite

1157
01:09:28,780 --> 01:09:32,060
a bit of sodium and
or potassium. So

1158
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:34,140
the electrolytes
have to be watched.

1159
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:37,640
And this Jarish
-Herxheimer reaction, this

1160
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:40,960
is ********. The boards
love this question.

1161
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:44,940
Penicillin is
really effective

1162
01:09:44,940 --> 01:09:47,000
against treponema
paladin,

1163
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,920
and the treatment
is ********.

1164
01:09:49,420 --> 01:09:52,420
And these
spirochetes die, and

1165
01:09:52,420 --> 01:09:53,960
they draw an
immune reaction.

1166
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:56,880
So it's an acute
self-limited febrile

1167
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:58,700
reaction because
of the antibiotic

1168
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:01,460
treatment and the
exposure of the immune

1169
01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:04,070
system to these
dying spirochetes.

1170
01:10:07,540 --> 01:10:09,940
Now let's take a look
at the second group.

1171
01:10:09,940 --> 01:10:11,740
This is the second
group to have been

1172
01:10:11,740 --> 01:10:15,200
developed. I mentioned
that Staphylococcus

1173
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:17,960
aureus rapidly
developed penicillinase

1174
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:20,720
and was therefore
resistant to penicillin

1175
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:23,640
G. So what do we
do? Ah, we need to

1176
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:26,600
develop drugs that are
going to be effective

1177
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:30,140
against that penicillin
-age-producing

1178
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:33,560
organism. And we have
three of them now.

1179
01:10:34,620 --> 01:10:37,140
Methicillin was
the first one

1180
01:10:37,140 --> 01:10:39,620
in this group
to be developed.

1181
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:42,660
Hence, we hear
about methicillin

1182
01:10:42,660 --> 01:10:44,800
-sensitive, staph aureus,

1183
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:47,440
methicillin-resistant,
staph aureus.

1184
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:49,480
Methicillin is no
longer available.

1185
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:52,160
It was just drawn
decades ago.

1186
01:10:52,180 --> 01:10:55,800
because it caused
a relatively high

1187
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:57,960
incidence of
interstitial nephritis.

1188
01:10:58,250 --> 01:11:00,040
But these other ones

1189
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:01,680
were developed instead,

1190
01:11:02,450 --> 01:11:05,400
and they are used
to treat methicillin

1191
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:09,000
-sensitive
Staphylococcus aureus,

1192
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,980
or Staphylococcus
epidermidis.

1193
01:11:15,340 --> 01:11:17,920
Oxacillin is
actually oral,

1194
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:21,620
but dicloxacillin
is used far more

1195
01:11:21,620 --> 01:11:23,880
frequently because of
better absorption so

1196
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:32,140
here's the spectrum
of activity nearly

1197
01:11:32,140 --> 01:11:35,920
everything is blocked
out so what isn't blocked

1198
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:40,250
out the gram positive
cocci streptococcus

1199
01:11:40,250 --> 01:11:45,280
group a methicillin
sensitive staph aureus

1200
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:52,080
and methicillin sensitive
staph epidermidis

1201
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:55,580
now if a patient has
these infections and

1202
01:11:55,580 --> 01:11:57,020
that a different drug
is going to be used

1203
01:11:57,020 --> 01:12:00,620
because they're more
effective than this one

1204
01:12:00,620 --> 01:12:04,400
so basically the
spectrum of activity is

1205
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:09,960
this that's pretty
narrow spectrum if the

1206
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:14,070
methicillin I'm sorry
if the staphylococcus

1207
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:18,640
expresses resistance
by altered penicillin

1208
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:21,960
binding proteins these
drugs will not work.

1209
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:28,830
Now the difference
in pharmacokinetics

1210
01:12:29,430 --> 01:12:34,460
compared to the class
effects is hepatic

1211
01:12:34,460 --> 01:12:38,080
elimination, non
-renal elimination.

1212
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:41,700
So no dosage
adjustment is necessary

1213
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:43,700
for renal impairment
with these drugs.

1214
01:12:45,100 --> 01:12:47,700
I mentioned the activity.

1215
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:52,500
MSSA, yes. MRSA, no.

1216
01:12:53,540 --> 01:12:56,660
The penicillin
-binding protein 2A

1217
01:12:56,660 --> 01:12:59,340
expressed by MEK-A
gene has very low

1218
01:12:59,340 --> 01:13:01,920
affinity for beta
-lactams. The boards

1219
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:04,420
love this piece
of information.

1220
01:13:06,660 --> 01:13:08,320
Therapeutic use.

1221
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:11,920
Methicillin
-sensitive staph.

1222
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:15,820
Adverse effects. They
could cause hepatitis.

1223
01:13:15,820 --> 01:13:19,020
Remember, they're
excreted via the liver.

1224
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:22,920
And this acute
interstitial nephritis

1225
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:26,040
that methicillin was
associated with occurs

1226
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:28,080
really only rarely
with these drugs.

1227
01:13:28,170 --> 01:13:30,580
Doesn't mean we
don't watch for it.

1228
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:36,040
Now the extended
spectrum penicillins, a

1229
01:13:36,040 --> 01:13:39,700
very, very important
group of drugs. These

1230
01:13:39,700 --> 01:13:43,140
are the aminopenicillins.
And their

1231
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:48,480
structure was developed
so that they can

1232
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:53,180
actually pass through
the porins and get to

1233
01:13:53,180 --> 01:13:58,420
the PBPs within gram
-negative organisms. So

1234
01:13:58,420 --> 01:14:01,060
they have a much better
spectrum of activity

1235
01:14:01,060 --> 01:14:03,420
than we saw with
their predecessors.

1236
01:14:03,420 --> 01:14:07,130
They are also
combined with a beta

1237
01:14:07,130 --> 01:14:08,640
-lactamase inhibitor.
So they can

1238
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:11,300
be acquired either
with or without

1239
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:13,080
the beta-lactamase
inhibitors.

1240
01:14:16,260 --> 01:14:20,700
And way fewer
organisms are blocked

1241
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:22,280
out when we look
at the amino

1242
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:24,360
penicillin spectrum
of activity.

1243
01:14:24,380 --> 01:14:31,020
Again, the double
strike-through are

1244
01:14:31,020 --> 01:14:33,520
organisms that have
developed considerable

1245
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:35,820
resistance, but
the beta-lactamase

1246
01:14:35,820 --> 01:14:39,320
inhibitor returns
the susceptibility.

1247
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:47,880
Basically, that's
what I just said.

1248
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:49,480
So what is the
spectrum? Same as

1249
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:51,940
penicillin plus
some respiratory

1250
01:14:51,940 --> 01:14:54,080
pathogens, so those
are gram negatives,

1251
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:59,080
plus some aerobic gram
-negative bacteria,

1252
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:01,470
such as the gut bugs,
the enterobacteriales,

1253
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:07,300
and other gram
-negative bacteria.

1254
01:15:07,910 --> 01:15:10,080
What else do I
want to say here?

1255
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:16,320
Oh, Pseudomonas is
resistant. Pseudomonas

1256
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:20,160
is this little obligate
aerobe organism

1257
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:23,140
that can cause serious,
serious infection

1258
01:15:23,140 --> 01:15:25,920
in immunocompromised
people. People die

1259
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:28,360
from this. Ventilator
-associated pneumonia.

1260
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:31,700
Serious, complicated

1261
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:33,580
urinary tract infections.

1262
01:15:33,580 --> 01:15:34,820
And others.

1263
01:15:34,820 --> 01:15:36,120
Bacteremia.

1264
01:15:36,690 --> 01:15:39,030
and so we're not
going to be using

1265
01:15:39,030 --> 01:15:41,350
any of the drugs
we already saw

1266
01:15:41,350 --> 01:15:43,640
for the treatment
of Pseudomonas.

1267
01:15:49,020 --> 01:15:50,900
Something very
important to remember

1268
01:15:50,900 --> 01:15:54,160
about the aminopenicillins,
ampicillin, and

1269
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:56,940
amoxicillin is this
non-allergic rash.

1270
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:03,600
It's a maculopapular
rash on the trunk and

1271
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:05,420
it can spread to
the face. It usually

1272
01:16:05,420 --> 01:16:09,200
is delayed in appearance.
It doesn't appear

1273
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:13,120
for even up to a week
and in some cases

1274
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:15,600
even longer than that
a couple of weeks.

1275
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:19,760
And so what causes
it? Well it appears to

1276
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:24,660
be associated when
the amino penicillin

1277
01:16:24,660 --> 01:16:27,000
particularly amoxicillin
or ampicillin

1278
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:31,180
is given to a patient
who has a viral

1279
01:16:31,180 --> 01:16:36,520
infection such as
roseola, or mononucleosis.

1280
01:16:36,780 --> 01:16:40,020
So why are we
giving it to a

1281
01:16:40,020 --> 01:16:41,700
patient with a
viral infection? We

1282
01:16:41,700 --> 01:16:43,340
shouldn't be
doing that at all.

1283
01:16:43,740 --> 01:16:46,360
And there's a drug
interaction. When

1284
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:48,550
it's given to patients
who take allopurinol,

1285
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:52,060
allopurinol is
for gout, that

1286
01:16:53,300 --> 01:16:57,060
reaction can cause
this non-allergic rash.

1287
01:16:58,180 --> 01:17:01,980
That said, it can
also cause allergic

1288
01:17:01,980 --> 01:17:05,120
rashes. And these
usually occur rapidly.

1289
01:17:08,900 --> 01:17:11,680
Ampicillin, I am IV oral,

1290
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:13,900
amoxicillin oral only.

1291
01:17:13,900 --> 01:17:16,800
Chances are you've
had amoxicillin or

1292
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:19,780
amoxicillin clavulanate
when you were a

1293
01:17:19,780 --> 01:17:23,240
child for the
treatment of some upper

1294
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:25,920
respiratory infection
like otitis media.

1295
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:31,780
The drugs are
equivalent in spectrum.

1296
01:17:32,260 --> 01:17:34,580
The main difference
is that amoxicillin

1297
01:17:34,580 --> 01:17:37,640
has this great oral
bioavailability.

1298
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:42,380
As a result, compared
to oral ampicillin,

1299
01:17:42,380 --> 01:17:45,100
the plasma levels
are much higher.

1300
01:17:48,610 --> 01:17:51,860
Drug is not metabolized.
It's pretty typical

1301
01:17:51,860 --> 01:17:55,200
of the class beta
-lactam pharmacokinetics.

1302
01:17:55,260 --> 01:17:57,700
High concentrations
excreted

1303
01:17:57,700 --> 01:17:59,360
in urine, so it
would be good

1304
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:01,080
for urinary
tract infections.

1305
01:18:01,980 --> 01:18:05,000
unabsorbed oral
ampicillin will pass

1306
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,890
through the gut and
it will act on the

1307
01:18:07,890 --> 01:18:10,940
microbiota in the
gut and kill them. So

1308
01:18:10,940 --> 01:18:15,420
we can see C. difficile
associated diarrhea

1309
01:18:15,420 --> 01:18:17,180
in patients who
have C. difficile.

1310
01:18:17,690 --> 01:18:19,780
And it's got a
short half-life.

1311
01:18:22,180 --> 01:18:27,940
Okay now I mentioned
that the drugs we

1312
01:18:27,940 --> 01:18:30,860
had seen thus far are
not useful against

1313
01:18:30,860 --> 01:18:34,780
pseudomonas. Well,
this particular drug,

1314
01:18:34,910 --> 01:18:36,760
pipericillin
-tazobactam, which is the

1315
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:38,420
only one in this
group that's available

1316
01:18:38,420 --> 01:18:42,120
any longer, is effective
against pseudomonas.

1317
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:43,940
So it's got the
same spectrum of

1318
01:18:43,940 --> 01:18:51,340
action as the ampicillin,
but it includes

1319
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:53,820
pseudomonas
susceptibility.

1320
01:18:54,460 --> 01:18:56,780
It's called a
uretopenicillin. I'm

1321
01:18:56,780 --> 01:18:59,080
not asking you to
memorize that, but

1322
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:01,540
you will hear it
and you will see it.

1323
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:08,240
Now look at this
spectrum of action.

1324
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:11,840
You can see why it's
called, piperacillin

1325
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:15,880
tazabactam is
called the most

1326
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:19,620
powerful drug in the
penicillins class.

1327
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:23,040
It has the
greatest spectrum

1328
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:24,720
of activity. It's easy to

1329
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:26,400
remember what is
not susceptible,

1330
01:19:27,740 --> 01:19:30,360
then remembering
what is susceptible.

1331
01:19:36,530 --> 01:19:37,830
So the big takeaway is

1332
01:19:37,830 --> 01:19:39,750
pseudomonas and
broad spectrum.

1333
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:42,290
Therapeutic use is a wide

1334
01:19:42,290 --> 01:19:45,410
gamut of serious
infections.

1335
01:19:45,790 --> 01:19:49,890
It also has
sodium salt in

1336
01:19:49,890 --> 01:19:51,310
it and a short half-life.

1337
01:19:51,550 --> 01:19:54,150
It can cause some
bleeding disorders,

1338
01:19:54,270 --> 01:19:56,270
seizure disorders,
just like

1339
01:19:56,270 --> 01:19:58,290
penicillin, with
the high doses,

1340
01:19:58,290 --> 01:20:00,410
and patients with
renal impairment,

1341
01:20:00,890 --> 01:20:04,530
because then the plasma
levels are higher.

1342
01:20:04,970 --> 01:20:07,050
Leukopenia,
not neutropenia

1343
01:20:07,050 --> 01:20:08,270
with long-term use.

1344
01:20:09,230 --> 01:20:11,150
And some more questions.

1345
01:20:11,180 --> 01:20:14,250
Again, I won't go
over them. The answers

1346
01:20:14,250 --> 01:20:16,530
are at the end.
I encourage you

1347
01:20:16,530 --> 01:20:18,690
to pause the video
and see if you can

1348
01:20:18,690 --> 01:20:20,550
remember the answers
without looking.

1349
01:20:22,870 --> 01:20:26,410
And a summary,
very quickly.

1350
01:20:27,030 --> 01:20:28,810
Beta-lactam ring for

1351
01:20:28,810 --> 01:20:31,930
activity. PBPs
is the target.

1352
01:20:32,590 --> 01:20:35,050
PBP is caused a
cross-linking.

1353
01:20:35,350 --> 01:20:38,170
Bacterial autolysins
are triggered causing

1354
01:20:38,170 --> 01:20:40,370
osmotic rupture of
the cell and non-lytic

1355
01:20:40,370 --> 01:20:42,470
mechanisms are
probably also involved.

1356
01:20:43,110 --> 01:20:46,710
The organisms must
be synthesizing cell

1357
01:20:46,710 --> 01:20:49,040
walls so they need
to be proliferating.

1358
01:20:50,390 --> 01:20:53,090
The antibacterial
spectrum is determined

1359
01:20:53,090 --> 01:20:56,870
by the drug's ability
to access the PBPs.

1360
01:20:56,870 --> 01:21:00,890
So penicillins can't
get through the porins

1361
01:21:00,890 --> 01:21:03,250
so they don't access
them with the one

1362
01:21:03,250 --> 01:21:06,490
exception, Neisseria
meningitidis. And

1363
01:21:06,490 --> 01:21:10,710
through the list we
see greater activity

1364
01:21:10,710 --> 01:21:14,150
based on the structures
and the ability of

1365
01:21:14,150 --> 01:21:16,770
the extended spectrum
penicillins to reach

1366
01:21:16,770 --> 01:21:21,050
the target in gram
-negative organisms.

1367
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:27,030
I'm not going to
go over this. I

1368
01:21:27,030 --> 01:21:29,370
encourage you to
read it on your own.

1369
01:21:31,270 --> 01:21:35,170
This just is a review
of the spectrums of

1370
01:21:35,170 --> 01:21:38,430
activity of the various
penicillins group.

1371
01:21:40,370 --> 01:21:43,850
And our beta-lactamase
inhibitor is the

1372
01:21:43,850 --> 01:21:46,970
clavulanic acid,
sulbactin, tazobactin,

1373
01:21:46,970 --> 01:21:49,730
irreversible group,
the early group,

1374
01:21:49,850 --> 01:21:52,850
avibactin, relabactin,
fabrobactin. Drillabactin

1375
01:21:52,850 --> 01:21:54,730
are the potent
reversible inhibitors

1376
01:21:54,730 --> 01:21:58,370
that were developed a
little sometime later.

1377
01:21:59,130 --> 01:22:03,730
And the Ambler
classification,

1378
01:22:04,070 --> 01:22:07,190
the drugs that I
want, the bugs I

1379
01:22:07,190 --> 01:22:09,590
want you to know
by name, and the

1380
01:22:09,590 --> 01:22:12,280
biolactamase inhibitors
that are useful

1381
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:15,030
in returning the
activity of the drug

1382
01:22:15,030 --> 01:22:20,010
to fight against
these infections.

1383
01:22:21,390 --> 01:22:23,870
And here are the answers,

1384
01:22:26,380 --> 01:22:32,810
and this is a nice
picture, and our

1385
01:22:32,810 --> 01:22:34,770
references. And that
That concludes part

1386
01:22:34,770 --> 01:22:39,130
one of the beta
-lactam antibiotics.
