00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,500
Hello again, this
is Maria Plummer,

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,900
and this topic
is inflammation.

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,240
It is a little bit
complicated. Some of

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,820
you may have some
background knowledge

5
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,700
and may have heard
some of these things,

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,140
and I'm into
repetition. I believe

7
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:21,220
repetition helps, so
we will go over things,

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,640
and I will lead you
through the important

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,740
topics. I also wanna
say one thing. I do

10
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:29,720
a lot of bolding and
putting things in

11
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,740
red, and I do that for
guidance, But also,

12
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,480
I do not want people
to not notice the

13
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,120
things that are not
in bold or read, okay?

14
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,540
So please take
everything into

15
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,220
consideration, and
I'll tell you when

16
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:43,880
to get more detailed
and when you

17
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,360
don't need to be
more detailed.

18
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,640
So here are the session

19
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,560
objectives, which
are the same or

20
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,280
should be the
same on the CPG.

21
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:52,360
And here is kind
of the way we're

22
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,680
going to go with
this inflammation,

23
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,110
kind of a map of how
things happen. It

24
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:00,540
starts with acute
inflammation, and you can

25
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:04,540
use this if you would
like as we go along.

26
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,520
Also, you may want
to pause this session

27
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,560
halfway through just
to get a break here.

28
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,640
So inflammation in
general is a response

29
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,180
to cell injury. We
discussed cell injury,

30
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,420
and it's an early and
a transient response.

31
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,860
Why does inflammation
happen? Because

32
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,320
you need to eliminate
that cause of the

33
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,220
cell injury, localize
it, eliminate it,

34
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,700
restore the tissue,
whether that be a

35
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:32,060
bacterial infection,
a cut, or whatever.

36
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,520
There's going to be
a lot of chemical

37
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,560
mediators involved
and changes in the

38
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,260
vasculature and white
blood cell responses.

39
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,600
Again, when we
talk about cute, we

40
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,880
usually mean fast,
minute, hours,

41
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,720
those neutrophils.
In this case, chronic

42
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,960
would be slower,
days or longer,

43
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,760
things like monocytes
and macrophages and

44
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,640
lymphocytes. Monocytes,
by the way, are the

45
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,960
same thing as
macrophages but monocytes

46
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,540
are what we call them in
the blood's peripheral

47
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,460
blood and macrophages
what you call

48
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,460
them in tissue when
you see the word itis

49
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,520
afterward we usually
are talking about some

50
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,480
kind of inflammatory
process in the old

51
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,740
days latin ruled i happen
to like latin a lot

52
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,780
and um the cardinal
signs were considered

53
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,660
are still considered
rubor calor tumor

54
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:22,920
and the fifth one was
added later, functional

55
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,700
lysae. So basically
you all know this,

56
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,600
you know, when you get
a wound there's going

57
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,260
to be redness, warmth,
swelling, or edema,

58
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:33,040
and pain. And if it's
really bad you will

59
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,420
lose function of
whatever that part is.

60
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,820
What causes inflammation?
We went through,

61
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,060
you know, inflammation
is not always infection,

62
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,400
but infection
certainly can cause

63
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,400
inflammation. It's number
one on this list. But

64
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,920
also immune reaction
tissue necrosis, when we

65
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,220
talk about myocardial
infarction at some

66
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:54,000
point you will see that
necrosis will elicit

67
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,200
inflammation. Foreign
bodies, trauma, radiation

68
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,740
burns, and this is
not a complete list.

69
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So again as we
discuss cell

70
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,380
injury this
is a response.

71
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,260
Okay so here are some
pictures. There's a

72
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,120
cellulitis of this
person's foot it's

73
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,820
very swollen you can
tell that it's red if

74
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,820
you were to touch
yours probably be warm.

75
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:16,260
And the inflamed
tonsil next is also

76
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,860
very inflamed and
endematous and red.

77
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,640
And probably these
are painful as well.

78
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,900
So these are, in
these cases, this

79
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,120
inflammation and also
infection probably.

80
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:32,380
Here's an appendix on
the right bottom is

81
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,100
a normal one. And
on the left, this is

82
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,620
an inflamed appendix,
not bad actually,

83
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,500
but you can see the
red vessels on the

84
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,660
surface. So that's part
of the rubor or the

85
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,960
redness and it is
swollen it is swollen

86
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,870
so this is probably
an early appendicitis

87
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:53,860
so here's the overview
how does now we're

88
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,540
talking about acute
information at this point

89
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:58,560
we'll talk about chronic
afterwards um you

90
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,120
need a stimulus then
there's a bunch of

91
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,280
vascular things that
happen in a vessel then

92
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,440
the cellular events
which involve the white

93
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,660
cells then let's say
it's bacterial or

94
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:12,400
even necrosis, you
need phagocytosis, the

95
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,340
digesting of whatever
it is that's causing the

96
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,640
injury. And then the
acute inflammation has

97
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,840
to end or else you're
going to have more

98
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,500
damage. And we'll talk
about all this. And

99
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,360
the inflammatory response
involves a lot of

100
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,380
R's here. If you want
to think of it that

101
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:33,340
way, it has to recognize
that something did

102
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,740
happen that's injured.
The white blood cells

103
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,740
have to be recruited.
Most of the time,

104
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,480
that's the neutrophils
and the macrophages.

105
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,500
And whatever it is,
microbial agent needs

106
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,640
to, or whatever,
needs to be removed.

107
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,340
And the response itself
has to be regulated.

108
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,380
It can't just go crazy.
We all saw in COVID

109
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:54,860
how the immune system
can go very, very

110
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,520
crazy in the sense that
it just overdoes it and

111
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,620
can cause what is known
as a cytokine storm

112
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,640
and we'll get a little
bit into that later.

113
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,070
And of course resolution
which is really

114
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:10,980
repair that is the topic
of the next session.

115
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,800
So this is just some
physiology. I am not

116
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,200
a physiologist but
just some basic things.

117
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,180
You know hydrostatic
pressure is what

118
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,900
pushes fluid out
whereas osmotic pressure

119
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,940
also known as
oncotic keeps fluid

120
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,860
in and these are
just visuals showing

121
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,540
that and you need a
balance in that or

122
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,600
you're going to get
basically edema.

123
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:37,760
And as I said that
when the balance is

124
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:41,160
disrupted you will
get edema. Now if the

125
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,580
hydrostatic and oncotic
pressures are not

126
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,660
an equal immune you
usually get what's

127
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:49,020
known as a transidate.
A transidate is low

128
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,420
in protein there's
not a lot of cells

129
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,550
in it and it has a
low specific gravity.

130
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,400
That's going to be
different than an

131
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,640
exudate, which we'll
discuss in a little bit.

132
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,620
If the hydrostatic
pressure is increased,

133
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,280
then you get
localized edema,

134
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,240
and that is seen in
the x-ray on top.

135
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,740
That's, for example,
someone with congestive

136
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,180
heart failure.
Now, I don't expect

137
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,860
you to recognize it.
It's not the best

138
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,940
x-ray either, but it's
a little too white

139
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,880
and fluffy, especially
in the bottom.

140
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,920
There's water in
the lungs. There's

141
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,320
edema in the lungs,
pulmonary congestion.

142
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,800
And if the oncotic
pressures decrease like

143
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,800
in liver kidney disease
then you can get

144
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,000
generalized dema or
what's known as anisarka.

145
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,200
So in malnutrition
this poor baby here

146
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,320
has kwashiorka disease
which you don't have

147
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,220
to know but this
is severe protein

148
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,280
malnutrition that's
usually in children and

149
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,720
it's usually found in
very severe cases of

150
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,820
starvation and poverty
stricken reasons.

151
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:50,060
So the whole body is
edematous here. And

152
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:53,000
so again, I want
to repeat, edema is

153
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,440
excessive fluid in the
extravascular space,

154
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,430
and that would
be swelling

155
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,900
or tumor in the Latin.

156
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:04,760
Okay, now these steps
are artificial. It's

157
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,040
not like one step
happens, it stops, and the

158
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,840
other step, we're
going to go through a

159
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,260
couple steps here, but
this is just to simplify

160
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,140
it and not that it
would be step one,

161
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,980
step two. But first
of all, when something

162
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:20,380
happens you need to
get to that source. So

163
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:23,860
there's vasodilation and
this picture shows it

164
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,100
and the mechanism is
that there's some kind

165
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,940
of trigger and
histamine. Histamine is a

166
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:31,680
very important mediator
that relaxes the

167
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,640
vascular smooth muscle
and I already mentioned

168
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,500
that increased hydrostatic
pressure causes

169
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:40,260
a transnate and this
vasodilation because

170
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,420
the smooth muscle
relaxes and the vessels

171
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,220
are made of smooth
muscle in the wall that

172
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,460
will dilate the vessel
and you'll get more

173
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,880
blood flow and that
contributes to heat and

174
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,620
edema or rubor and cholor
which is not written

175
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:57,820
here so a little
word i'm going to do

176
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:00,900
little um sidetracks
because a lot of the terms

177
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:04,060
i use you may not or
you may know already

178
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:07,720
but i just want to
um make definitions

179
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:11,100
known so i just mentioned
histamine and these

180
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:15,080
are this is made and
stored in mast cells.

181
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:20,080
Physical trauma can
elicit it and it binds

182
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,080
antibodies to mast
cells. Those would be

183
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,860
allergic reactions.
It's also part of the

184
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:28,000
anaphylic toxins which
are proteins of the

185
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,900
complement system which
we'll talk about later

186
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:34,120
and histamine relaxes
the vascular muscle

187
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,780
so that means the
vessels will dilate. It

188
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:39,360
also increases vascular
permeability and

189
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,220
we're going to go through
this. The other one

190
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,280
that's kind of important
is nitric oxide

191
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,560
which is produced by
endothelial cells where

192
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,080
it's a dissolved gas
and it acts like a

193
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,740
signaling molecule and
it also relaxes vascular

194
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:55,080
smooth muscle thus
dilating the vessel.

195
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,440
Okay here's a nice
table from Robbins.

196
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,340
I don't believe in
memorization but in

197
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:04,380
usage so So just to
keep everything kind

198
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,240
of organized, this
puts all the things

199
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,960
we're going to talk
about in a table.

200
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,880
I don't want you to
memorize it, but you

201
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,520
need to know that
vasodilation, the main

202
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:17,300
mediators are histamine
and prostagladins,

203
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,100
and I also mentioned
nitric oxide, and

204
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,180
we'll talk about some
of these, and these

205
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,760
are all very important
information. So I

206
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,640
don't really want you
to memorize it, but I

207
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,540
do want you to be
familiar and know if I

208
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,700
say something what it
what category it may

209
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,870
be and a lot of these
by the way overlap

210
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:40,860
okay they do more than
one thing so let's

211
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,340
talk about vascular
permeability uh we're

212
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,740
talking about how
leaky the vessel is and

213
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:49,340
when the vessel becomes
leaky uh it's going

214
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,920
to affect the
hemodynamics so the more

215
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,960
leaky it is that's
because it's got increased

216
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,620
permeability and
you can get then an

217
00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:00,340
exudate. An exudate has
high cellular and protein

218
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,460
content as opposed
to the transudate we

219
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,980
spoke of in a high
specific gravity. An

220
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,340
example would be pus
or something or the

221
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:11,140
better way to say it
is purulent exudate and

222
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,620
it's full of white
blood cells, dead cell

223
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:16,720
debris, and many times
the microorganisms.

224
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,100
So again this is a
nice visual of what

225
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,860
can happen transudate
versus exudate.

226
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,080
I'm not going to go
through it bit by bit

227
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,060
but the point is that
you know the fat the

228
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,620
bigger the arrow the
thicker the arrow that

229
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,260
means there's increased
hydrostatic pressure in

230
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:38,220
B and you get a
transidate and we've been

231
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,500
through this low protein
low cellular content

232
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:44,900
if you have decreased
colloid osmotic pressure

233
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,580
also you would get a
transidate and then

234
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,940
the exidate what happens
is there's increased

235
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,660
vascular permeability.
As you can tell,

236
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,640
the endothelial cells
that are lining the

237
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,800
vessel on the bottom
have gaps in them now.

238
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,520
There's a thick arrow
through all of them for

239
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,020
them, and that means
things can leak out, and

240
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,460
that's what happens
to making the exudate.

241
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,980
So let's go to step two,

242
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,500
again an artificial step.

243
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:12,160
Once we have, you
know, dilated, then we

244
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,140
can, and again, this is
not like one stop and

245
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,980
then another. It just
kind of flows together.

246
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,820
vascular permeability
increase. The most

247
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,500
significant mechanism
behind that is histamine

248
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,980
again which retracts
the endothelial

249
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:27,360
cells so you get little
openings as you see in

250
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,200
this picture and that
would increase vascular

251
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,760
permeability so that
fluid and proteins

252
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,980
and cells can leak out
forming an exudate.

253
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:39,720
Okay so again
this is also other

254
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,000
things also
contribute to this but

255
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,700
I'm trying to simplify
it to recognize

256
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,120
the major players,
if you will.

257
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:50,920
This is an immediate and
a transient response,

258
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,860
15 to 30 minutes,
but nobody's going to

259
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:58,420
take a timer to it, but
around that. So what

260
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,780
you have these things
happening, vasodilation

261
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,900
permeability, and
that is going to lead

262
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:06,600
to, if you will, step
three of the vascular

263
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,060
changes. And that means
that blood flow is

264
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:13,280
going to be slower uh
like a like a garden

265
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,440
hose if you oh if you
have a bigger diameter

266
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,980
um and it gets permeable
you're going to

267
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:23,360
get uh slower moving
water so the blood flow

268
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,110
is slower and the word
for that is stasis

269
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:30,800
um and the mechanism is
as we've kind of said

270
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,540
already vasodilation
increasing the diameter

271
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,600
of the vessel because
it's now relaxed

272
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,280
um that's the hemodynamics
the transidation

273
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,240
which means decreased
fluid and higher

274
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,800
concentration of the
red blood cells so

275
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,840
you get the stasis
so the blood kind of

276
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:50,280
it's more red blood
cells and you lose fluid

277
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,440
as well with
permeability what happens

278
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,080
and this is important
is the accumulation

279
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,900
of white blood
cells especially

280
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,960
neutrophils and acute
inflammation along the

281
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,500
vascular epithelium
that should be

282
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,560
endothelium really not
epithelium but they get

283
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,700
displaced perfectly
and that is called

284
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,600
margination and this
is a picture of a

285
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,160
vessel a lot of red
blood cells in the middle

286
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,720
and if you can see
all around here on the

287
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,140
inside of the vessel
are blue little look

288
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:23,300
like squish dance as
one mentor told me

289
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:26,780
that's margination the
neutrophils marginate

290
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,360
I used to go on rounds
with an infectious

291
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,480
disease professor
who used to a doctor

292
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,880
who used to love to
say okay when we were

293
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,260
clogging up the
hallways around, she'd

294
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,710
say, make like a
neutrophil and marginate,

295
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:41,860
meaning get to the
edge of the wall

296
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:44,840
so people can move.
So that's one way to

297
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,690
think about it.
Now again, there is

298
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:49,720
overlap. As I said,
I've been talking about

299
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,040
histamine, nitric
oxide, which mediates

300
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,960
laser dilation,
increased blood flow,

301
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,100
and I am repeating
myself on purpose.

302
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:00,760
These things all
contribute to the redness,

303
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,600
the warmth, and
the swelling. The

304
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:07,140
pain also is because
the prostaglandins,

305
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:09,220
especially PGE2,
sensitives the nerve

306
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:12,240
endings to something
known as bradyokinin,

307
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,160
which does a lot
of things, not just

308
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,460
pain, but we burn
color as well. So let

309
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,060
me just take you
on a little trip to

310
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,820
bradyokinin, which are
vasoactive peptides.

311
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,300
Bradyokinin, as well
as prostaglandins

312
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:28,460
and histamine will
mediate vasodilation. So

313
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,680
the arterioles will
dilate, they release

314
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,900
nitric oxide or
prostacyclin, other

315
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,640
things, there's so
many that I'm not going

316
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,560
to go through them,
and that increases the

317
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,880
blood flow. The smooth
muscle is relaxing,

318
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,320
that increases the
blood flow. So rubor

319
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,240
and color or redness
and heat develop.

320
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,440
Now bradyocondin, as
I said, along with

321
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,480
prostaglandin E2 helps
sensitize sensory

322
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,220
nerve endings and
causes pain or dolor.

323
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,320
The bradyclining
causes veins to

324
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,380
vasoconstrict though.
I just talked about

325
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,920
vasodilation. Now
they vasoconstrict by

326
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,880
releasing prostaglandin
F2 and that will

327
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,240
then increase pressure
in the capillaries

328
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,560
as well and can lead
to leakage and you

329
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,400
get increase in
vascular permeability.

330
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:17,260
So bradyclining does
a lot of things as I

331
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,820
kind of bolded here
rubric collar paint

332
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:22,960
and vascular permeability
and you know it's

333
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,020
always confusing but
really kind of it

334
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:27,360
causes vasodilation
the low concentrations

335
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,780
and then higher it
works on the veins at

336
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:32,540
vasoconstriction but
it's mainly we need

337
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:35,210
to think of it as the
arterial vasodilator

338
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:39,780
now I mentioned
prostaglandin so I'm taking

339
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,980
another little side
trip just to define

340
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,800
this, not that you
need to know, but I

341
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,330
want you to, when I
say prostaglandins,

342
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:46,840
what am I talking about?
And you may already

343
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,860
know what I'm talking
about. But the

344
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,140
prostaglandins and
leukotrienes come from

345
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:53,880
the essential fatty
acid, linoleic acid,

346
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,600
and the release
from the membrane

347
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,340
phospholipids by the enzyme
action of phospholipids

348
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,240
A2. And this, again,
may be repeat.

349
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:05,440
Prostaglandins are
the arachidonic acid

350
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,100
mediators generated
by COX-1 and COX-2,

351
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,540
which you've
probably heard about,

352
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,760
especially in pharmacology,
causing vasodilation,

353
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,260
vascular permeability,
pain, and

354
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:16,380
fever. So this also
contributes to pain.

355
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:20,140
Note here, that's
why aspirin blocks, I

356
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:23,700
believe, one of the Cox's
here. So this is how

357
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,080
it works, and I'll
let the pharmacologist

358
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:28,060
talk about that more.
And then the leukotrienes

359
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:32,420
are mediators from
their arachidonic acid

360
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:35,320
metabolites generated
by different enzymes,

361
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,560
lipooxygenases, which
are vasoconstrictors

362
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,620
and also vascular
primitiva, bronchospasm.

363
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,740
We're not going to
talk too much about

364
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:45,240
that. I just, because I
mentioned prostaglandins,

365
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,740
I wanted to explain
it. So we've had all

366
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,760
these vascular changes
and now we have this

367
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,960
blood kind of
slowing down, edema,

368
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:56,460
margination. Okay, that's
great, but the immune

369
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,540
cells, the white blood
cells, need to go to

370
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,460
the site of the injury,
which is not going

371
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:04,300
to be necessarily inside
the vessel so we need

372
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,080
the white blood cells
to respond so this

373
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,780
is a neat way of looking
at it I didn't make

374
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:11,760
this up and I think
it's you know again

375
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,640
it's important not to
put things into very

376
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,940
strict categories but
this helps in remembering

377
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:19,640
that the cellular
response you know we've

378
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,340
had the vascular
response first mobilizes

379
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,800
the white blood cells
to get out of the

380
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,320
circulation to get to
wherever they have to go

381
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:30,060
to do their thing to
the site of cellular

382
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:33,320
injury. This whole thing
is mediated by adhesion

383
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,160
molecules and cytokines
which we'll talk

384
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,540
about and so if you
will the margination

385
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,040
that I talked about
and now we're going to

386
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,510
go into rolling and
adhesion are all called

387
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:44,990
happening within the
vessel lumen whereas

388
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:48,300
then we need to get out
of it and then we do

389
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,720
transmigration and
chemotaxis and we're going

390
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,400
to be talking about
each of these steps.

391
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,480
So how do we you
know we've marginated

392
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,740
and we need the white
blood cells to slow

393
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,220
down. Again I'm
using the example of

394
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,380
a neutrophil and a
bacterial infection.

395
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,620
This is an introduction
to cytokines and

396
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,820
basically cytokines,
and probably not for the

397
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,780
first time you've
heard, cytokines are

398
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:14,720
signaling molecules, little
proteins, and they're

399
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,300
made by cells like
macrophages and

400
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:20,920
activated limbs and they
basically modulate the

401
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,200
function of other cells.
And two major ones

402
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,860
you may want to keep
in mind are tumor

403
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:28,640
necrosis factor and
interleukin-1 which are

404
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,900
produced by activated
macrophages and lymphocytes

405
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:35,920
they are stimulated
by microbial products

406
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:39,340
immune complexes
physical injury any you

407
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:41,160
know things that
cause inflammation now

408
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,460
tnf or tumor necrosis
factor is was also or

409
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,220
is also called cachectins
for the word cachexia

410
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,920
it's very destructive
of human tissues

411
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,340
where you get cachexia
and many people who

412
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:55,260
have cancer for example
interleukin-1 is

413
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,700
called interleukin-1
because it was the first

414
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,520
one discovered and
it propagates the

415
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,040
inflammatory response at
a lot of different levels

416
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:05,260
and also significantly
affects T cells

417
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:08,420
lymphocytes so here's
another chart that comes

418
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:12,040
from Robbins and again
please don't memorize

419
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,180
it but as you can see
in acute information

420
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:17,700
TNF and IL-1 are
important and as I didn't

421
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,700
go into detail but
the principal sources

422
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,490
are listed you don't
need to know anyone

423
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:25,140
all of them but as you
notice macrophages are

424
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,080
almost everywhere in
the principal sources

425
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,440
and the principal
actions are listed in

426
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,350
the third column so
take a look at this and

427
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,060
we'll talk later about
chronic inflammation

428
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,900
so this is a really
really nice flow chart

429
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:42,840
again discussing
tumor necrosis factor

430
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,500
and interleukin one
and their local effects

431
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,560
and their systemic
effects, which I put

432
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,240
in a big red circle
because that's kind

433
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,290
of what we see in people
who have inflammation

434
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:55,160
and say an infection
of some sort.

435
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:59,680
So the local effects
include on the

436
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:03,160
vascular endothelium,
expression of the

437
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,200
adhesion molecules on
the white blood cells,

438
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,400
and we're going to
go through these,

439
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,620
but these are some of
the things they do.

440
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,380
They activate the
white blood cells,

441
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:13,620
produce cytokines, and
the fibroblast we'll

442
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:16,160
talk about more
in the healing and

443
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,880
repair session where
they proliferate, make

444
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,820
collagen, which goes
into scar production,

445
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:25,000
okay? But notice
that the systemic

446
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,240
effects, these two
are pretty important

447
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,960
cytokines because
they do affect fever.

448
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:33,280
Leucocytosis means an
increase in white blood

449
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,020
cells, usually neutrophils,
but acute phase

450
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,840
reactants are
reactants that go up in

451
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,920
inflammation appetite is
decreased if you've all

452
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,560
had the flu you know
that and sleep you

453
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:50,580
get very sleepy okay
so now we have the

454
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,620
margination and we're going
to go to rolling we're

455
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,880
going to slow down
the white blood cells

456
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,600
to get to where they
need to go and this

457
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:00,100
picture came from a
academic scholar a couple

458
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,500
years back and i think
it's really cool um i

459
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,180
never thought of it that
way but that's exactly

460
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,240
what's happening we
want to slow down

461
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,440
the white blood cells
and the big thing the

462
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,400
selectins are what
really are important here

463
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,580
the expression of selectins
on the endothelial

464
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:17,520
cells now it's important
to realize that

465
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,180
there's low affinity
adhesion molecules on

466
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,720
neutrophils and they're
called l-selectins

467
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,320
because that's sound
i think that's for a

468
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:29,580
leukocyte and endothelial
cells or e-selectins

469
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,360
neutrophils themselves
naturally express

470
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,460
it but endothelial cells
need to be stimulated

471
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,240
to express these
selectants so that

472
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,380
rolling can happen and
it is stimulated the

473
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:45,140
expression by or
regulated if you will by

474
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:48,940
tumor necrosis factor
interleukin one and

475
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:52,700
there is a binding on
this other molecule

476
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:55,460
or chemical and i don't
need you to memorize

477
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,650
that i just want you
to know the whole

478
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:02,840
general role of what's
going on so they've

479
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,000
slowing down and now
we need them to kind of

480
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,610
stop and adhere to the
inside of the vascular

481
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:11,320
endothelium so that
they're at the spot

482
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,960
where they need to go
but they're still inside

483
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,860
the blood vessels and
the way they do that

484
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:19,620
is using integrin so
selectins is for rolling

485
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:22,280
and integrins is for
adhesion keep that in

486
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:26,820
mind the mechanism of
adhesion is the activity

487
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:29,360
of high affinity
integrins again on white

488
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,560
blood cells and
endothelial cells. Now

489
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,940
integrin molecules
expressed on white blood

490
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:37,440
cells neutrophils in a
very low affinity state

491
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,300
so for them to work they
need to be activated

492
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:43,340
and things like C5A
which we'll talk about

493
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:47,860
it's a complement
protein activate them and

494
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:51,040
become they become
high affinity and here

495
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,880
come TNF and IL-1 again
for the macrophages

496
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,020
and that's going to
stimulate the expression

497
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,820
of integrin molecules
on endothelial cells.

498
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,860
This is a great,
great picture. I love

499
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:04,660
this picture because
it kind of shows in

500
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,160
visual what I've been
saying, that this

501
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,900
is a multi-step
process. This is the

502
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:13,800
white blood cell, the
big purple pink ball

503
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:17,160
there, and it's going
through the blood

504
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,040
vessel. So after
it marginates, we

505
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,860
need it to roll and
then become activated

506
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:27,180
to adhere to the
area, then it needs to

507
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:30,980
adhere. And then it
needs to cross the

508
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:33,280
endothelium by piercing
the basement membrane.

509
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,580
That's called
transmigration. Another word

510
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,960
for that is diapodesis.
And then it has

511
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,840
to get to where it's,
you know, the area

512
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,080
because it's not going
to be right there.

513
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,880
So you need chemokines
or chemoattractants

514
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,000
that come from the
injury to attractive.

515
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,840
So again, selectins are

516
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,640
important in rolling.

517
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,360
Chemokines activate
white blood cells to

518
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,640
increase the avidity
of the integrins,

519
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,860
and the integrins
are important in firm

520
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:01,420
adhesion. And then you
need transmigration.

521
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:04,040
And you see a whole
bunch of different

522
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,880
molecules here, proteins
that are listed.

523
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:09,560
And what I want you
to remember are the

524
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,940
selectins, the
integrins especially.

525
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:16,120
PCAM may come up later
on in your career.

526
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:18,420
But the important
thing is that it

527
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:20,820
doesn't happen by
magic, right? All these

528
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,480
things have to
work together with

529
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:27,180
mediators to reach
the destination and do

530
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:29,560
what they need to do.
So transmigration,

531
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:32,540
diapodesis, the
purpose is to get the

532
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,820
white blood cell
through the vessel.

533
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:38,300
And the mechanism is
the endothelial cells

534
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,830
are attracted and the
white cells go between.

535
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:43,390
This happens mostly
in post capillary

536
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:46,630
venules and the
chemokines simulate the

537
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:50,350
neutrophils that are now
adherent to inside the

538
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:52,910
vessel to get through
or migrate through the

539
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:55,190
gaps towards the
chemical concentration

540
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:58,470
which a gradient which
is the site of injury.

541
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:01,350
So they have to cross
endothelium they

542
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,910
pierce the basement
membrane and they

543
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:05,990
probably use of course
enzymes to do that

544
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:07,710
and that would be
something like collagenases

545
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,830
because that would
break up things

546
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:11,750
in the basement
membrane of the vessel.

547
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:15,490
Okay, chemotaxis, I've
been talking about

548
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:18,510
it. We just mean locomotion
along the chemical

549
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:21,230
gradient. White blood
cells follow that

550
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:24,430
gradient, and chemotactic
agents, there's a

551
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:27,390
lot of them. I put
them down in asterisks.

552
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:30,370
Some come from the
complement system. There's

553
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:33,350
arachidonic acid
metabolites, etc., etc.

554
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:35,490
Again, just realize
that There's a lot of

555
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:38,470
different mediators. And
signals from receptors,

556
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:43,210
and by the way, what
they do is they bind

557
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:45,670
to specific seven-member
G proteins coupled

558
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:48,570
receptors on the white
blood cell surfaces.

559
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:50,930
Signals from the
receptors cause second

560
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:53,290
messengers to
increase the calcium

561
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:56,370
inside the cytoplasm
and activate the

562
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:59,660
enzymes. We talked
about that in cellular

563
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:03,790
injury. and that
polymerizes actin and

564
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:05,650
localized myosin. If
you don't have the

565
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:08,630
actin and myosin, you
can't move, right?

566
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:11,600
You need that, and
that causes migration.

567
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:15,510
This is a very busy
slide, and I do not need

568
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:17,890
you to memorize the
complement system. I'm

569
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:20,810
sure if somebody else
will, I don't really

570
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:22,370
want you to. What I
want you to understand

571
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:24,610
is that the complement
system, and again this

572
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:29,280
is kind of a side um
track here uh is like

573
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:32,690
about 20 or more that
are proteins that

574
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:34,910
they're basically um
host defense against

575
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:38,350
microbes again we're
talking about a bacteria

576
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:41,470
for example the result
is important and that

577
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:44,710
is lysis breaking up
so they are activated

578
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:46,930
and with the activation
and each it's you

579
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:49,550
get this kind of cascade
and it was not as

580
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:54,570
enzymatic cascade okay
and the products that

581
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:58,230
come out of this of
the cleavage um are the

582
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:59,910
products that kind of
are important because

583
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:02,290
they some of them can
cause what we've been

584
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:04,050
talking about now
i've said things about

585
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:06,330
vascular permeability
there's a lot of things

586
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:08,600
that can cause it not
just one thing and

587
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:11,050
we're going to talk
about opsonization so

588
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:13,550
there's three pathways
again i do not need you

589
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:16,210
to memorize that somebody
will, but not me,

590
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:18,970
the classical alternate
lectin. But the whole

591
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,870
point of everything
is there on the bottom

592
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:24,910
in big letters in
red. All the pathways,

593
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:29,200
as you can see, lead
to C3 convertase enzyme

594
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:36,170
and that formation,
which splits into C3A

595
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:40,150
and C3B. And you see
it here in the chart.

596
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:45,850
The ultimate is the
C5B9, which is the

597
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:50,970
molecule that causes
the complex that causes

598
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:54,090
the cell lysis and
activation. So when you

599
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:56,310
say complement fixation,
you mean it's the

600
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:59,350
end stage of all this
cascade of all these

601
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:01,870
things, enzymatic
reaction, and ultimately

602
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:04,350
we're going to break
up or lyse cell

603
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:07,570
membranes, for example,
of a microorganism.

604
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:10,690
So the cleavage
products I mentioned,

605
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:12,550
some of them that
there's a lot, but

606
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:14,050
some of them that are
important, there's

607
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:17,510
C3A, C5A, sometimes
people put C4A,

608
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:20,510
stimulate histamine,
cause increased

609
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:23,390
vascular permeability,
evasion dilation,

610
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:25,100
they're also known
as anaphylatoxins.

611
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:28,070
I've been saying a
lot of things, and as

612
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:30,450
you can tell, there's
a lot of overlap here.

613
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:33,510
C3b is important
for opsonization and

614
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:36,530
phagocytosis, which we
have not yet discussed

615
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:38,650
and will. And the
big thing at the

616
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:42,180
end is the C5b9
formation of the membrane

617
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,830
attack complex,
which is what I was

618
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:45,750
trying to say in the
earlier slide, which

619
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:48,910
basically kills or
lysis the microbe.

620
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:49,930
That's the purpose.

621
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:55,430
Now again activation
results from

622
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:58,230
signaling pathways and
that's triggered in

623
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:00,290
the white cells.
We've got cytosolic

624
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:04,010
or cytoplasmic calcium,
the enzymes like

625
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:06,330
protein kinase C,
phospholipase C,

626
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:08,370
they're moving now,
they're activated.

627
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:14,190
How does the white
cell recognize

628
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:17,190
dead tissue or
microbes? And there's

629
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:19,870
a lot of ways.
There's receptors,

630
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:23,010
TLRs for microbial
products. There's

631
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:25,050
receptors for something
called N-formal

632
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:27,330
methylene. And then
there's the receptors

633
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:29,510
for opsins and
receptors for cytokines.

634
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:31,550
These are all
important so that you

635
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:33,410
know the white blood
cell doesn't wander

636
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:35,870
aimlessly once it's
gone through the

637
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:38,930
vascular endothelium.
It has to go to a

638
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:41,570
certain place via the
chemokine gradient.

639
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:45,290
It says receptor
for opsins and that

640
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:47,630
should be complement
proteins. I apologize.

641
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:50,470
Okay so after the
white blood cells

642
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:54,150
recognize the what
they need to do what

643
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:56,730
they need to
phagocytose if you will

644
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:59,810
there's three steps
in phagocytosis

645
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:02,130
and that is the
recognition which we

646
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:05,010
just talked about
then it has to engulf

647
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:07,470
let's say the microbe
and it has to kill

648
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:09,130
it it's not enough
to just engulf it

649
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:12,890
so this is another
good uh visual i

650
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:17,030
think about opson
opsonization uh opsonization

651
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:19,290
helps with
recognition basically.

652
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:22,850
Opsonins are attached
to a microbe and

653
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:25,310
here they look like
these blue rods

654
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:27,810
and that helps
the white cells

655
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:29,530
better recognize
them you know

656
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:33,350
kind of if you
will flagging them

657
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:36,430
and the neutrophils
have those receptors

658
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:38,950
for opsonins as I mentioned
in the last slide.

659
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:42,190
The major ones are C3B
from the complement

660
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:45,030
system but also IgG
and something called

661
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:47,290
mannospining lectin.
Now, this is what

662
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:50,330
normally should happen
in an infection, or

663
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:51,910
in a bacterial
infection, which is a

664
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:54,270
pathology. There is,
and I'm going to mention

665
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:58,730
this again, I won't
examine you on Bruton's

666
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:01,910
agammaglobinemia,
but that is the fact

667
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:05,330
in which opsins are
defective. And so

668
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:08,430
they don't recognize,
the white bloods do

669
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:10,910
not recognize what
they need to do. And

670
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:13,610
these people cannot
fight off infections.

671
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:16,730
So then we need to ingest

672
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:21,630
the organism
and engulf it.

673
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:25,750
So there's phagosomes
which fuse with lysosomes,

674
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:28,390
so you get
phagolysosomes. And again,

675
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:30,830
this is all going to
be dependent on actin

676
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:33,810
polymerization. You
need that. An example of

677
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:36,730
what happens if you don't
have that is something

678
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:38,830
called Shetty-Higasi
syndrome, where you

679
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:41,430
have a defect in the
microtubule formation

680
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:44,890
or function and you can't
form a phagolysisome

681
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:46,910
and so therefore
you can't engulf the

682
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:51,510
organism okay again that
is just that's an example

683
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:56,150
okay now we have to
kill it's hard a way

684
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:58,750
to say it but basically
a bunch of things go

685
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:02,770
through there's a very
busy visual but it's

686
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:05,450
basically what happens
the reactive oxygen

687
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:08,610
species are very
important what happens if

688
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:10,470
you go follow this all
the way down to the

689
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:14,370
bottom the big circle
there the phagocyte oxidase

690
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:19,570
activation of NADPH
oxidase oxidizes the

691
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:24,770
NADPH and the oxygen is
reduced to a superoxide

692
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:28,930
anion that these are
the reactive oxygen

693
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:31,110
species then you have
an important enzyme

694
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:34,730
called superoxide
dismutase which reduces to

695
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:40,530
H2O2 and then the white
cells if you remember

696
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:42,570
have granules in them
the neutrophils and

697
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:44,850
one of one of the
things they have in them

698
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:47,330
is myeloperoxidase and
that will combine with

699
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:49,950
chloride and convert
H2O2 to hypochlorite

700
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:54,070
which is basically bleach
which kills the the

701
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:56,010
bacteria in this case
so you can take a look

702
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:57,950
at this and go
through it and this is

703
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:00,610
basically how And I don't
mean you to, you know,

704
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:03,230
study it in such
detail that you need to

705
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:06,010
know that this oxygen
loses one ion. No,

706
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,790
you know, just
get the general

707
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:09,330
feeling of what's
going on here.

708
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,790
I want to talk a
little bit more about

709
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:15,170
phagocytosis killing.
Again, repeating myself,

710
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:17,090
reactive oxygen
species are made within

711
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:19,810
the lysosome. And you
have the phagolysisome

712
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:22,210
that can ingest whatever
you need to ingest

713
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:25,550
without damaging the
host cells. and how

714
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:27,950
do they damage cells
via membrane lipid

715
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:30,670
peroxidation, protein
modification, and DNA

716
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:32,910
breakage. There's
also an enzyme called

717
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:37,630
nitric oxide synthetase
which is nitrogen

718
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:39,790
-derived free radicals
which are all also part

719
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:41,250
of it and probably you
see in the picture.

720
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:44,650
Now lysosomal enzymes
which are in the

721
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:46,470
white blood cell
can cause tissue

722
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:49,510
damage. This is
controlled by other anti

723
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:52,090
-enzymes, antiproteases,
for example.

724
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:56,010
Another example or
two of what happens if

725
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:59,230
something in these steps
go wrong is chronic

726
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:01,790
granulomatous disease
when you don't

727
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:05,290
have NAPDH oxidase.
It's a genetic enzyme

728
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:08,110
defect, okay? And
basically, if you learn

729
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:10,750
about catalase-positive
organisms, they get

730
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:13,030
ingested, but they
don't get killed, okay?

731
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:16,230
And also, there's
something else called

732
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:19,730
MPO deficiency where
you have defective

733
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:23,330
conversion of H2O2
to hypochlorite,

734
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:24,590
which is an
increased risk for

735
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:26,770
candidate infections.
I'm just giving

736
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:29,290
those as an example.
Understand what can

737
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:32,030
go wrong if even
one step is amiss.

738
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:35,690
Okay, another, I
think I've put this in

739
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:38,270
twice, the mediators
of inflammation. Again,

740
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:41,170
take a look. Histamine
and prostaglandins

741
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:43,330
are important,
cytokines, chemokines i

742
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:45,290
haven't really talked
about platelet activating

743
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:47,630
factor and we have
discussed complement

744
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:49,810
and bradyokinin so this
is kind of a review

745
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:53,010
and again white
cells are important

746
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:58,430
especially macrophages
as you can tell now we've

747
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,890
talked about acute
inflammation so far

748
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:02,990
we can categorize them
in four broad categories

749
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:07,430
serous is an effusion
so cell poor cell

750
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:10,190
poor fluid buildup
so the example would

751
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:12,230
be a blister which
you see on top on that

752
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:15,090
person's finger that's
serous fluid it's

753
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:18,250
very it's straw like
clear it's watery you

754
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:20,390
might even get a
viral pleuritis in the

755
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:23,490
pleural cavity of the
lung and that's serous.

756
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:26,320
Fibrinous it happens
when there's increased

757
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,260
permeability and you
have more of an exudate

758
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:31,110
and then you get
fibrin deposition

759
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:33,470
increased fibrin and
the example of that is

760
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:35,930
fibrinous pericarditis
which is the second

761
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:37,930
picture down which is
a heart believe it or

762
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:40,730
not covered in exudate,
covered in fibrin

763
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:43,690
exudate. This would
happen in pericarditis.

764
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:46,530
Sepurative, that's
the other word for

765
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:49,670
purulent or *****,
is again exudative

766
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:53,730
and usually happens
with pyogenic bacteria,

767
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:55,870
things like
staphylococcus. And this

768
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:59,350
poor person has a
very bad pus-filled

769
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:03,410
lesion on their
hand. And when you

770
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:06,590
have it localized,
it's basically

771
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:09,150
called an abscess.
is a localization of

772
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:12,490
pus and it could
be in or outside.

773
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:14,970
And then an ulcer is
all the way on the

774
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:16,970
bottom. That's when the
surface of the tissue

775
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:20,370
is basically excavated
and that's because

776
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:25,370
the necrotic tissue
is inflamed and sheds.

777
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:28,550
Okay so we've come
to the point where

778
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:31,090
we need the acute
inflammation to stop or

779
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:33,310
else it's going to
get really damaging.

780
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:35,850
So what can happen?
Well, we can have

781
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:38,350
a complete resolution
of, you know, you

782
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:40,430
get a cut, it gets
a little infected,

783
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:42,580
and you put
some neosporin

784
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:43,590
on and it goes away.

785
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:46,430
This is a, you know,
complete resolution

786
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:48,810
would be with a
minor injury and

787
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:52,090
labile and stable
cells, which I will

788
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:54,830
talk about more in
healing and repair.

789
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:57,530
Or what can happen
is there's a lot of

790
00:36:57,530 --> 00:36:59,390
tissue destruction
and extensive injury,

791
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:01,630
in which case
you'll be healing by

792
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:05,290
scar again for the
next session and or

793
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:08,090
you can go into
chronic inflammation.

794
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:11,190
Let's talk a little bit
now on chronic we've

795
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:13,400
talked about acute
enough persistent

796
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,770
infections okay things
that don't go away or

797
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:17,610
their prolonged duration
can lead to chronic

798
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:20,350
inflammation attempts
you know there's

799
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:22,670
tissue injury attempts
to repair occurring

800
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:25,550
at the same time again
I'm repeating myself

801
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:27,150
the tissue destruction
with attempts at

802
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:30,090
healing by connective
tissue replacement and

803
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:32,990
again this this bullet
point is a will be

804
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:36,550
talked about a lot in
healing and repair.

805
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:40,090
The chronic
inflammatory cells are

806
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:43,830
mostly lymphocytes,
macrophages, plasma

807
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:46,550
cells and to some
extent eosinophils.

808
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:49,770
Macrophages by the
way known as monocytes

809
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:51,730
in the bloodstream
are also known

810
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:54,530
as histiocytes out
you know when they're

811
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:56,370
in tissue. I just
put that in because

812
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:58,030
some books use the
term it's an ultram

813
00:37:58,030 --> 00:38:00,650
histiocyte meaning
tissue cell

814
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:03,010
basically but it's
also it's a macrophage.

815
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:06,770
Chronic inflammation
can lead to immune

816
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:10,370
mediated inflammatory
diseases autoimmune diseases

817
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:12,830
like rheumatoid
arthritis and you can get

818
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:15,950
once you get prolonged
exposure to toxins

819
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:21,230
like asbestos for
example or chronic

820
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:23,270
inflammation that
causes atherosclerosis

821
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:25,710
these are all topics
for a second year,

822
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:28,090
you can also get
chronic inflammation.

823
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:31,230
So the monocytes and
the macrophages, again

824
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:33,730
the monocytes come
out of the blood, they

825
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:35,970
extravasate into the
connective tissue and

826
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:38,890
they transform into
macrophages. The important

827
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:40,830
thing to remember
is neutrophils come

828
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:44,370
first and then the
macrophages become dominant

829
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:46,970
cell by about 48 hours.
This is something

830
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:49,090
that's going to come
up again and again.

831
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:52,110
Now does that mean
at 48 hours all the

832
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:53,930
macrophages there all
the neutrophils are

833
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:58,310
gone no this is a process
so but the important

834
00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:00,110
thing to remember is
macrophages appear

835
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:02,470
after the neutrophils
though you may

836
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:04,830
still have neutrophils
around tissue

837
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:09,270
macrophages can live
for a long time and they

838
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:12,810
help eliminate injurious
agents and help

839
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:15,950
also in making growth
factors again which

840
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:20,090
we'll talk about in
the next topic to cause

841
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:23,270
tissue repair. Now,
can you have acute

842
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:25,250
and chronic inflammation
together? Yeah.

843
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:27,370
Chronic inflammation
sometimes will show

844
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:30,850
neutrophils because
the organisms are still

845
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:33,910
there. Our mediators
are being produced by

846
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:37,050
macrophages and T
lymphocytes. And in fact, when

847
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:40,810
we think about viral
infections, we tend to

848
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:42,850
think that it's lymphocytes
that predominate.

849
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:45,250
they may be the first
cells to arrive in

850
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:47,810
that case it's kind of
a little weird so if

851
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:49,770
a person has a viral
infection usually and

852
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:51,630
you do their white
blood cell count the

853
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:54,030
lymphocytes will be higher
than their neutrophils

854
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:57,630
but and i'll say it
again in acute infections

855
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:59,720
especially bacteria
the neutrophils

856
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:02,850
predominate many many
ways that's because they

857
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:05,450
are the most common
cell in the blood if you

858
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:08,170
recall from histology
of blood uh they're

859
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:10,830
more numerous they respond
quicker to chemokines

860
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:13,030
and they come within
six to 24 hours and

861
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:15,530
they also attach more
firmly to adhesion

862
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:18,450
molecules they don't
last long they're short

863
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:21,490
-lived and will undergo
apoptosis which we

864
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:25,830
discussed within 24 to
48 hours this is a very

865
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:29,390
nice chart I think
comparing acute inflammation

866
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:31,810
to chronic inflammation
I urge you to look

867
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:34,470
at it I don't like
memorization try to

868
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:37,710
understand what's going
on um you know we uh

869
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:41,170
we have discussed some
of this and this is

870
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:44,430
just to help you organize
all the words if you

871
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:49,660
will and thoughts again
um i think this is

872
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:52,430
this is the one i did
in twice for some reason

873
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:55,110
um i just put in
acute inflammation and

874
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:56,950
chronic inflammation
in red just to separate

875
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:59,390
them too but i want you
to know this the tnf

876
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:04,930
and the il1 on top
okay just so to recall,

877
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:08,430
this is a neutrophil
lymphocyte and

878
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:10,930
macrophage. Okay, we
discussed this on histology

879
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:13,230
of blood. The
neutrophil is on the top

880
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:15,450
left. It's got
multiple lobes, about

881
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:18,450
four, and remember it
has granules in it.

882
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:21,370
The lymphocyte is right
next to it on top.

883
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:23,870
It's got a big nucleus
and a little bit

884
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:27,170
bluer cytoplasm, and
it's smaller. And on

885
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:31,210
the bottom is a
macrophage monocyte, I

886
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:32,570
should call it, because
it's in the blood,

887
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:34,970
it again has this
kind of kidney-shaped

888
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:37,710
nucleus, big, and I
always like to think

889
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:39,510
of it as like an
amoeba because it

890
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:41,510
kind of conforms to
shape, but you don't

891
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:43,140
have to think of it
that way, but those

892
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:46,370
are the way they
look under the cell.

893
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:49,170
We had discussed
T lymphocytes

894
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:51,170
and B lymphocytes,
so as a review,

895
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:53,630
remember that the
progenitor T cells

896
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:55,850
are in bone marrow
and they get

897
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:57,290
further developed
in the thymus,

898
00:41:57,290 --> 00:41:58,870
that's why they're
called T cells.

899
00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:02,270
TCR undergoes your
rearrangement and you

900
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:06,490
get cd4 helper and
cd8 and um the b cells

901
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:08,650
are produced in the
bone marrow under the

902
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:11,170
immature ones they
undergo an immunoglobulin

903
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:14,590
rearrangement to become
naive b cells and

904
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:17,010
they express immunoglobulins
like igm that's

905
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:19,710
for acute uh and then
again like i said

906
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:22,170
this is somewhat
repetitive somewhat um

907
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:25,290
you've had some of this
and we'll go to have

908
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:27,290
it again and again so
that's the nice thing

909
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:30,870
about medicine in a
way uh i was told by

910
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:32,870
my dean when i was in
medical school that

911
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:34,430
you know it's repetitive
and it's repetitive

912
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:36,270
for a reason because
all these things

913
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:39,330
it's not just a matter
you can't just memorize

914
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:40,790
you got to remember
when we go into

915
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:42,730
myocardial infarction
this is going to become

916
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:45,210
an important point again
about the inflammation

917
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:48,370
because it's
necrosis uh activated

918
00:42:48,370 --> 00:42:50,470
there are different
macrophages just as a

919
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:52,910
reminder m1 and M2,
if they're classically

920
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:55,570
activated, that comes
from interferon gamma.

921
00:42:56,050 --> 00:42:58,250
And again, this
is for chronic

922
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:00,330
inflammation, and
they secrete different

923
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:02,190
interleukins, like
interleukin-12.

924
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:03,230
The

925
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:07,370
alternatively activated
macrophages, or M2,

926
00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:10,470
promote growth factors,
especially TGF-beta.

927
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:12,090
Now, TGF-beta is
going to become really

928
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:14,990
important in the next
lecture, because it is

929
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:18,550
a big a fibrogenic
mediator, and it's

930
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:21,530
important in fibrosis
and tissue repair, okay?

931
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,850
This is a chart kind
of saying what I

932
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:28,270
just said, but
again, for those who

933
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:30,970
are more visual, and
I am, I think this

934
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:32,850
helps put it more
into perspective.

935
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:35,930
I really need, I feel
interleukin one is

936
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:37,790
important. Remember
that interleukin 12

937
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:39,270
is for chronic, but
you don't need to

938
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:42,390
memorize all of them
okay one thing you will

939
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:46,330
eventually get to IL
-5 becomes is important

940
00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:48,870
eosinophils but
right now just worry

941
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:51,370
about the overall
what's going on here.

942
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:56,030
More on T lymphocytes
cytokines from the

943
00:43:56,030 --> 00:43:58,230
activated macrophils
recruit the lymphocytes

944
00:43:58,230 --> 00:44:01,150
and the CD4-positor
or helper to

945
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:03,910
secrete cytokines and
that really depends on

946
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:07,630
the subset of the
T cells so TH1, TH1

947
00:44:07,630 --> 00:44:10,470
helper cells produce
interferon gamma, which

948
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:12,610
activates macrophages
via the classical

949
00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:16,170
pathway. T helper
2's subset produces

950
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:18,770
these interleukins.
And as you can tell,

951
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:20,810
IL-5 that I just said
is right there in the

952
00:44:20,810 --> 00:44:22,630
middle and that
activates eosinophils.

953
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:27,810
And then there's Th17
that secretes interleukin

954
00:44:27,810 --> 00:44:30,690
17. And that's also
important as well.

955
00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:32,490
So there's many,
many, and the point is

956
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:35,650
the different subsets
are recruited. and

957
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:38,250
the lymphocytes and the
macrophages they work

958
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:41,110
bi-directionally and
by that I mean this

959
00:44:41,110 --> 00:44:45,150
really gorgeous picture
I think of how the

960
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:47,770
monocyte activated
macrophage and t-cell

961
00:44:47,770 --> 00:44:50,990
up here on the top
they they go you know

962
00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:53,350
goes back and forth it's
not like one way and

963
00:44:53,350 --> 00:44:56,410
I this comes from
figure 321 in Robbins

964
00:44:56,410 --> 00:44:58,670
and I urge you to take
a look at it because

965
00:44:58,670 --> 00:45:00,210
we're right now we're
going to go into the

966
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:03,730
formation of a granuloma,
which is, we had

967
00:45:03,730 --> 00:45:06,970
discussed granulomatous
necrosis. Okay,

968
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:08,930
so look at this as a
macrophage lymphocyte

969
00:45:08,930 --> 00:45:11,010
interactions in chronic
inflammation. Right

970
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:13,130
now we're in chronic.
So when we have

971
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:17,310
granulomas, which we
had mentioned, it's a

972
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:21,250
chronic inflammation and
it's an attempt to at

973
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:26,230
least try to contain
the offending organism

974
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:29,030
or agent, which is
going be difficult to

975
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:31,430
get rid of and one of
the big examples is

976
00:45:31,430 --> 00:45:34,230
tuberculosis or
mycobacteria tuberculosis

977
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:37,470
macrophages process
and present antigen

978
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:40,130
to the helper t-cells
that interaction

979
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:43,310
produces cytokines
like il2 which activate

980
00:45:43,310 --> 00:45:46,190
other t-cells and this
goes on and perpetuates

981
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:48,810
response by causing
secretion of

982
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:51,930
interferon gamma
another important one as

983
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:54,510
well that leads to
macrophage activation

984
00:45:54,510 --> 00:45:58,450
macrophages become
histiocytes or yeah

985
00:45:58,450 --> 00:46:01,210
they're called epitheloid
histiocytes and

986
00:46:01,210 --> 00:46:04,930
giant cells and you
get a granuloma and as

987
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:07,510
I mentioned in the
past you can have a

988
00:46:07,510 --> 00:46:11,230
necrotizing or a non
-necrotizing granuloma.

989
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:14,650
Necrotizing if you
look at it it looks

990
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:17,330
like cheesy material
so when you see

991
00:46:17,330 --> 00:46:19,760
it grossly we use
the term caseating,

992
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,760
necrotizing is more
for microscopic.

993
00:46:23,390 --> 00:46:26,110
So here are examples
of some granulomas.

994
00:46:26,110 --> 00:46:27,850
On top is a
sarcoid granuloma

995
00:46:27,850 --> 00:46:30,070
and that is an
immune response. Okay

996
00:46:30,070 --> 00:46:32,030
so we've got a
sarcoid granuloma and

997
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:33,970
a tattoo granuloma
on the bottom.

998
00:46:34,570 --> 00:46:36,310
That's a foreign
body when you

999
00:46:36,310 --> 00:46:37,990
think about that
black stuff in there,

1000
00:46:37,990 --> 00:46:39,070
brown stuff,
that's the pigment

1001
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:41,210
and the body is
reacting to it.

1002
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:44,270
Sarcoidosis you have
persistent T cell immune

1003
00:46:44,270 --> 00:46:47,310
response. So the
granuloma again for

1004
00:46:47,310 --> 00:46:49,970
definition is really an
aggregate of macrophages

1005
00:46:49,970 --> 00:46:51,490
that kind of come
together and this is

1006
00:46:51,490 --> 00:46:54,150
chronic inflammation
they're transformed into

1007
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:57,330
epithelial like cells
and they're surrounded

1008
00:46:57,330 --> 00:47:00,850
by a lot of lymphocytes
some plasma cells

1009
00:47:00,850 --> 00:47:03,130
and also they may have
giant cells which you

1010
00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:06,410
see in the next picture
again to reiterate

1011
00:47:06,410 --> 00:47:08,970
this happens when the
immune system attempts

1012
00:47:08,970 --> 00:47:11,610
to isolate something
foreign but it's

1013
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:15,710
unable to eliminate it
so tuberculosis is one

1014
00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:18,990
big one fungi foreign
objects keratin suture

1015
00:47:18,990 --> 00:47:21,030
fragments you can get
a suture granuloma

1016
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:23,370
meaning in the area if
it's too big it will

1017
00:47:23,370 --> 00:47:26,930
form a granuloma around
the suture this is

1018
00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:30,570
a very high power
picture of a caseating or

1019
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:34,990
necrotizing granuloma
um this turned out

1020
00:47:34,990 --> 00:47:37,850
to be uh again a tb
infection and this

1021
00:47:37,850 --> 00:47:40,970
is like that big pink
blobby stuff on the

1022
00:47:40,970 --> 00:47:43,710
right that's just all
necrotic tissue um

1023
00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:46,330
it's the caseous
center the necrotizing

1024
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:49,350
granuloma. On the edge
you see some giant

1025
00:47:49,350 --> 00:47:52,470
cells and other
chronic inflammation.

1026
00:47:52,610 --> 00:47:55,530
And a word about
eosinophils. When you

1027
00:47:55,530 --> 00:47:57,550
see eosinophils there's
a big blue arrow

1028
00:47:57,550 --> 00:47:59,470
pointing to one of
them. They're very red.

1029
00:47:59,890 --> 00:48:02,150
Think allergies,
asthma, and

1030
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:03,810
parasites. We've
said that before.

1031
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:08,050
They have granules with
major basic protein

1032
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:10,810
that are toxic to
parasites. They also

1033
00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:13,730
cause lysis of mammalian
epithelial cells.

1034
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:16,250
So they do help in
killing parasites,

1035
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:18,450
but they also contribute
to tissue damage

1036
00:48:18,450 --> 00:48:20,770
and things like
allergies and asthma.

1037
00:48:20,770 --> 00:48:23,430
This is a high picture,
a high power picture

1038
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:25,970
of a bronchus with
somebody who has

1039
00:48:26,350 --> 00:48:28,330
asthma. So they have
a lot of eosinophils.

1040
00:48:29,670 --> 00:48:32,250
Okay, so let's go to
some case questions,

1041
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:34,950
which are just
general. But a 24-year

1042
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:36,990
-old woman is nursing
her newborn baby,

1043
00:48:36,990 --> 00:48:39,210
and she has a tender
erythematous area

1044
00:48:39,210 --> 00:48:41,230
around the ******
of her left breast.

1045
00:48:41,230 --> 00:48:43,510
Thick yellow
fluid is observed

1046
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:46,150
to drain from
an open fissure.

1047
00:48:46,310 --> 00:48:48,490
Examination of the
yellow breast fluid under

1048
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:51,350
the light microscope
will most likely reveal

1049
00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:54,130
an abundance of which
inflammatory cells.

1050
00:48:54,330 --> 00:48:56,450
Okay, so think
about this.

1051
00:48:56,510 --> 00:48:59,230
And this is pus. I
hope you recognize

1052
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:01,810
this is pus. And
pus is pyogenic or

1053
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:04,810
purulent exudate
caused by usually

1054
00:49:04,810 --> 00:49:09,270
bacteria. and that would
be the major player

1055
00:49:09,270 --> 00:49:11,370
there would be
neutrophils. So the

1056
00:49:11,370 --> 00:49:14,250
answer is D as in
David neutrophils.

1057
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:16,990
Okay that's the answer
here. The next case

1058
00:49:16,990 --> 00:49:19,850
question is a 19 year
old woman. She has a

1059
00:49:19,850 --> 00:49:23,370
five-day history of
fever up to 101. Sore

1060
00:49:23,370 --> 00:49:26,670
throat. She's been
tired and has difficulty

1061
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:29,430
swallowing and they
do a physical. They

1062
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:31,250
see generalized
lymphadenopathy. They probably

1063
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:32,790
see a lot of other
things. I just shortened

1064
00:49:32,790 --> 00:49:35,850
the question. So
if she has a viral

1065
00:49:35,850 --> 00:49:38,930
infection, a CBC or a
complete blood count will

1066
00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:41,130
most likely show which
of the following.

1067
00:49:41,970 --> 00:49:44,890
Okay, this is a bit
trickier because

1068
00:49:44,890 --> 00:49:47,310
there are two correct
answers, as I have

1069
00:49:47,310 --> 00:49:49,230
mentioned in the
past, but one is the

1070
00:49:49,230 --> 00:49:50,870
better answer and
is the one you need

1071
00:49:50,870 --> 00:49:55,490
to go with. Okay,
so viral infection,

1072
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:58,110
usually lymphocytes
will be increased.

1073
00:49:58,110 --> 00:50:01,010
So the answer again
is D as in David,

1074
00:50:01,050 --> 00:50:05,050
lymphocytosis. Now, B
is also correct, B as

1075
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:07,030
in boy, because there
will be an increase

1076
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:08,990
in white blood cell
count in general.

1077
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:12,050
That's a general
thing. What we want to

1078
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:14,090
get more specific here
is because the question

1079
00:50:14,090 --> 00:50:16,730
asked about viral,
so the answer is D.

1080
00:50:16,910 --> 00:50:18,230
And of course, leukopenia

1081
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:20,310
means low white
cell count.

1082
00:50:21,270 --> 00:50:24,050
A seven-year-old
falls from his scooter

1083
00:50:24,050 --> 00:50:26,210
and injuries and
injures his ankle.

1084
00:50:26,210 --> 00:50:28,410
He becomes swollen,
red, painful.

1085
00:50:28,710 --> 00:50:30,730
Which of the following
is most responsible

1086
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:32,890
for all three of
these consequences?

1087
00:50:34,570 --> 00:50:36,010
So again,

1088
00:50:36,130 --> 00:50:38,610
I happen to
like D a lot. D

1089
00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:40,150
as in David
is the answer.

1090
00:50:40,730 --> 00:50:43,090
Now all of these kind
of histamine nitric

1091
00:50:43,090 --> 00:50:46,330
oxide causes a swell
you know redness

1092
00:50:46,330 --> 00:50:49,030
and heat and it helps
with the vascular

1093
00:50:49,030 --> 00:50:50,610
permeability. Those
are all true and

1094
00:50:50,610 --> 00:50:52,530
selections and integrins
are involved in

1095
00:50:52,530 --> 00:50:55,850
the rolling and the
adhesion but bradykinin

1096
00:50:55,850 --> 00:50:57,470
if you remember
that chart we saw

1097
00:50:57,790 --> 00:51:01,070
it's very important for
pain but it also does

1098
00:51:01,070 --> 00:51:02,890
things like increased
vascular permeability

1099
00:51:02,890 --> 00:51:05,830
and vasodilates so
that's why D would be

1100
00:51:05,830 --> 00:51:09,230
acceptable in this
answer here's a summary

1101
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:11,950
slide and of course the
lecture feedback form

1102
00:51:11,950 --> 00:51:15,990
please please reach me
by email or my office

1103
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:18,710
is rockefellow306 on
Long Island campus.

1104
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:21,890
And, you know,
if you have any

1105
00:51:21,890 --> 00:51:24,230
questions, don't
hesitate and do it sooner

1106
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:25,510
rather than
later. Don't do it

1107
00:51:25,510 --> 00:51:27,630
near the exam. Try
to do it, you know,

1108
00:51:27,630 --> 00:51:29,330
as soon as you
have the question.

1109
00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:33,290
And I like to do
things in person. So if

1110
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:36,010
you want to schedule
either an in-person

1111
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:38,330
meeting or Zoom,
especially for those in

1112
00:51:38,330 --> 00:51:41,350
Arkansas, I like to do
that rather than write

1113
00:51:41,350 --> 00:51:44,370
you a long, long, long,
long email. So you

1114
00:51:44,370 --> 00:51:46,030
can just say, can
we schedule a Zoom?

1115
00:51:46,030 --> 00:51:48,490
Okay, this was a lot
of material and I want

1116
00:51:48,490 --> 00:51:50,090
to thank you very much
for your attention.
