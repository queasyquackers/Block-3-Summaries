00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:03,870
Hello, everybody.

2
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:13,670
This is Dr. Maria
Plummer. Sorry about the

3
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:15,830
delay. This is our
first pathology lecture.

4
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:17,100
We're going to
discuss cellular

5
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:20,990
adaptation and cellular
injury and cell death.

6
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:24,130
These are the session
objectives that should

7
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:27,250
be the same in your
CPG. And these are the

8
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:30,170
general topics that
we will be hitting on.

9
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:31,750
Okay,

10
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:37,010
I do realize that the
histology as a subject

11
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:39,250
has been reduced in
most medical schools.

12
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:42,130
And I want to start
out by saying that one

13
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:43,850
thing important
about pathology is to

14
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:46,250
know how the abnormal
looks from the normal.

15
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:51,190
Having said that, I
do realize that this

16
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:53,910
is your first year,
first semester. So you

17
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:57,790
still need to know
about the epithelium,

18
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:59,290
like where it is,
what it is, and stuff

19
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:01,370
like that. But I bring
you these pictures

20
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,130
to remind you hopefully
you've had some of

21
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:08,250
this and also I want to
make it clear that in

22
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,610
your first semester
first year I generally

23
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:13,530
do not I can't say
always but generally do

24
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,310
not put pictures on
an exam for first year

25
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:19,690
first semester medical
student it's not time

26
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:22,070
yet I believe to do it
afterwards in second

27
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:24,630
semester and then in
your second year but the

28
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:27,070
boards do do pictures
and I don't believe in

29
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:28,620
just putting a picture
and telling you to

30
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:31,390
to recognize that you
can't do that but I do

31
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:34,410
want to remind you about
the types of epithelial

32
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:36,610
tissues here. The
one especially we're

33
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:39,370
going to talk about
later will be the one on

34
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:41,310
the bottom in the left
stratified squamous

35
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,750
esophagus and the one
over on the bottom right

36
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,390
the pseudostratified
columnar. As you can

37
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:50,590
tell in the stratified
squamous it's usually

38
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:53,890
the esophagus it's a
protective epithelium

39
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:57,410
and for the pseudostratified
columnar that's

40
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:00,230
the trachea where you
have cilia and that

41
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,890
helps with it taking out
pollutants and things

42
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,650
like that but they're
all kind of important

43
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:07,050
the thing is that just
realize that there

44
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:10,190
are different types and
I don't mean for you

45
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:12,510
to recognize it but
you do want to see it

46
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,150
when we look side by
side so pathology is the

47
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,510
study of the structural
biochemical and

48
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:22,410
functional changes in
cells uh tissues and organs

49
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:25,150
underlying disease and
that That is a direct

50
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:28,370
definition from my
particular Bible, which

51
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:31,910
is Robins and Cotron,
pathological basis of

52
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:34,410
disease. They just came
out with a new issue

53
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:37,730
this year. So a lot
of this is from that.

54
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:41,310
General pathology versus
systemic pathology

55
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,790
just means that what
we're going to talk

56
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:44,790
about the next few
lectures is general

57
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:48,390
pathology. The groundwork
basically that is very

58
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:51,950
important, though
it's not as exciting I

59
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:54,350
think anyway as the
systemic pathology which

60
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:56,490
discusses the different
organ systems.

61
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,610
Okay, but no matter what
general or systemic,

62
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:03,090
we want to in
pathology we want to

63
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:05,030
think about etiology
which is the

64
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:07,350
cause of a disease,
the pathogenesis,

65
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,690
the changes, the
morphological

66
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,450
changes that
are associated,

67
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:13,650
and the clinical
manifestations.

68
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:17,950
This is a really good
overall picture from

69
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:21,090
the text which shows
the normal cell all the

70
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:23,190
way on the top and
generally the first part

71
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,750
of this lecture we're
going to talk about

72
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,550
adaptation which is all
the way to the left.

73
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:30,310
When there's a
stressor just like

74
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,710
human being cells
need to adapt. If

75
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:34,930
you can't adapt it
will be a problem.

76
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,370
So we're going to talk
about the cellular

77
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:40,190
adaptations first
however if there's

78
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,390
an inability to adapt
for whatever reason

79
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,960
or if the stimulus
is very injurious

80
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,050
there's going to be
injury and then And

81
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:50,470
there is a matter
of time whether that

82
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:53,210
injury is reversible
or irreversible.

83
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:57,070
And irreversible
injury can usually

84
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,850
lead to necrosis,
but we're also

85
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:00,410
going to talk
about another type

86
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:02,640
of cell death
called apoptosis.

87
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,370
Okay, so let's
start with the first

88
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,010
adaptation is hypertrophy,
which is an increase

89
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:11,530
in the size of cells
that, of course,

90
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:12,970
the organ is going to
get increased. Please

91
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,770
note that in
hypertrophy there are no

92
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:17,370
new cells. it's the
size that's increased.

93
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:21,410
In hypertrophy you have
increased production

94
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:23,950
of protein in the
cells because growth

95
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:27,150
factors are activated
and also because

96
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:29,390
of mechanical force
and now you'll see

97
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:31,310
what I mean in a second
that stimulate the

98
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:33,310
protein pathways to
protein synthesis.

99
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,510
Now hypertrophy
like a lot of

100
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:38,530
adaptations has two
types physiologic

101
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:41,330
and pathologic and
physiologic means

102
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:45,510
basically normal increased
functional demands

103
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:48,150
stimulation by growth
factors or hormones

104
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:53,050
and examples are better
to define this which

105
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:55,150
means things like
uterine growth during

106
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:58,910
pregnancy skeletal
muscle in response to you

107
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:01,730
know working out so your
bodybuilding those are

108
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:03,710
physiological hypertrophy
they're supposed

109
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:05,690
to happen they're
supposed to happen there's

110
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:08,370
nothing wrong with
that pathologic would

111
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:12,090
mean it has to do with
a disease so the heart

112
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:15,450
and hypertension the
blood pressure is elevated

113
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,230
if it's elevated
the heart is working

114
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:21,950
against the vasculature
and it has to pump

115
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:24,830
harder and so it's a
muscle and it's going to

116
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:29,670
increase in size by
increasing the cell size

117
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,810
that would also happen
in something like

118
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:34,150
aortic stenosis where
you have the aortic

119
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:36,810
bowel which leads out
from the left ventricle

120
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:41,610
that is narrow and
the blood has to the

121
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,270
heart has to work
hard to push out the

122
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:45,310
blood. Same thing it's
going to work hard and

123
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,790
like skeletal muscle
it will hypertrophy.

124
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:50,390
So this is a picture
granted it's from a

125
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:53,570
mouse but this is
myocardial. I don't expect

126
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:59,190
you to identify this
because again you

127
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:02,070
may recognize that
this is a cardiac

128
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,710
muscle or not. The
point being that on the

129
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:07,060
left is normal, the
right is hypertrophy.

130
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:09,530
It's hypertrophy
because the cells, this

131
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:11,770
is a longitudinal
section, are thicker,

132
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:14,070
they're bigger, even
the nuclei are bigger.

133
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:17,650
So this is hypertrophy
and it's the result

134
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:20,610
of cellular protein
production increase.

135
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:23,370
A lot of ways
that can happen is

136
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:27,170
mechanical sensors
will detect increased

137
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:31,570
load like the heart
filling or heart

138
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:35,870
pumping or your
pumping iron. Sensors

139
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,970
will activate
signaling pathways.

140
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,750
I don't need
you to memorize

141
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,150
these pathways
you probably learn

142
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,740
about them in
other lectures.

143
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,550
Some other signaling
pathways will be

144
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:49,930
increased production
of growth factors and

145
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:52,210
even vasoactive
agents. So basically

146
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:54,870
what we need is activation
of transcription

147
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:57,070
factors which is
increase the expression

148
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:59,620
of genes, and that
in the case of

149
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,710
muscle will encode
contractile proteins.

150
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:06,010
What I just said is
illustrated, if you're

151
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:07,730
much more of an
image person, I do

152
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,810
this a lot. I will talk
it through and then

153
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:11,330
I'll give you the
image. This is directly

154
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,390
from the book, this
is exactly what I

155
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,830
just said, probably
a few things added

156
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:17,950
here. I don't need
you to memorize this

157
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,970
particular figure,
but you should look at

158
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,450
it and understand
it, what's going on.

159
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:26,210
So let's start with,
let's go to another

160
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,970
adaptation i'm going
to give you two cases

161
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:30,410
i'm going to talk about
it this is a 70 year

162
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:32,830
old man who complains
of difficulty urinating

163
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:36,630
is a weak urinary
system and um has to

164
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,450
get a lot of times
in the night that's

165
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:41,470
called bacteria to go
to go urinary his PSA

166
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:45,210
the prostate specific
antigen is mildly

167
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:48,730
elevated and as you as
you may or may not know

168
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:51,450
PSA can be elevated in
benign and malignant

169
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:55,070
processes of the
prostate. He undergoes

170
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,910
a transurethal resection
of this prostate.

171
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,810
Okay and what do they
find now again now

172
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:02,910
we're going to look at
tissue. Okay so on the

173
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:06,010
bottom with the blue
box is normal prostate

174
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:10,410
and on the top left
of the two boxes is a

175
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:13,230
lower power and a higher
power view of this

176
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:15,610
man's prostate. So you
have to ask yourself

177
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:17,630
okay again what type
of epithelium is

178
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:21,270
present this is glandular
or columnar epithelium

179
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,510
okay it's not squamous
it's not transitional

180
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:26,650
it's glandular um and
that's what because

181
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:29,830
remember prostate
secretes things um is

182
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,890
there an increase in
the number of cells and

183
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:34,230
the answer to that is
going to be yes and

184
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:36,910
what do we call this
adaptation and you'll

185
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:39,590
i will reveal that in a
second after i present

186
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:42,310
the next case which
is a 45 year old

187
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:45,130
woman who is pale and weak
and she has a decrease

188
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:47,150
from her red blood
cell count she has

189
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:50,210
anemia but her bone
marrow biopsy shows an

190
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:53,170
increase in red blood
cell precursor cells so

191
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:55,950
that indicates an
attempt to compensate for

192
00:08:55,950 --> 00:09:00,070
the decrease in the
rbcs and this is what

193
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:02,470
it looks like on the
top again i don't expect

194
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:04,990
you to recognize this
on the top is normal

195
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:07,250
bone marrow with all
the three lineages

196
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:11,750
if you remember um
the the rbcs the white

197
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,390
cells the platelets and
on the bottom although

198
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:17,630
that's a much more
magnified picture those

199
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:20,330
that's a bone marrow
of this woman who has

200
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:23,530
uh increased erythroid
precursors I do not

201
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,470
expect you to recognize
that what you see

202
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:29,350
in um the middle here
I mean in the lower

203
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:32,650
left is a large cell
that's a megakaryocyte

204
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:36,750
and all the really
dark almost black but

205
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,610
they're really kind
of blue black uh cells

206
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,770
are erythroid
precursors so you're not

207
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:43,350
supposed to have this
many okay and and and

208
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,510
i gave you a question
i would say there

209
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,490
would be increased
irregular precursors i

210
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:49,690
don't necessarily need
you to identify them

211
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:53,470
not at this point yet
so what process is

212
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:55,230
going on here in the
bone marrow and also

213
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:57,450
in that man with
the prostate and the

214
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:00,250
answer is you can stop
the tape if you want

215
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:04,330
but it's hyperplasia a
bone marrow undergoes

216
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:06,970
rapid hyperplasia
because it's responding

217
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:09,350
to the deficiency
in red blood cells.

218
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,170
So if there's any
acute bleeding or

219
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,550
hemolysis, there's
feedback loops and there's

220
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:18,190
a growth factor slash
hormone or erythopoietin

221
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:19,770
that's activated
from the kidney

222
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:22,110
and it stimulates the
growth of red cell

223
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:24,810
progenitors and allows
the red cell production

224
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:26,250
to increase. So
that's a good thing

225
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,250
because it's a
compensatory thing and it's

226
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,870
more. So what is
this hyperplasia? It

227
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:34,510
means an increased
number of cells, okay?

228
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,010
Hypertrophy is increased
size, hyperplasia

229
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:39,610
increased number and
it's usually in response

230
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:42,050
to something a stimulus
and it can only

231
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:44,410
happen in tissues if
they're capable of

232
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,350
dividing and i'll get
into that in a little

233
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:50,630
bit now some organs some
tissue types um will

234
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,910
have both hyperplasia
and hypertrophy but

235
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,910
that does not happen
in permanent tissue

236
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:57,390
which we'll discuss in
a second hyperplasia

237
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:00,090
is the result of
growth factor driven

238
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:03,530
proliferation of cells
mature cells but sometimes

239
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,450
it's also increased
output of new cells

240
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:08,730
from tissue stem cells
there are two types

241
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:11,210
like in hypertrophy
there's physiologic or

242
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:14,450
pathologic physiologic
usually is due to

243
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:17,070
hormones growth factors
when they're needed

244
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:20,870
to increase the function
of hormone sensitive

245
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:23,050
organs or when you
need a compensatory

246
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,690
increase because of
damage so one of the

247
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:30,330
two of the best um
examples would be the

248
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:33,250
breast at puberty the
uterus at pregnancy even

249
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,990
the breasts at pregnancy
where the uterus

250
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:39,150
of pregnancy would
grow probably a little

251
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:41,630
bit of both but the
point is that the puberty

252
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:44,350
breast is increasing
the number of cells

253
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:46,850
not necessarily the
size although both can

254
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:49,270
happen that's normal
that's supposed to

255
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:51,450
happen your breasts are
supposed to come out

256
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:55,310
of puberty and in
pregnancy they get bigger

257
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:58,410
because of the increase
in mother's milk

258
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:04,670
pathologically what
could it mean well there

259
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,730
are things like
endometrial hyperplasia

260
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,230
which means that the
lining of the uterus is

261
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,290
going to be thicker
and that should not

262
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:15,610
happen so it's response
it's an inappropriate

263
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:21,330
or excessive hormonal
situation BPH which

264
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:23,390
is what the gentleman
had the first case

265
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:26,650
benign prostatic hyperplasia
means there's more

266
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:31,670
um cells present now
hyperplasia is not in

267
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,910
and of itself cancer
it's not even really

268
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,810
pre-cancer you can't
really call it that

269
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:38,910
however and I want you
to realize this increased

270
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:41,490
cell division that
you know you're

271
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:44,170
dividing the cells there's
more cells coming and

272
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:45,810
that means there's
an increased risk of

273
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:48,970
getting genetic
aberrations because and if

274
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:51,380
that happens you can that
can drive proliferation

275
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,570
that's unrestrained
and give rise to

276
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:57,090
cancer so it's not
cancer but hyperplasia

277
00:12:57,090 --> 00:13:02,470
needs to be taken care
of okay here is a picture

278
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:05,870
of a heart obviously
um cross-section on

279
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:08,990
the left is a cellular
adaptation not now

280
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,490
we're not looking at
micros we're looking

281
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:12,470
at gross pictures and
that's a hypertrophy

282
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:14,930
of the heart and as
compared to the normal

283
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:16,470
heart and I know that's
a little bit smaller

284
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:18,330
in the picture but the
heart left ventricle

285
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:21,010
shouldn't be more than
1.5 centimeters so

286
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:23,310
whatever this person
has is causing left

287
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:28,410
ventricular hypertrophy
now why is this called

288
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:30,990
hypertrophy and why
is the heart not going

289
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:33,370
to have hyperplasia
and that goes back to

290
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:34,810
what I was talking
about that permanent

291
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:37,770
tissue for our intents
and purposes permanent

292
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:40,530
tissue includes cardiac
muscle, skeletal

293
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:43,050
muscle, and nerve tissue
because those generally

294
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:45,890
do not regenerate.
Now I know that there

295
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:47,640
are new things coming
out and they're

296
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,150
regenerating nerve tissue
etc but for our purposes

297
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:53,850
for traditional
definitions of tissue

298
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:56,730
these three especially
are permanent tissue

299
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,550
and we'll talk more about

300
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:00,050
that in healing
and repair.

301
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,730
So let's go on to
another case we've got

302
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:06,910
a 70 year old woman
this time who has a

303
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:09,070
hysterectomy because
she has benign smooth

304
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:11,550
muscle tumors which
are known as myomyoma

305
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:16,650
also fibroids the
uterus is small and it

306
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:19,890
has no other visible
pathology or as we say

307
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:22,670
gross pathology in
processing the uterus

308
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:25,690
they take a sample of
the endometrium and

309
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:28,670
what do they see
they see this on the

310
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:31,020
left hand side with
the blue arrow this

311
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:34,690
again is glandular
epithelium that should

312
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:38,590
be columnar uh it's
not squamous um and

313
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:40,650
it does that because
the you know the

314
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:43,510
endometrial lining
secretes things and also

315
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:45,670
it gets sloughed off
when menstruation

316
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:50,130
now whether this is
physiologically pathologic

317
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:53,050
it can be kind of
debated this is a

318
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:56,150
woman who know what is
postmenopausal so she

319
00:14:56,150 --> 00:15:00,830
is normally would not
have um hormone uh

320
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:03,930
secretion that would
make her that would um

321
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:06,590
increase the lining of
the uterus because she

322
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:09,590
cannot get pregnant
anymore on the right

323
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:11,210
you see the normal
and I think what you

324
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,990
notice is that I hope
that and again it's a

325
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:16,170
different stain I
realize that and that's

326
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:18,070
because a lot is I showed
you because a lot of

327
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:19,700
different stains look
at different color

328
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,810
actually it's the same
stain but it looks

329
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:24,490
different because of
the characteristic of

330
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,130
the picture on the
right the normal shows a

331
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:29,670
lot more round tubular
structures or glands

332
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:32,910
than the left okay so
what do we call this

333
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:36,030
adaptation this is
called atrophy it's a

334
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:38,530
reduction in the size
due to a decrease in

335
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:41,990
the cell size and
number because there's

336
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:44,250
decreased protein
synthesis and increased

337
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:47,610
protein degradation like
the others there could

338
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:50,790
be physiologic or
pathologic uh normal

339
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:54,350
development um sometimes
uh you get atrophy

340
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:56,390
and the uterus postpartum
you want it to go

341
00:15:56,390 --> 00:16:00,890
back down you want the
um the uh the uterus

342
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:03,610
to be back to normal
so that's atrophy but

343
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:06,110
pathologic um there's
a lot of reasons for

344
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:08,670
pathologic astrophobia
and that includes

345
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:11,410
a decreased workload
you're not using your

346
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:14,080
muscles so you just
use atrophy deneration

347
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:18,090
uh decreased blood
supply because that

348
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:21,250
supplies oxygen if you
don't get oxygen the the

349
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:24,470
tissue cannot grow
or cannot you know be

350
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:27,830
fed decrease nutrition
in general and decrease

351
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:30,070
hormone stimulation
also pressure you

352
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:32,010
can get pressure atrophy
something if you have

353
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:34,690
a tumor that's benign
but it's huge and

354
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:36,810
it's pressing upon some
other internal organ

355
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:39,430
it can that organ can
become atrophic okay

356
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:42,910
so that's atrophy and
what happens is in

357
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:46,170
atrophy there's trophic
signals that are

358
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:49,030
reduced and it's the
opposite of hypertrophy

359
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:51,350
so you get a decrease
in protein synthesis

360
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,170
how does this happen
they talk about the

361
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:57,810
ubiquitin proteasome
pathway that's where

362
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:00,190
most of the that's
how degradation of the

363
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:02,850
proteins happen in the
cell they have these

364
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:05,330
things called these
enzymes the ubiquitin

365
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:08,130
ligases are activated
by disuse and

366
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:11,270
nutritional deficits and
the ligases will attach

367
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:15,570
to this ubiquitin
and I'm sorry the

368
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:18,330
ligases will attach
ubiquitin to the proteins

369
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:21,250
targeting them and
and they're being

370
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:24,030
targeted for degradation
in the proteasomes.

371
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,650
A lot of times we'll
talk about this a little

372
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:29,430
bit later atrophy can
be accompanied with

373
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:32,010
autophagy which is
basically a cell that's

374
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:35,370
starving eats itself
because to decrease

375
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:39,330
nutrient demands okay
so now this is a really

376
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:40,810
important concept
we're going to go into

377
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,770
this is the last of
the adaptations i'm

378
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,830
going to talk about
which is metaplasia oh i

379
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,750
said that already all
right well this is a

380
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,910
little bit harder this
this um this case 52

381
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:52,770
year old man presents
with a six month

382
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:56,350
history of heartburn last
year he had reflux uh

383
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:58,270
diagnosed with reflux
esophagitis that

384
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:01,610
means that acid was
going back into esophagus

385
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:04,150
from the stomach and
that of course causes

386
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:06,250
feelings of heartburn
and things like that

387
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:08,790
they do an endoscopy
and there's an

388
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,890
irregular g-e junction
we really don't

389
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:12,570
want to have an
irregular g-e junction

390
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:14,110
but there's no
masses so there's no

391
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:17,930
cancer okay so again
on the left side

392
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:21,070
of this photo is
stratified squamous

393
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:23,390
that is the normal
epithelium of the

394
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:27,980
esophagus why i alluded
to this earlier and

395
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,890
this is because the
stratified squamous

396
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:31,890
is protective when
the bolus of food

397
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:34,170
comes down from the
mouth to the stomach.

398
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:37,310
On the right hand
side however this is

399
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:39,410
like the G-junction
but there's something

400
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,110
abnormal about
it. Although this

401
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:43,130
glandular epithelium,
those are columnar

402
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:46,310
cells, they've also
got big nuisance vacals

403
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:48,090
in them, some areas
that look pale.

404
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:50,870
That's called
intestinalization. It almost

405
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:53,710
looks like intestinal
rather than stomach.

406
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:57,930
So we have two types
of epithelium and what

407
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:00,870
is going on here and
it's going on right

408
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,890
near the junction I
think there's a long

409
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:04,950
thin arrow though it's
not as good but that's

410
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:07,130
kind of where the
junction and this is a

411
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:09,610
very important process
called metaplasia.

412
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:12,330
Metaplasia is
reversible I do want

413
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:14,130
to emphasize that
and it means that

414
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:15,990
there's one
differentiated cell type

415
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:17,730
that was replaced
by another one

416
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,550
why would that
happen again this is

417
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:23,650
adaptive one cell type
is sensitive to some

418
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:26,310
stress is replaced
by another one that's

419
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:29,050
better able to
withstand the stress so

420
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:32,930
in the case of the
esophagus getting acid

421
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:35,810
reflux the although
the stratified

422
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:37,770
squamous is protective
it's not protective

423
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:40,850
enough but by causing
the cells to turn

424
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:44,410
into an intestinal
cell or producing mucin

425
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:48,450
the mucin will buffer
or neutralize the

426
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:50,730
acid and that's how
it protects itself

427
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,850
but and this is the
big but even though

428
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:56,410
it's reversible
it if it keeps if

429
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:58,310
the stimulus keeps
there you can get

430
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:01,410
to dysplasia and
then cancer and so

431
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:03,390
metaplasia is
important to remember

432
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:06,470
the most common
metaplasia most common

433
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:08,810
tissue type is columnar
disquamous but there's

434
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:11,100
a lot of others and
I have a table later

435
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:14,550
to show you results
this results from

436
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:18,490
either reprogramming
of stem cells that

437
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:21,670
are local or colonization
by different cell

438
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:24,550
populations from sites
that are adjacent

439
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,910
and like a lot of things
i've been mentioning

440
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:28,790
it's stimulated by
signals that are

441
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:31,370
generated by growth
factors cytokines etc

442
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:35,530
so again i don't
expect you to know this

443
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:38,200
uh by just looking at
this is metoplastic

444
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,610
bronchoepithelium what
is normal is the question

445
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:43,570
now if you remember
or maybe you did

446
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:46,310
not get this yet the
bronchial epithelium the

447
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:49,190
upper respiratory tract
has as I mentioned

448
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:52,040
a little bit earlier
pseudo stratified

449
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:55,590
columnar epithelium with
cilia I don't see any

450
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:58,270
cilia here and this does
this looks stratified

451
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:01,210
but it's not columnar
it's actually

452
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:05,450
squamous so this is a
columnar epithelium having

453
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:08,330
gone to squamous why
would it do this in

454
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:11,230
the trachea in the
bronchus oh the upper

455
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:14,490
bronchi because if
you're a ****** the smoke

456
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:18,130
is going to irritate the
mucosa and it's going

457
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:20,390
to become metaplastic
and the squamous in

458
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:23,170
this case is more
protective okay this is

459
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:26,790
smoke that's an irritant
not acid that that

460
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:30,570
needs to be neutralized
this is another case

461
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:33,140
which is kind of
interesting again I don't

462
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,670
I hope maybe you
can see that this is

463
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:38,010
squamous epithelium and
I do have the keratin

464
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:40,370
labeled but the point
is this is a bladder

465
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:44,630
and if you remember bladder
should be transitional

466
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:46,710
epithelium
transitional epithelium

467
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:48,950
you can go back and stop
the tape and go back

468
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,990
to what it's supposed
to look like it it's

469
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:53,490
it's transitions it
changes because the

470
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:56,250
bladder has to go is
distended or it shrinks

471
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,560
depending on how much
urine you have in it so

472
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:03,650
this case the transitional
epithelium has

473
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:06,710
has become metaplastic
to squamous

474
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:10,890
why would that happen
there's two main

475
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:12,370
reasons but there
could be a lot of

476
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:14,730
other reasons but
one is bladder stones

477
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:16,770
if you have stones
in your bladder

478
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:19,030
and they're not
coming out and they're

479
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:22,210
irritating the transitional
mucosa again it will

480
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:24,870
become squamous with
keratin because it needs

481
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:28,630
to protect that mucosa
another thing is

482
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:31,270
certain infections with
schistosoma in certain

483
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:33,310
parts of the world
can lead to this as

484
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:38,010
well again the metaplasia
is adaptive this is

485
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:42,150
uh the endocervical and
the ectocervical area

486
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:43,910
and this is important
there's a transformation

487
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:46,250
zone where it's
supposed to go from

488
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:49,530
columnar on the left to
squamous on the right

489
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:53,490
but in the transformation
zone that's where

490
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:55,630
you go to get in the
pap smears they try

491
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:57,290
to get cells from there
that's where cancer

492
00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:59,250
can start and that
can cancer can start

493
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:01,950
there because metaprasia
starts there okay

494
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:06,430
so in this case the
squamous metaprasia um

495
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:08,890
where the blue arrows
are and that is

496
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:13,590
protective uh among other
things as a woman uh

497
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:17,070
ages there's ph
changes there might be

498
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:19,110
infections they have
babies things like that

499
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:22,810
so as time goes on
uh this might happen

500
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:25,470
squamous metaplasia is
kind of normal here but

501
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:28,110
you want to make sure
that's why women get

502
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:30,090
pap smears every
year that it does not

503
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:36,630
become dysplasia or
become cancer so this is

504
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:39,110
a picture of metaplasia
of columnar to

505
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:41,670
squamous epithelium i'm
repeating myself i do

506
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:45,010
that a lot just to
make it stick and so

507
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:47,390
you see on the top the
cartoon and you see

508
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:49,720
on the bottom what it
really looks like from

509
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,070
columnar to squamous.
I'm not really sure

510
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:55,430
where this is. It's
probably long, I'm not

511
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:57,450
sure, but that's not
the point. The point

512
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:59,630
is you've got two types
of epithelium, and

513
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:02,430
it's changing because
it needs to adapt.

514
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:05,470
This is a nice table
to keep in mind,

515
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:07,790
and we went through
all these already.

516
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:10,050
Cigarette smoke can
cause menoplasia

517
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:11,650
in the upper
respiratory tract, to

518
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:14,250
squamous epithelium,
the bladder stone,

519
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:16,010
the Barrett's
esophagus, and the

520
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:17,670
******. So keep
this table in mind.

521
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:18,750
I think it's
important, and it

522
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,510
can happen in
other tissue types.

523
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:25,610
So to review
the adaptations

524
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:31,310
they have
normal, atrophy,

525
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:33,070
hypertrophy,
and hyperplasia.

526
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:35,290
And there's a
cartoon here

527
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:37,410
and metaplasia
on the bottom.

528
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:42,390
Okay now let's go to
cell injury and there

529
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:45,090
are many ways cells
can be injured this is

530
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:49,390
just a few hypoxia
means decrease oxygen

531
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:52,590
usually via decreased
blood flow or anemia

532
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:55,910
physical things like trauma
radiation electricity

533
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:59,190
chemicals infections
with microbes like

534
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:03,510
bacteria fungi viruses
immunological reactions

535
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:06,990
all of this can cause
injury to cells to

536
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:11,450
tissue etc now this
slide i want you guys to

537
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:13,750
just look at and keep
going because this

538
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:15,710
is, I'm not going to
test you on this slide,

539
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:17,250
this is something
they put in the

540
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:19,470
book about what
happens to cells or

541
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:21,610
what happens in
response to injury.

542
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:24,770
Well there's, they
figured out between the

543
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:27,950
two editions, the one
five years ago now,

544
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:29,650
that there's three
different types of kind

545
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:32,070
of responses or
pathways, the integrated

546
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:34,630
stress response, the
unfolded protein response,

547
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:36,410
and autofagy. The
only one I really want

548
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:39,280
to talk about here
is autofagy because

549
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,990
that's, I mentioned
earlier is when the cell

550
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:44,230
eats its own contents
because its response

551
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:46,010
it could be response
to stress in a

552
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:50,110
physiological state like
aging or in pathology

553
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:54,550
like in hypoxia etc
and the whole thing is

554
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:58,990
the formation of this
autophagosome that's

555
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:01,610
a vesicle from the
isolation membrane which

556
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:03,710
is known as a phagophore
and that's where

557
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:06,510
all this organelles
and structures are

558
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:10,230
sequestered and And as
it matures, it's fused

559
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:13,990
with lysosomes, and
there's digestive enzymes

560
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:15,750
in there, and they
degrade it. So they

561
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:18,490
kill this out, and
that can be protective.

562
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,830
Okay, so let's talk about

563
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,610
cellular injury a
little bit more,

564
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:27,270
and reversible and
irreversible. This is

565
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:29,330
a 58-year-old man
who has a history of

566
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:31,670
unstable angina, who
presents shortness

567
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:33,710
of breath and chest
pain and sweating.

568
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:36,810
um the question is
that within 30 minutes

569
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:39,750
it could be 20 minutes
too uh what reversible

570
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:42,150
changes may take place
in the myocardial

571
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:44,610
area that's supplied
by the coronary artery

572
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:46,570
which is being occluded
by a thrombus so

573
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:48,150
it's telling you what's
happening here that

574
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:51,240
there's hypoxia because
the artery that's

575
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,240
supplying that area
is being blocked it

576
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:57,650
doesn't die right away
there's first there's

577
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:59,770
reversible change now
which one of these five

578
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:03,450
is reversible now of
course this is way I

579
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:05,470
introduce the subject
so unless you write

580
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:07,080
ahead you're not going
to know the answer.

581
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,210
The answer to this
is going to be

582
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:12,410
C as in Charlie
cellular swelling.

583
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:15,350
The others are not
reversible and we'll

584
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:16,830
talk about the
others especially the

585
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:19,230
first two in this
lecture and the last two

586
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:21,770
in the healing lecture.

587
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:25,230
So this is a picture
of kidney tubules.

588
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:27,810
Cellular swelling and
I want to make this

589
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:30,710
clear cellular swelling
is usually the earliest

590
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:34,010
manifestation of
cell injury at least

591
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:37,290
microscopically and you
can see vacuoles in the

592
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:40,110
cytoplasm and it's
also known as hydropic

593
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:43,770
change or vascular
degeneration also you'll

594
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:46,710
notice that it's a little
pinker theosinophilia

595
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:50,570
because this one in
this case is progressing

596
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:53,010
to acute tubular
necrosis of the kidney

597
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:56,330
but the swelling is
acute and reversible

598
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:59,510
to approximately 30
minutes now i mean it's

599
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:01,590
not exact it could
be 20 minutes 35

600
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:03,850
minutes the point is
it's a short period of

601
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:05,650
time which is why you
brush people to the

602
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:07,670
hospital they're having
a heart attack so

603
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:10,690
what's going on here
well in this case

604
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:13,770
ischemia there's a low
blood supply to the

605
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:17,230
kidney in this case
uh it causes with any

606
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:19,290
ischemia to any organ
causes decreased

607
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:22,210
oxidative phosphorylation
and therefore decreased

608
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:25,270
ATP so what's going
to happen well

609
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:27,710
you don't have energy
now ATP and that's

610
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:29,900
going to decrease the
function of the sodium

611
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:32,510
potassium pump so
what's going to happen

612
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,690
is you're going to
have influx of sodium

613
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:37,910
and water is going to
fall which means they're

614
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:39,490
going to have swelling
or edema now it

615
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:42,450
says influx of calcium
that comes later that

616
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:44,570
that's still that
would not be reversible

617
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:46,170
so i shouldn't really
put calcium in there

618
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:48,230
but the sodium and the
water are important.

619
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:52,010
So let's continue this
patient goes to the

620
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:54,690
hospital one hour after
he has the symptoms.

621
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:58,450
EKG shows that he's
having an MI and they

622
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:00,770
have myocardial enzymes
that you'll learn about

623
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:03,850
that are consistent
from the diagnosis and

624
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:06,490
this is what you can see
under that microscope

625
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:08,790
and I hope this
looks like a mess to

626
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,850
you because it looks
like a mess to me. It's

627
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:13,070
very disorganized and
the only thing really

628
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:16,130
you can see is these
dark cells and those are

629
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:21,590
basically dying nuclei
okay so the nuclei

630
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:24,670
become shrunken they're
dark that's pycnosis

631
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,930
there's also carrier
axis that's fragmentation

632
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:31,150
of the nucleus and
carrier lysis or

633
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:34,750
dissolution and those
are all greek terms and

634
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:37,750
within time you know
the nucleus is going to

635
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:40,530
be gone but it'll be
the tissue will be dead

636
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:43,990
before that okay but
the nucleus will then

637
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,270
should be gone and
we'll talk a little bit

638
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:48,280
more about that in
a bit so this is not

639
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:51,430
necessarily a this is
all what's going on okay

640
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:55,970
from from the the first
two okay the first

641
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:58,250
two bullet points are
going to be reversible

642
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:02,590
basically um you can have
oxypedic phosphorylation

643
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:05,090
decrease or damage
and decrease ATP

644
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:08,170
at first, which what
it will happen is, as I

645
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:09,750
mentioned, to reduce
the sodium potassium

646
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:12,630
bump, and you're going
to get cell swelling.

647
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:14,190
That's reversible.

648
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:15,970
But after some time, like

649
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:17,310
30 minutes, for example,

650
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:19,750
you'll get an
increase in anaerobic

651
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:21,310
glycolysis. And we'll
talk a little bit

652
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:23,770
more in detail about
this, which decreases

653
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:26,150
glycogen, and that
increases lactic

654
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:28,690
acid, and you get
decreased pH, and that

655
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:30,890
causes chromatin
in the DNA decline.

656
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:33,550
Protein synthesis is
going to be decreased.

657
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:36,110
The cell is dying and
the calcium pump is

658
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:39,290
important here because
calcium then enters the

659
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:41,830
cell and I have pictures
of this so don't

660
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:45,930
worry and causes activation
of a lot of different

661
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:48,910
enzymes listed here
and all those enzymes

662
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:51,510
do they break things
up and that's going

663
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:54,550
to cause membrane damage
and DNA damage etc.

664
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:59,590
And then finally as
everything gets destroyed

665
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:03,150
and there's digestion
of the cell uh the

666
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:05,670
contents will leak out
and elicit inflammation

667
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:07,830
which is the topic
of the next lecture

668
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:10,590
now this is not autophagy
because autophagy

669
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:12,770
is when the cell does
it to itself this is

670
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:15,250
because there's been
hypoxia or some kind

671
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:18,510
of injury so let's
talk a little bit more

672
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,950
in details about these
mechanisms of cell

673
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:24,330
death slash injury and
like it's a spectrum

674
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:26,710
you know i mean reversible
and irreversible

675
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:30,910
there's not one time
you know one minute

676
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:35,970
but it is notably around
30 minutes could be

677
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:39,870
less or more but
notably so we already

678
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:42,750
mentioned atp depletion
and what happens is

679
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:45,150
that the mitochondrial
membrane when the

680
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:47,630
atp gets depleted
forms a mitochondrial

681
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:50,990
permeability transition
pore when that pore

682
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:55,850
opens the there's a loss
of membrane potential

683
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:58,530
mitochondria and you
get the failure more

684
00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:00,890
failure of oxidation
phosphorylation more

685
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:02,930
ATP depletion and
we've already talked

686
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:05,710
about the plasma
membrane energy dependent

687
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:09,890
sodium pump at the
sodium potassium pump and

688
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:13,080
that will cause reduced
so I mean reduces

689
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:16,310
the the action of that
pump and it causes

690
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:19,150
sodium to enter inside
the cell it shouldn't

691
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:21,110
be inside the cell
remember sodium is

692
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:25,130
usually out potassium
in and um accumulation

693
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:30,210
um of water by osmotic
drive okay because

694
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:33,430
water follows sodium
that's a big thing so

695
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:36,450
you get cell swelling
okay now i talked

696
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:38,110
to you know again you
don't have to read this

697
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:40,210
in detail the point
is that i mentioned

698
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:43,750
glycolysis um you know
because there's no

699
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:46,130
atp there's no energy
the body's going to want

700
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,030
to use like or the
cells are going to want

701
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:50,710
to use their glycogen
stores they're depleted

702
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:53,550
and when glycolysis
happens under anaerobic

703
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:56,070
conditions you get
lactic acid so that

704
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:58,170
will decrease the
intercellular ph which will

705
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:02,430
cause uh dna problems
um decrease activity

706
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:06,050
of the enzymes in the
cystus in the cell

707
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:09,810
itself but at this is
the point where things

708
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:13,030
become dangerously bad
and you're irreversible

709
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:16,510
damage and the
mitochondria the membranes

710
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:19,550
they're all dead and
that's necrosis we're

711
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:21,070
going to talk about
the calcium pump what

712
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:24,350
i did mention and that
contributes to necrosis

713
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:26,150
because it breaks
down a lot of things

714
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:29,510
the calcium is a secondary
messenger and also

715
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:31,770
we'll talk about the
last point which is

716
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:35,890
formation of a reaction
oxygen species which

717
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:39,670
can happen when you have
incomplete oxidative

718
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:43,270
phosphorylation so
that was mitochondrial

719
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:45,430
damage what about the
membrane of the cell

720
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:48,090
well if you're going
to lose the membrane

721
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:50,770
you have damage that's
going to affect a lot

722
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:52,390
of things the integrity
and the function

723
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:57,430
of the cell and again
it can be the result

724
00:33:57,430 --> 00:34:00,730
and it usually is of
ATP depletion and the

725
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:04,330
calcium mediated activation
of phospholipases.

726
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:06,430
Remember what cell
membranes are made of.

727
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:09,150
Also, plasma membranes
can be damaged

728
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:11,890
directly from toxins
from bacteria or

729
00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:14,330
viral proteins, etc,
etc. So it doesn't

730
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:16,150
always have to be
as a result of ATP

731
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:18,150
depletion, they could
be damaged directly

732
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,850
by things like
chemical, physical,

733
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:20,930
bacterial.

734
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:23,670
Reaction oxygen
species are oxygen free

735
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:27,170
radicals that cause injury
to cell membranes by

736
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:31,230
lipid peroxidation.
And when that happens

737
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:33,510
when there's membrane
of mitochondrial damage

738
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:36,090
we're going to have a
decrease in phospholipid

739
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:37,870
synthesis and
membrane damage and

740
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:42,130
increase in phospholipid
breakdown and basically

741
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:45,330
what's happening is
the calcium severe cell

742
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:48,130
injury is associated
with these degradation

743
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:50,870
because there's
activation of the calcium

744
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:54,030
dependent phospholite
bases because the

745
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:56,810
calcium has increased
and it's going to be a

746
00:34:56,810 --> 00:35:00,450
secondary messenger
that does a lot of the

747
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:03,530
enzyme reactions we'll
talk about in a second

748
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:06,950
cytoskeletal filaments
kind of anchor

749
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:09,170
connect the plasma
membrane to the interior

750
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:11,890
so if they become
abnormal you're going

751
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:15,210
to get stretching and
and rupture and the

752
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:18,950
cell is dead again
this is a pictorial

753
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,910
image of what i just
said so if you prefer

754
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:23,830
the image you can
take a look at this

755
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:25,690
It basically said
what I just said,

756
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:27,490
it may have a few
extra things in it.

757
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:31,970
So just to mention,
again, this is one

758
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:33,830
other slide, which I'm
just giving you some

759
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:35,630
background information.
I'm not going to

760
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:37,810
test you on this, I'm
going to assume some

761
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:40,070
knowledge of it, but
I'm not going to ask

762
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:42,870
you for formulas or
anything like that.

763
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:45,290
Free radicals, as you
know, are unstable,

764
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:48,970
they decay spontaneously,
but normally cells

765
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:52,170
do have mechanisms
both enzymatic and non

766
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:56,130
-enzymatic to remove
the free radicals and a

767
00:35:56,130 --> 00:36:01,550
couple of them include
antioxidants in the

768
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:05,550
the binding of iron
and copper to transport

769
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:08,890
proteins that's how
it protects itself and

770
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:12,130
enzymes that act as
radical scavenging systems

771
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:15,030
like the ones listed
catalase etc again

772
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:17,250
i just want to bring
that back into your

773
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:20,690
memory so this is a slide
that you can you know

774
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:22,910
i'm not putting on
any exam but somebody

775
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:25,730
else may you know and
this is a picture of

776
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:28,890
what i just said okay
so here's an image i

777
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:31,030
think it's helpful if
you want to take a look

778
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:34,330
at that i want to
bring back the calcium

779
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:39,510
problem because it's
big um calcium ions as

780
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:41,870
i mentioned or alluded
to act as secondary

781
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:45,690
messengers in many
pathways but if they're

782
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:48,330
excessive in the cell
they can cause injury

783
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:52,190
ischemia toxins can
cause an excessive

784
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:54,390
increase in the
calcium in the cell

785
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:56,650
because first
there's release from

786
00:36:56,650 --> 00:37:00,050
intercellular stores and
later there's increased

787
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:02,210
influx across the
plasma membrane

788
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:05,990
so the calcium pump
fails this is not

789
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:09,850
good because you're
going to basically

790
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:12,970
activate enzymes,
and those enzymes are

791
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:15,290
going to damage
things. So the enzymes

792
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:17,550
include the four
listed here and others,

793
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:20,210
phospholipases,
proteases, and these

794
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:23,430
all cause damage to
the cell, which it

795
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:25,510
cannot survive,
okay, especially

796
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:28,090
endonucleases, which
will break down DNA.

797
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:31,510
This is necrosis
happening.

798
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:37,090
So on the left here
is a picture of what I

799
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:38,930
have been saying,
that's ischemia, there's

800
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:42,470
a blockage and it's um
oxidative phosphorylation

801
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:44,350
goes down and the
mitochondria remember

802
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:47,510
that's the uh the
workhouse uh atp goes

803
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:50,450
down and you have all
these consequences okay

804
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:55,010
um the big one on the
left is the reversible

805
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:59,270
one the sodium pump
and um the efl the

806
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:01,730
sodium going down
calcium will start

807
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:04,810
influxing but not till
later do the enzymes

808
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:08,390
get um activated so
then the anaerobic

809
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:12,670
glycolysis which decreases
the ph etc on the

810
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:14,970
right is the illustration
of the calcium

811
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:17,730
extracellular calcium
going intracellularly

812
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:19,150
not a good thing
because it activates

813
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:22,110
the enzymes and as
you can see from

814
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:25,830
the picture their
enzymes can when you

815
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:27,330
activate them they're
going to eat up things

816
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:29,150
like the membrane
and the nucleus and

817
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:31,250
that of course is
not good for the cell

818
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:34,150
one thing that they've
learned you know

819
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:36,710
again fine line
between reversible and

820
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:38,150
irreversible but
one thing that's

821
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:41,570
consistently found in
irreversible damage

822
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:44,650
is the inability to
reverse the mitochondrial

823
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:46,890
dysfunction you
don't have oxidative

824
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:49,370
phosphorylation
and atp generation

825
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:52,990
that and any
profound problem or

826
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:54,790
disturbance in the
membrane function

827
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:59,410
it these are
characteristic of necrosis

828
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,290
and that's where
we're going to

829
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:03,070
so cell injury now
we're talking about

830
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:05,550
necrosis which is
cell death this

831
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:08,530
is always a pathological
process okay

832
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:11,650
um the main causes
there are a lot of

833
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:13,430
causes but they're
listed here as like

834
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:16,950
ischemia is a big one
uh toxins burns etc

835
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:21,610
Necrosis is characterized
microscopically

836
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:23,850
by denaturation
of cellular

837
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:26,270
proteins which makes
things look pinker.

838
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:29,570
Leakage of cell
contents through

839
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:31,310
the membranes
that are damaged

840
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:33,450
and that inflammation
is elicited.

841
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:37,430
And of course
enzymatic cell dies and

842
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:39,530
digest itself
basically. Again that's

843
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:41,650
not autophagy. Autophagy
is when it does

844
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:43,890
it on purpose. This
is not on purpose.

845
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:48,570
when the cellular
contents leak out they

846
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:51,310
do elicit an inflammatory
response again

847
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:53,690
that will be the topic
of the next lecture

848
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:56,790
okay so we have a
picture here now we've

849
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:59,230
talked about what necrosis
is we have a picture

850
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:02,010
here of necrosis
okay but there's

851
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:03,830
different patterns
in necrosis different

852
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:07,170
morphological patterns on
the left here is normal

853
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:09,070
myocardium I don't
expect you to necessarily

854
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:10,510
recognize it but
But I hope you can

855
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:13,010
see left to right,
they're very different.

856
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:15,110
Right is a lot different
looking than the

857
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:18,510
left. And this is
ischemia of myocardium.

858
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:21,850
Look how really
bright pink-red the

859
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:23,810
cells are there on
the bottom of the

860
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:26,870
right hand picture
and the pycnosis

861
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:29,210
that's developing and
all this other stuff

862
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:31,110
that's developing
microscopically.

863
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:33,870
That is known as
coagulative necrosis. That's

864
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:35,990
one of the main patterns
of necrosis that

865
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:38,190
you should really
know. and in coagulant

866
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:40,690
necrosis the cell outlines
or the architecture

867
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:44,450
usually are preserved
at least for a while

868
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:47,610
but the nucleus is
gone it disappears.

869
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:50,310
There's also going to
be initially some really

870
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:53,370
pink red looking
cytoplasm because of the

871
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:55,260
denaturing of the
protein so you get

872
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:58,850
eosinophilia and when we
talk about a local area

873
00:40:58,850 --> 00:41:01,490
of coagulant necrosis
we call that an infarct

874
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:04,390
such as a myocardial
effect this happens

875
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:07,490
in most organs that
are solid by solid I

876
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:09,770
don't mean the organ
has to be solid I mean

877
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:12,830
things like um you know
the kidney the liver

878
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:16,510
even in in the bladder
wall or you can have

879
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:19,330
ischemia in the intestines
obviously they're

880
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:23,090
not solid but the
the the wall is solid

881
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:26,010
so for the most part
coagulant necrosis

882
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:28,490
happens the other pattern
that can happen there's

883
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:30,810
four five patterns
is this pattern and

884
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:32,870
hopefully you recognize
in the top left this

885
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:36,610
is a what organ this is
a brain and something's

886
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:38,070
a little bit weird
with this brain

887
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:40,690
because it's got this
cavity that looks like

888
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:43,850
there's liquid in it
and it's all if you this

889
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:45,650
is mushy i know you
can't tell that by the

890
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:48,590
picture normally you
see what it looks like

891
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:51,770
on top those are you
know neurons microglia

892
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:55,110
etc but microscopically
what you're going

893
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:58,790
to see in the brain
is this on the bottom

894
00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:01,250
which is a lot of white
space and a lot of

895
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:04,930
things eating up things
and and again I don't

896
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:06,710
expect you to recognize
but this is necrosis

897
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:09,430
this is not normal but
it's not collagative

898
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:11,770
necrosis it's known
as liquefactive

899
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:14,890
necrosis and really
this only happens in the

900
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:18,490
brain sometimes pancreas
in other places too

901
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:21,650
pancreas will talk
about fat necrosis as

902
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:24,990
well abscesses are a big
example of liquefactive

903
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:27,260
necrosis so you get
dead cells that are

904
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:29,430
digested and it results
in a very liquid

905
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:34,070
viscous mass neutrophils
release lysosomal

906
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:37,670
enzyme and then they
digest the tissue okay so

907
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:39,630
when you think of a
brain when we talked

908
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:44,000
about ****** that's
liquefactive necrosis this

909
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,810
is another type of
necrosis that you should

910
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:48,150
keep in mind um on the
bottom is the gross

911
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:50,370
picture on the top is
microscopic and you

912
00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:53,730
see a really bland
pink middle area there

913
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:55,590
that doesn't look like
much of anything and

914
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:59,430
some big round cells
around it um and the

915
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:02,190
bottom i think i believe
that's lung tissue

916
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:05,510
whatever tissue it is
that big round nodule

917
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:07,650
is something known
as it's a chronic

918
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:10,170
inflammatory thing
known as a granuloma.

919
00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:13,010
This is known as
caceous necrosis. Not

920
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:15,090
all granulomas are
caceous, but this

921
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:18,350
particular is caceous
necrosis. Caceous comes

922
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:20,230
from the word cheese
-like, because when

923
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:22,050
you looked at that
module, it was kind

924
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:24,690
of white, friable,
almost cheesy looking.

925
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:27,150
And when you see
the area under the

926
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:29,790
microscope, the granuloma,
you'll see basically

927
00:43:29,790 --> 00:43:32,870
an amorphous area,
structureless collection

928
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:37,130
and it's enclosed by
a rim of macrophages

929
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:38,950
that are called
epithelioid because

930
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:41,390
they look a little bit
epithelial and a rim

931
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:44,150
of lymphocytes so it's
a nodular collection

932
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:46,650
and you can see
these as nodules when

933
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:48,890
they're big enough and
usually with caixous

934
00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:51,530
necrosis we talk
about tuberculosis and

935
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:53,590
fungal infections
those are the two big

936
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:55,910
things to remember
about caixous necrosis

937
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:57,950
here's another picture
of it with the labels

938
00:43:57,950 --> 00:44:01,530
um the necrosis look
you can't see anything

939
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:03,910
it's nothing it's
just pink stuff uh

940
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:06,490
the giant cells around
it and lymphocytes

941
00:44:08,590 --> 00:44:12,350
okay another pattern 68
year old male alcoholic

942
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:14,390
presents with mid
-epigastric abdominal

943
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:17,410
pain and nausea he has
elevated amylase and

944
00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:20,970
lipase level this man
is going through acute

945
00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:23,430
pancreatitis and here
we're going to talk

946
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:27,070
about fatty necrosis now
in fatty necrosis you

947
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:29,370
have fat destruction
so you have release

948
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:32,390
of lipase which is an
enzyme that breaks down

949
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:35,650
fatty acids so the
peripancreatic fat

950
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:38,830
especially is going to get
dissolved basically and

951
00:44:38,830 --> 00:44:41,530
that's fatty necrosis
another way the fatty

952
00:44:41,530 --> 00:44:44,510
necrosis can occur is
trauma to the breast

953
00:44:44,510 --> 00:44:46,350
for example trauma to
anything where there's

954
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:50,790
adipose tissue okay
um okay so the almost

955
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:52,570
the last type yeah
this is the last type

956
00:44:52,570 --> 00:44:55,650
fibrinoid necrosis is
usually seen in vessel

957
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:58,030
damage that's caused by
immune reaction so you

958
00:44:58,030 --> 00:45:00,750
get antigen antibody
deposits in the wall

959
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:04,130
as seen here and the
immune complexes combine

960
00:45:04,130 --> 00:45:07,910
with fibrin and you
get this bright pink

961
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:09,610
uh you're going to notice
a lot of things are

962
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:12,070
bright pink and amorphous
looking and this

963
00:45:12,070 --> 00:45:13,970
is usually a sign that
there's been a vascular

964
00:45:13,970 --> 00:45:17,000
damage vasculitis
usually and we call this

965
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,890
fibrinoid necrosis
because it looks like

966
00:45:18,890 --> 00:45:22,650
fiber and the pink stuff
i'm going to mention

967
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:24,630
gangrenous necrosis it's
not really a specific

968
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:26,530
pattern but i think
it should be mentioned

969
00:45:26,530 --> 00:45:28,590
you guys have heard
of gangrene you know

970
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:31,430
people who have a
limb that's lost blood

971
00:45:31,430 --> 00:45:34,390
supply and undergone
necrosis the skin the

972
00:45:34,390 --> 00:45:38,450
muscle whatever even
the bone that's gangrene

973
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:41,730
but when you have bacterial
infection superimposed

974
00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:43,300
on gangrene you're
going to get some

975
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:45,110
liquefactor necrosis
and you can get what's

976
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:47,250
known as wet gangrene
these are clinical terms

977
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:51,670
more rather than really
pathological okay

978
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:54,970
I would like to turn
to apoptosis which in

979
00:45:54,970 --> 00:45:57,150
the past wasn't always
given that much time

980
00:45:57,150 --> 00:45:59,270
but it's important to
know because apoptosis

981
00:45:59,270 --> 00:46:02,630
is a different type of
cell death this is a

982
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:04,590
program type of cell
death it's tightly

983
00:46:04,590 --> 00:46:08,110
regulated suicide program
so that the cells that

984
00:46:08,110 --> 00:46:11,070
are destined to die
will activate intrinsic

985
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:13,830
enzymes known as
caspases that's important

986
00:46:13,830 --> 00:46:17,290
to remember that
degrade cellular dna and

987
00:46:17,290 --> 00:46:22,030
proteins so mechanism of
death here is regulated

988
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:27,110
this is not autophagy
because the cell

989
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:31,510
is destroying itself
not to save necessarily

990
00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:35,910
because it's starved
okay this eliminates

991
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:38,870
cells that may be
irreparably damaged

992
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:42,070
etc and the big thing
are the caspases

993
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:44,250
the enzymes and you end
up with these things

994
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:47,130
called apoptotic
bodies that break up

995
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:50,490
into plasma membrane
brown fragments and

996
00:46:50,490 --> 00:46:52,830
those have parts of
cytoplasma nucleus

997
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:55,350
in them. I want to
make a point that

998
00:46:55,350 --> 00:46:59,010
apoptosis can be normal
or could be pathological

999
00:46:59,010 --> 00:47:02,150
but necrosis is
always pathologic.

1000
00:47:02,710 --> 00:47:06,490
Let's talk about some
examples of normal

1001
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:09,230
versus pathological
apoptosis this is just a

1002
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:13,050
brief list here for
example when the embryo

1003
00:47:13,050 --> 00:47:15,290
is developing it has
webbed fingers and

1004
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:17,910
webbed toes that area
has to go away the

1005
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:20,590
webbed area so that's
that's normal that's

1006
00:47:20,590 --> 00:47:23,230
part of the normal uh
function and apoptosis

1007
00:47:23,230 --> 00:47:26,310
happens in the hormone
withdrawal involution

1008
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:28,890
and menstruation and
in a human inflammatory

1009
00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:32,210
response pathological
that's really

1010
00:47:32,210 --> 00:47:35,490
important because when
there's DNA damage

1011
00:47:35,490 --> 00:47:38,010
you want to protect
yourself because that DNA

1012
00:47:38,010 --> 00:47:41,970
damage can lead to
cancer so apoptosis

1013
00:47:41,970 --> 00:47:44,810
occurs to get rid of
those damaged cells and

1014
00:47:44,810 --> 00:47:47,550
also in infections
and misfolded proteins

1015
00:47:47,610 --> 00:47:50,450
so this is just a little
bit more and again

1016
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:52,370
it looks like a lot of
words but this slide

1017
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:53,990
and the next this
is on physiological

1018
00:47:54,170 --> 00:47:56,850
apoptosis and the next
one's on pathological

1019
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,270
I just want to emphasize
that physiological

1020
00:48:00,270 --> 00:48:03,970
apoptosis is normal
to eliminate cells

1021
00:48:03,970 --> 00:48:07,490
that aren't needed or
to maintain a constant

1022
00:48:07,490 --> 00:48:09,550
number of cells and
tissues and there

1023
00:48:09,550 --> 00:48:11,130
there are one two
three four five six

1024
00:48:11,130 --> 00:48:14,410
bullet points here
of things that can be

1025
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:17,050
considered physiologic
apoptosis I already

1026
00:48:17,050 --> 00:48:19,450
talked about supernumerary
cells too many

1027
00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:21,440
that have to be removed
during development

1028
00:48:21,710 --> 00:48:24,910
the menstrual cycle,
cell turnover,

1029
00:48:25,370 --> 00:48:27,690
big things, elimination
of lymphocytes

1030
00:48:27,690 --> 00:48:29,830
that don't produce
functional antigens.

1031
00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:31,950
So for example,
immature lymphocytes

1032
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:33,470
in the low marrow
and pharma and

1033
00:48:33,470 --> 00:48:35,230
general center B
cells, they have to

1034
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:38,550
become apoptotic or
things will go bad.

1035
00:48:38,970 --> 00:48:41,950
And for elimination
of harmful cell for

1036
00:48:41,950 --> 00:48:44,610
reactive lymphocytes. So
you know, autoimmunity,

1037
00:48:44,610 --> 00:48:47,090
you don't want
autoimmune diseases

1038
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:49,780
and that's why apoptosis
can be important.

1039
00:48:50,530 --> 00:48:52,210
it's also important
for the death of

1040
00:48:52,210 --> 00:48:55,530
host cells um that
already did their job

1041
00:48:55,530 --> 00:48:57,380
like neutrophils in
the acute inflammatory

1042
00:48:57,380 --> 00:48:59,210
response or
lymphocytes in the

1043
00:48:59,210 --> 00:49:04,530
immune response um
the the thing with um

1044
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:08,890
the physiological
apoptosis cancer and we'll

1045
00:49:08,890 --> 00:49:11,070
learn about this in a
couple more lectures

1046
00:49:11,070 --> 00:49:15,480
it can happen when
apoptosis is blocked

1047
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:18,850
because it cannot get
rid of the damaged cell

1048
00:49:18,850 --> 00:49:20,750
and so the damaged
cell survives so that's

1049
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:22,530
something for the
future to think about.

1050
00:49:22,990 --> 00:49:25,490
Pathologically the
apoptosis eliminates

1051
00:49:25,490 --> 00:49:27,570
cells that are
injured beyond repair

1052
00:49:27,570 --> 00:49:30,690
again it's in a
protective effect by

1053
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:32,880
preventing survival
of cells with DNA

1054
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,200
mutations that can go
on to be malignant.

1055
00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:38,430
Other things like
misfolded proteins

1056
00:49:38,430 --> 00:49:41,650
certain infections
um remember that

1057
00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:44,030
immunologically
speaking important host

1058
00:49:44,030 --> 00:49:46,030
response to viruses
are that the

1059
00:49:46,030 --> 00:49:49,250
cytotactic key lymphocytes
the ctls specific

1060
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:52,170
for viral proteins
induce apoptosis

1061
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:54,430
of the infected
cells because they

1062
00:49:54,430 --> 00:49:56,220
want to get rid of
the infection that

1063
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:58,270
happens also it
is responsible for

1064
00:49:58,270 --> 00:50:01,670
killing tumor so if
you block apoptosis

1065
00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:03,190
that's going to
be a problem okay

1066
00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:07,010
so what does it look
like how is it different

1067
00:50:07,010 --> 00:50:09,550
than necrosis well
they both have pygnosis

1068
00:50:09,550 --> 00:50:13,510
and cariexis but
and and yes this the

1069
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:16,190
cytoplasm is pink but
the cell it shrinks and

1070
00:50:16,190 --> 00:50:17,750
there's membrane
blubbing and I have a

1071
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:22,310
comparison picture coming
up there is no elicited

1072
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:24,270
inflammation and
that's very important

1073
00:50:24,270 --> 00:50:27,090
because you want to
limit damage in apoptosis

1074
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:30,250
so yes phagocytes
come in and phagocytes

1075
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:34,750
the apoptotic bodies but
there's no neutrophils

1076
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:38,470
this is an example
of an apoptotic body

1077
00:50:38,470 --> 00:50:41,790
it's very dark and
dense and it could be

1078
00:50:41,790 --> 00:50:43,990
in any place this
happens to be in the skin

1079
00:50:44,970 --> 00:50:47,870
and the mechanisms
involved are very complex

1080
00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:49,750
and I don't need you
to know them in detail

1081
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:52,310
I do want you to
remember that it's done

1082
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:55,850
by enzymes called
caspases that initially

1083
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,430
caspases get activated
and then cause a cascade

1084
00:51:00,430 --> 00:51:03,430
of other caspases and
then the execution

1085
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:06,490
phase is the terminal
caspase the last one

1086
00:51:06,490 --> 00:51:09,650
that will cause the
cellular fragmentation.

1087
00:51:09,730 --> 00:51:13,270
All of this is regulated
by pro and anti

1088
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:15,630
-apoptotic proteins.
There has to be a balance

1089
00:51:15,630 --> 00:51:18,090
and we'll talk a little
bit about that and

1090
00:51:18,090 --> 00:51:20,990
there are two distinct
pathways that converge

1091
00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:23,690
on the caspase
activation and I want to

1092
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:25,810
talk a little bit
about those but again i

1093
00:51:25,810 --> 00:51:28,310
don't need you to know
them in exquisite detail

1094
00:51:28,310 --> 00:51:30,770
although somebody else
may the mitochondrial

1095
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:32,510
pathway and the death
receptor pathway

1096
00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:35,610
these pathways will
intersect but generally

1097
00:51:36,110 --> 00:51:39,090
they are induced by
different conditions etc

1098
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:42,590
so in the intrinsic
mitochondrial pathway

1099
00:51:42,590 --> 00:51:44,390
here are a lot of words
but what do i want

1100
00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:47,590
you to know this
results from increased

1101
00:51:47,590 --> 00:51:51,270
permeability of the
mitochondrial outer membrane

1102
00:51:51,270 --> 00:51:55,030
and so what happens is
pro-apoptotic molecules

1103
00:51:55,030 --> 00:51:58,010
are released um one
example they give

1104
00:51:58,010 --> 00:52:02,750
is cytochrome c and so
when apoptosis happens

1105
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:04,990
it leads to these pro
-apoptotic proteins

1106
00:52:04,990 --> 00:52:09,670
leaving um and caspase
activation anti-apoptotic

1107
00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:12,290
proteins include
members of the bcl2

1108
00:52:12,290 --> 00:52:14,830
family which we'll talk
about at another time

1109
00:52:14,830 --> 00:52:18,170
um and this change of
proportion where you

1110
00:52:18,170 --> 00:52:21,610
have more pro-apoptotic
versus anti will lead

1111
00:52:21,610 --> 00:52:25,110
to apoptosis again
the important things

1112
00:52:25,110 --> 00:52:27,570
here are mitochondrial
permeability and cytochrome

1113
00:52:27,570 --> 00:52:30,450
c release if you
remember anything from

1114
00:52:30,450 --> 00:52:33,430
the slide is that
the um the intrinsic

1115
00:52:33,430 --> 00:52:36,610
mitochondrial pathway
is caspase 9 that's the

1116
00:52:36,610 --> 00:52:38,950
enzyme it's the critical
initiator you need

1117
00:52:38,950 --> 00:52:42,110
that to be initiated
it's initiated there's

1118
00:52:42,110 --> 00:52:46,470
an apoptosome this
form by interaction I

1119
00:52:46,470 --> 00:52:48,290
mentioned cytochrome c
and these other things

1120
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:51,870
that you do not need
to memorize now the

1121
00:52:51,870 --> 00:52:54,250
extrinsic or the death
receptor which sounds

1122
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:57,810
like death star pathway
is initiated by engaging

1123
00:52:57,810 --> 00:52:59,710
the plasma membrane
death receptors

1124
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:04,490
what's a death receptor
they're members of the

1125
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:09,070
tumor necrosis factor
receptor family they

1126
00:53:09,070 --> 00:53:12,170
have a domain in the
cytoplasm that involves

1127
00:53:12,170 --> 00:53:14,390
protein protein
interactions these are death

1128
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:17,570
domains that you need
to deliver signals for

1129
00:53:17,570 --> 00:53:20,470
apoptosis the best
known one the best

1130
00:53:20,470 --> 00:53:26,910
described is the FAS
related protein FAS it's in

1131
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:29,450
the book in excruciating
detail that I'm not

1132
00:53:29,450 --> 00:53:32,830
going to go into the
extrinsic apoptosis

1133
00:53:32,830 --> 00:53:35,890
pathway can be inhibited
as well by something

1134
00:53:35,890 --> 00:53:39,250
called a flip protein
the death receptor

1135
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:42,210
pathway really is
is important because
it eliminates

1136
00:53:42,210 --> 00:53:45,050
self-reactive
lymphocytes and is a

1137
00:53:45,050 --> 00:53:48,890
mechanism for cell
killing by cytotoxic
t lymphocytes

1138
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:51,570
so now the intrinsic
and the extrinsic

1139
00:53:51,570 --> 00:53:55,190
pathways converge and
you get activation of

1140
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:58,010
the of the executioner
you know so you've got

1141
00:53:58,010 --> 00:54:01,270
the caspase 9 but the
extrinsic is caspase

1142
00:54:01,270 --> 00:54:07,030
8 or 10 and that forms
you know this uh the

1143
00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:09,510
executioner caspases
which are 3 and 6. again

1144
00:54:09,510 --> 00:54:12,150
you don't need to know
the numbers so nine

1145
00:54:12,150 --> 00:54:14,870
just remember is the
intrinsic but it's a

1146
00:54:14,870 --> 00:54:17,270
whole cascade nine
is important for the

1147
00:54:17,270 --> 00:54:20,210
initiation and then finally
we got a cascade and

1148
00:54:20,210 --> 00:54:22,370
we become we need to
get rid of all these

1149
00:54:22,370 --> 00:54:25,090
enzymes are breaking
these downs you need to

1150
00:54:25,090 --> 00:54:27,030
get rid of the dead
cells that you put into

1151
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:30,050
bite-sized fragments
the apoptotic bodies and

1152
00:54:30,050 --> 00:54:32,050
sometimes those bodies
and we'll learn this

1153
00:54:32,050 --> 00:54:35,090
in information as well
they get coated with

1154
00:54:35,090 --> 00:54:39,310
antibodies in this
examples include some of

1155
00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:41,390
the complement system
and those antibodies

1156
00:54:41,390 --> 00:54:44,350
make them more susceptible
to being phagocytose

1157
00:54:44,350 --> 00:54:46,430
so they're and I thought
I made this up but

1158
00:54:46,430 --> 00:54:48,250
there are eight me
signals apparently the

1159
00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:50,810
book uses this term too
it's kind of like and

1160
00:54:50,810 --> 00:54:52,510
I don't know why I saw
we do this but it's

1161
00:54:52,510 --> 00:54:56,010
like telling it here
I am I'm going to you

1162
00:54:56,010 --> 00:54:57,750
know I'm right here
this is my signal and

1163
00:54:57,750 --> 00:55:02,630
please phagocytose this
again is a visual of

1164
00:55:02,630 --> 00:55:04,950
everything I just said
a little bit of detail

1165
00:55:04,950 --> 00:55:07,550
more maybe but if you
are more visual learner

1166
00:55:07,550 --> 00:55:10,950
i think this is very
nice this is also a

1167
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:14,330
visual of necrosis next
to apoptosis and what's

1168
00:55:14,330 --> 00:55:16,830
going on and the
differences i would look

1169
00:55:16,830 --> 00:55:18,990
at this slide again
you don't have to know

1170
00:55:18,990 --> 00:55:21,770
every single detail but
it's a good overview

1171
00:55:21,990 --> 00:55:25,250
and this i like because
it's a cartoon form

1172
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:27,870
but it shows the
differences between necrosis

1173
00:55:27,870 --> 00:55:31,490
and apoptosis in the way
it looks microscopically

1174
00:55:31,490 --> 00:55:35,150
so there's cell
shrinkage in apoptosis

1175
00:55:35,150 --> 00:55:37,650
that does not happen
in necrosis that's cell

1176
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:40,670
swelling there's
chromatin condensation

1177
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:44,010
which is very characteristic
of apoptosis where

1178
00:55:44,010 --> 00:55:46,450
the chromatin aggregates
peripherally under

1179
00:55:46,450 --> 00:55:48,310
the nuclear membrane
and get these dense

1180
00:55:48,310 --> 00:55:52,130
masses and the formation
of cytoplasmic blebs

1181
00:55:52,130 --> 00:55:55,330
and apoptotic bodies
that's under apoptosis

1182
00:55:55,330 --> 00:55:57,570
and then all the way
on the bottom is the

1183
00:55:57,570 --> 00:56:00,450
phagocytosis by
macrophages but there's no

1184
00:56:00,450 --> 00:56:02,970
inflammatory response
meaning there's
no neutrophils

1185
00:56:02,970 --> 00:56:06,050
coming in and that
limits the damage to

1186
00:56:06,050 --> 00:56:08,870
other tissue around
okay so follow this look

1187
00:56:08,870 --> 00:56:11,390
down the side these
are the differences and

1188
00:56:11,390 --> 00:56:14,370
the similarities I
get this out this is

1189
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:16,330
another slide which I'm
putting up for just for

1190
00:56:16,330 --> 00:56:19,270
your benefit just for
to put away back in

1191
00:56:19,270 --> 00:56:22,030
your mind these are
new mechanisms of cell

1192
00:56:22,030 --> 00:56:23,950
death that have been
described in the past five

1193
00:56:23,950 --> 00:56:26,870
years they're still
being worked out and

1194
00:56:26,870 --> 00:56:28,710
they include things
called necroptasis,

1195
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:32,430
pyroptasis, and phyroptasis.
You can read this.

1196
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:34,770
I'm not going to hold
you accountable to this

1197
00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:37,150
myself. I don't know
if anybody else would.

1198
00:56:37,530 --> 00:56:39,490
Okay, finally, we
got to cellular

1199
00:56:39,490 --> 00:56:42,810
accumulations. Why do
cells accumulate things?

1200
00:56:42,810 --> 00:56:46,490
Why? And how is that
pathology? Well, if

1201
00:56:46,490 --> 00:56:48,990
you have inadequate
removal of substances

1202
00:56:48,990 --> 00:56:51,770
or accumulation of
endogenous substances

1203
00:56:51,770 --> 00:56:55,470
or failure to degrade
substances etc or

1204
00:56:55,470 --> 00:56:59,470
deposition of abnormal
substances exogenously

1205
00:56:59,470 --> 00:57:00,960
these will all
cause cellular

1206
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:03,270
accumulations and there's
a lot of them I want

1207
00:57:03,270 --> 00:57:05,570
to mention lipid protein
pigments and live

1208
00:57:05,570 --> 00:57:08,070
diffusion and I've
got pictures of them

1209
00:57:08,590 --> 00:57:11,730
lipid an example
would be steatosis

1210
00:57:11,730 --> 00:57:14,110
of the liver or
fatty liver this

1211
00:57:14,110 --> 00:57:16,470
is a reversible
cell injury but

1212
00:57:16,470 --> 00:57:21,490
it is seen when
fats accumulate.

1213
00:57:21,710 --> 00:57:23,410
Protein accumulation, an

1214
00:57:23,410 --> 00:57:25,170
example would be amyloid.

1215
00:57:25,610 --> 00:57:27,510
Pigments, there's
all different kinds.

1216
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:30,970
There's coal, there's
melanin, I should say

1217
00:57:30,970 --> 00:57:33,710
carbon, anthracosis,
melanin, hemocytorin,

1218
00:57:33,710 --> 00:57:36,250
lipofusion. What
is lipofusion? It's

1219
00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:38,150
known as a wear and
tear pigment. If you

1220
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:40,150
look at a lot of,
I've done autopsies on

1221
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:42,870
elderly people, a
lot of their um their

1222
00:57:42,870 --> 00:57:45,170
cells in the heart
or the kidney or the

1223
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:47,670
liver will have this
golden brown pigment

1224
00:57:47,810 --> 00:57:51,250
and that is a wear and
tear pigment it shows

1225
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:54,190
you that it's been
around a while and um

1226
00:57:54,190 --> 00:57:58,610
it's you know this is
part of normal uh process

1227
00:57:58,610 --> 00:58:01,270
of aging although it is
a cellular accumulation

1228
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:03,570
that you have to look
at as a pathologist

1229
00:58:03,570 --> 00:58:05,950
because it could be
mistaken for others

1230
00:58:05,950 --> 00:58:08,650
and you'll see what i
mean and the top is the

1231
00:58:08,650 --> 00:58:11,150
liver with big holes
in it those holes are

1232
00:58:11,150 --> 00:58:14,690
fat that's fatty liver
on the right is amyloid

1233
00:58:14,690 --> 00:58:17,570
which is like a pink
glassy looking um

1234
00:58:18,030 --> 00:58:20,690
kind of look to it
you have to do special

1235
00:58:20,690 --> 00:58:23,630
stains to really diagnose
that don't worry um

1236
00:58:23,630 --> 00:58:25,830
on the bottom is the
lipofusion if you see in

1237
00:58:25,830 --> 00:58:28,210
the cardiac it's very
very very light golden

1238
00:58:28,210 --> 00:58:30,450
brown whereas in the
liver it looks very

1239
00:58:30,450 --> 00:58:32,150
dark and that's a
problem because the liver

1240
00:58:32,150 --> 00:58:34,670
also has bile it could
have hemorrhage and all

1241
00:58:34,670 --> 00:58:36,390
those things could
look like that so you

1242
00:58:36,390 --> 00:58:40,490
got to be aware of that
anthracosis is carbon

1243
00:58:40,490 --> 00:58:42,950
this happens to be a
very close-up picture

1244
00:58:42,950 --> 00:58:45,430
of a lung which shows
black lines you probably

1245
00:58:45,430 --> 00:58:48,570
saw this in your um
in your cadavers the

1246
00:58:48,570 --> 00:58:51,090
important part of this
is that anybody who

1247
00:58:51,090 --> 00:58:54,690
smokes or anybody living
in a city would probably

1248
00:58:54,690 --> 00:58:57,590
have some of this
smokers even worse on

1249
00:58:57,590 --> 00:59:00,210
the bottom we have melanin
and then hemocytron

1250
00:59:00,210 --> 00:59:03,590
is broken down blood
so this happens to

1251
00:59:03,590 --> 00:59:07,350
be in lung alveoli
because this is somebody

1252
00:59:07,350 --> 00:59:10,510
with congestive heart
failure blood backed up

1253
00:59:10,510 --> 00:59:13,410
into the lung and
macrophages so there's all

1254
00:59:13,410 --> 00:59:15,510
it's evidence of old
hemorrhage or old blood

1255
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:19,290
okay a really quick
thing about hyaline

1256
00:59:19,290 --> 00:59:21,750
change you'll it's not
hyaline cartilage again

1257
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:25,530
it's a pink glassy
look and it's more of a

1258
00:59:25,530 --> 00:59:29,990
of a descriptive
thing there is finally

1259
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:32,870
pathological calcification
meaning there are you

1260
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:34,490
can see calcification
in certain tissues

1261
00:59:34,490 --> 00:59:37,830
and that's not normal um
it could be dystrophic

1262
00:59:37,830 --> 00:59:40,710
or metastatic dystrophic
means the person

1263
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:44,610
has a normal serum
calcium but it's the area

1264
00:59:44,610 --> 00:59:46,870
that's being calcified
is damaged so what

1265
00:59:46,870 --> 00:59:52,160
an example of that would
be uh cardiac valves

1266
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:55,190
which get calcified
sometimes is because of

1267
00:59:55,190 --> 00:59:59,150
damage and so it's
calcium deposition on

1268
00:59:59,150 --> 01:00:02,050
abnormal tissue whereas
metastatic calcification

1269
01:00:02,050 --> 01:00:05,190
which has no specific
relationship to

1270
01:00:05,190 --> 01:00:07,970
malignancy i don't like
the term the tissue is

1271
01:00:07,970 --> 01:00:11,660
normal but the person
has hypercalcemia four

1272
01:00:12,050 --> 01:00:14,650
major causes include
those mentioned there

1273
01:00:15,350 --> 01:00:17,270
hyperparathyroidism
vitamin d disorders

1274
01:00:17,270 --> 01:00:19,890
etc and you can see
this especially in the

1275
01:00:19,890 --> 01:00:23,070
kidney and lung gastric
mucosa so here's

1276
01:00:23,070 --> 01:00:26,350
a picture of distrosive
calcification up

1277
01:00:26,350 --> 01:00:29,710
on top left it's very
blue purple that's

1278
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:32,020
the color of
calcification also it's

1279
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:34,060
crunchy if there's
a lot of it and the

1280
01:00:34,060 --> 01:00:36,390
metastatic one in the
lung has not to do with

1281
01:00:36,390 --> 01:00:38,230
cancer but the person
had hypercalcemia

1282
01:00:38,690 --> 01:00:41,710
so this is the
summary slide and

1283
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:43,630
I know I went a
little bit over

1284
01:00:43,630 --> 01:00:45,110
I thank you for
your attention

1285
01:00:45,810 --> 01:00:47,410
and if you have
any questions,

1286
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:48,950
please reach out
to me. Thank you.
