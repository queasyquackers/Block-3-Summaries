00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:04,300
This is the OMM lab
number 11 for week

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:08,180
13, Lumbar Diagnosis
and Lumbar Soft

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:11,680
Tissue Techniques.
I'm Dr. Jamie Mancini.

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,880
The objectives
for this lab are

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,100
going to be to
identify the

6
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,460
vertebral segments
T12 through S1,

7
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:25,890
evaluate the
connective tissue and

8
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,000
neuromusculoskeletal
system for

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,460
TART changes and
diagnosing type 1

10
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,720
and type 2 somatic
dysfunctions.

11
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,900
Also documenting those

12
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,200
somatic dysfunctions.

13
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,920
Be able to identify
evaluate and

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,640
understand the
physiology of the muscles

15
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,260
and tendons of the
back abdomen and

16
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:46,080
buttocks and hip
flexors and extensors.

17
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,900
Understand the importance
of the osteopathic

18
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,640
examination of
dysfunctions muscle tone

19
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,940
and function in the
clinical assessment of

20
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:58,740
back pain also assess
for contraindications

21
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,180
of soft tissue techniques
and demonstrate

22
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:03,300
the soft tissue
techniques of this lab

23
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:07,140
for the beginning of
your physical examination

24
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,480
you'll be looking
at the lumbar spine

25
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,660
region so visually
you'll start looking at

26
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:15,480
the posture see that
there is a lordotic

27
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,860
curve that's a backward
bending curve in the

28
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:24,080
lumbar spine um below
the thoracic spine

29
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:28,320
The T10 to T12 of
the thoracic spine

30
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,360
is also lordotic,
so you'll have to

31
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,120
be able to distinguish
between those.

32
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,680
While you're examining
visually, you might

33
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,440
want to have to sit
down in order to get

34
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,660
a better look at the
lower part of the

35
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:45,020
body to look for
symmetry. And you're going

36
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:48,270
to be looking at this
on the horizontal,

37
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,100
sagittal, and coronal
planes. and visually

38
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:55,360
you're going to
inspect left to right

39
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,820
of the plumb line
that's the midline and

40
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:05,660
comparing that to the
and to the horizontal

41
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:09,080
and coronal and
sagittal lines of the

42
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,860
room around you the sort
of a helpful reference

43
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:15,220
point so that you
can determine if the

44
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,700
different parts of
the body are level

45
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,580
from left to right and
from front to back.

46
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,860
Examples of
this are going

47
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,820
to include the
iliac crest.

48
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,940
That's a large
major indicator

49
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,160
of asymmetry if
the iliac crests

50
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,920
are already
looking on level.

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,600
Another part of the
examination is to

52
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,800
visually inspect
the range of motion

53
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,340
of the lumbar spine
and this is going

54
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,200
to be first with
active range of

55
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,160
motion testing.
Active is when the

56
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,500
patient is actively
using their muscles.

57
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:57,420
So this is a range
that the lumbar

58
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,420
spine or thoracolumbar
spine can

59
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,600
typically move in
in a healthy person.

60
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,080
When you are looking
at them side bending as

61
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,540
you're looking from
behind you're going to

62
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:12,540
want to take a look
at the actual line of

63
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:16,140
their spine to see if
the curve of side bending

64
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,900
to the right and to
the left is a smooth

65
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,720
curve or if there's sort
of like kinks in the

66
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,100
curve that may indicate
that there's somatic

67
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,260
dysfunction or a
restriction in movement.

68
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:28,000
You'll also be looking
at the muscle tone

69
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,120
as they move from side
bending and to side

70
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,920
and forward bending to
back and if those muscles

71
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:42,950
are symmetrical in
tone and activation.

72
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,060
In this table of
characteristics of vertebral

73
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:53,080
segmental dysfunction
and adaptations,

74
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,270
you'll see that for
non-neutral segmental

75
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,440
dysfunctions,
again these are the

76
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,540
Freyat's type 2 segmental
dysfunctions. The

77
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:05,900
documentation is based
on the biomechanical

78
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,080
position or preference
of the joint.

79
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:14,740
So the documentation
will have three

80
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:17,620
letters and then whether
it's left or right.

81
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,480
The first letter is
going to be whether

82
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,960
it's flexed or
extended. The second and

83
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,300
third letter are the
rotation and side

84
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,020
bending because in
type 2 dysfunctions

85
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:29,380
or non-neutral
segmental dysfunctions.

86
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:32,720
These are in the same
direction and then

87
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,300
you'll have the
sidedness left or right.

88
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,920
The opposite
of the somatic

89
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,760
dysfunction
preference or position

90
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:46,160
is the restricted
motion and the

91
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,300
restricted motion
is going to be

92
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:53,360
the opposite in
flexion extension

93
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,500
and the opposite
in left or right.

94
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,150
Sometimes the type 2

95
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:07,050
dysfunctions are in the

96
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:09,990
middle or apex
of a type 1 group

97
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:13,190
curve or at the ends
of the group curves

98
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:16,090
and in these cases
you would want

99
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:18,600
to treat the type 2
dysfunction before

100
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,570
treating the type
1 dysfunction.

101
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:26,550
What you're going
to be doing for the

102
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,330
lumbar spinal
somatic dysfunction

103
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:32,290
diagnosis is using the
anatomical landmarks

104
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,630
to identify the
lumbar spine region.

105
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:38,190
You'll be using
a screening

106
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,830
approach to identify
the segments

107
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:42,150
you want to focus
on diagnosing.

108
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:45,870
You'll use your
landmarks, bony

109
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:48,090
landmarks, to
figure out at which

110
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:51,130
level you are,
L1 through L5.

111
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:55,330
And then you'll palpate
for the posterior

112
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:58,590
transverse
processes laterally

113
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:02,690
from the spinous
process in that area.

114
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:07,750
Using bony
landmarks to find

115
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,430
the lumbar spine
you're going to

116
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:13,330
start with either
the 12th rib

117
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:17,430
or the iliac
crest and PSIS.

118
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,670
If you start with
the 12th rib you go

119
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:23,560
to the bottom of
the rib cage find

120
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:28,290
the 12th rib and
T12 spinous process.

121
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:31,070
The spinous process
just below that is

122
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:35,910
L1 and then it
continues down to L5.

123
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:40,210
The iliac crest height
are between L4 and

124
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:46,090
L5 and the PSIS's are
at the level of S2.

125
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:52,290
If you feel the top
of the sacrum it feels

126
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:55,910
like a flatter surface
and that's we're

127
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:58,550
going to be feeling
the sacral sulci. Just

128
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:01,580
above that there's a
little bit of space

129
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:06,470
before you get to the
L5 bony processes.

130
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:10,950
Once you've identified
the lumbar spine

131
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:15,790
area you're going to
see if any of these

132
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:20,410
spinous processes are
tender and you can start

133
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:25,830
evaluating for
paraspinal tart changes.

134
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:28,830
So as you move your
hands to the side you're

135
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,810
going to be looking
for signs of tart

136
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:34,230
changes, tissue texture
change, asymmetry, so

137
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:37,510
you'll find the transverse
processes and feel

138
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:41,710
if they're asymmetrical
as far as the depth

139
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:44,430
that they feel and
also for restricted

140
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:47,350
motion, which we'll go
over in a few slides.

141
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:50,910
And you're going
to be asking your

142
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:52,990
patient if any of
those areas are tender.

143
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:58,450
If there's any
tenderness to the actual

144
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:02,010
spinous process in
the middle, then you'd

145
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:03,530
want to see if there
was a history of

146
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:06,070
trauma or any signs
of trauma in the area.

147
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:10,850
If the paraspinal
musculature around

148
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:12,990
the transverse
processes is tender,

149
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:15,330
that's going to be
a sign that there's

150
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:17,310
likely a somatic
dysfunction there.

151
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:21,450
In the soft tissue
surrounding the

152
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:24,170
spine, this is primarily
your paraspinal

153
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,110
muscles and the
fascia, you're going

154
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:29,310
to be checking for
those tart changes,

155
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,230
tissue texture changes
you're going to

156
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:36,050
be looking for areas of
hyper or hypotonicity

157
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:40,530
so hypertonicity
being a muscle

158
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:43,170
that's contracted and
hypotonicity is going

159
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:45,630
to be one that is
more pliable supple

160
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:50,030
or not contracting
would be hypo very

161
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:54,110
hypotonicity again
areas of tenderness you

162
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:56,430
can look for color
changes because the

163
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,770
sympathetic chain
ganglia extend inferiorly

164
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:03,090
to L2. So you can
slide your fingers down

165
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:07,190
the spine and determine
if there is any

166
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:10,390
chronic or acute changes
from the sympathetic

167
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:13,810
chain ganglia
reflexes in that area.

168
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:16,210
And also continue to

169
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:19,060
check your
bony landmarks.

170
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:21,650
Checking your bony
landmarks includes feeling

171
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:24,330
the whole shape of
the bone so that you

172
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,770
can tell if you're on
the same part of the

173
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:30,770
bone from left to
right in finding the

174
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:33,390
lumbar spine transverse
processes you're going

175
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:36,110
to palpate about 1.5
inches lateral from

176
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:38,450
midline so from your
spinous processes

177
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:41,360
it's going to be about
one and a half to two

178
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:47,230
of the lengths of the
last bone or part of

179
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:51,710
your thumb the The
rotational segmental

180
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:55,110
motion examination is
going to involve putting

181
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:59,170
your thumbs symmetrically
on the transverse

182
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:01,570
processes of the
same lumbar segment.

183
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:04,170
Please confirm
that it's the

184
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,010
same lumbar
segment that your

185
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:08,750
thumbs are on from
left to right.

186
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,290
For a class, your
patient's going to be

187
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:14,090
prone. If you're in
the office and your

188
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:16,110
patient is uncomfortable
sitting, I mean

189
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:19,030
laying prone, or you
don't have a table for

190
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:21,230
that, you can do it in
the seated position.

191
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,470
But for class, we're
going to start out

192
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:26,130
with the patient
prone, and you're going

193
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:27,850
to be having your
thumbs on the transverse

194
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:30,490
processes of the
segment to be tested.

195
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:35,370
You're going to apply a
firm pressure anteriorly

196
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:38,050
in the patient's
body toward the table

197
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:41,530
on one side at a
time and be feeling

198
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:43,870
on the other
side if the other

199
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:46,830
transverse process
moves back or not.

200
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:49,830
If there's resistance
to that motion,

201
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:52,270
that means there's a
posterior transverse

202
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:55,210
process on the side
that resists going

203
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:57,690
anteriorly or
rotating to the left.

204
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:00,630
That means the
dysfunction is rotated to

205
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:04,570
the right if the right
transverse process

206
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:09,590
resists going anterior
with your pressure or

207
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:13,190
rotating to the left,
that vertebra. Once

208
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:20,930
you find your transverse
processes of the

209
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:26,450
lumbar spine, you can
check for side bending

210
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:29,850
and rotation. So to
check for side bending,

211
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,930
you have both
of your thumbs

212
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:37,290
on the transverse
processes.

213
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:42,310
You'll induce some
right side bending by

214
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:47,110
pushing the transverse
process to the left,

215
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:49,790
and you would check
for left side bending

216
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:53,330
dysfunction by pressing
the transverse process

217
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:58,710
towards the right,
the left transverse

218
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:01,750
process towards the
right that is. If there's

219
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,930
a restriction then
there's a restriction in

220
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:07,930
side bending and you
would name it for the

221
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:11,850
direction that it side
spends two without

222
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:18,490
restriction or with less
restriction. To check

223
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:20,830
for rotation you'll
again have your thumbs

224
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:23,510
on the transverse
processes. You'll push

225
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:27,250
the one transverse
process anteriorly while

226
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:30,170
monitoring the other
transverse process gently

227
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:33,420
with your other thumb.
If it goes anteriorly

228
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:37,390
on the right and the
left post, the left

229
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,450
transverse process
feels like it comes

230
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:43,610
posterior, then you're
rotating it to the left.

231
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:46,890
If you go to try to
rotate it to the right

232
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:50,650
by pressing anteriorly
with on the left

233
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:53,850
transverse process, but
the right doesn't come

234
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:58,470
back towards you into
your thumb, then it's

235
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:00,630
a left rotation
dysfunction because it

236
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:03,490
will rotate to the left
but not to the right.

237
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:08,170
Remember that the
motion of the vertebral

238
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:12,330
unit is guided by the
contours of shapes

239
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:17,130
of the guiding
surfaces of the facets.

240
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:21,410
So flexion and extension
is on the sagittal

241
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:24,050
plane, rotation is on
the horizontal plane,

242
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:26,210
and side bending is
on the coronal plane.

243
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:29,390
Because of the motion
guiding structures,

244
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:32,810
in type 2 dysfunctions,
rotation and

245
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:34,570
side bending are in
the same direction.

246
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:41,610
While the bony
structures, mostly

247
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:43,810
the facets,
guide the motion

248
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:45,770
in only specific
directions,

249
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:48,970
the connective tissue,
including ligaments

250
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:51,270
and tendons, limit
the range of motion.

251
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:54,170
When there's a severe
somatic dysfunction,

252
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,030
sometimes the connective
tissue may have

253
00:13:57,030 --> 00:14:01,050
some tears, which may
make it hypermobile.

254
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:02,950
This is something
you should also

255
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:05,730
pay attention to
during your care.

256
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:09,170
Also, if there's
complaints of numbness,

257
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:11,390
tingling, pins
and needles, or

258
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:15,270
weakness, you'd want
to check for the

259
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,870
integrity of the
neural structures.

260
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,890
There are more
than one approaches

261
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:25,490
to diagnosing
extension versus

262
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:28,430
deflection in the
somatic dysfunctions.

263
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:32,570
With your thumbs
on both transverse

264
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:35,850
processes of the
same lumbar vertebra,

265
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:39,470
you can roll your
thumbs up over

266
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:43,950
the top of the
transverse processes.

267
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:50,050
And if the posterior
transverse process

268
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:53,070
becomes more symmetrical
with the other

269
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:56,570
side, then it's a
flexion dysfunction.

270
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:59,850
If you go the opposite
direction with

271
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:02,290
your thumbs and
that makes the

272
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:04,970
transverse processes
more symmetrical,

273
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,410
then that would be an

274
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:07,470
extension dysfunction.

275
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:14,770
Also, you can do
that in the full body

276
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:17,070
poses that we'll show
in the next slides.

277
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:23,310
If you're having trouble
finding the extension

278
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:27,670
or flexion component
of your synaptic

279
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,990
dysfunction with just
rolling your thumbs

280
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:32,850
up or down over the
transverse processes,

281
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:35,130
you can also palpate
for symmetrical

282
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:39,390
ease of rotation in
extension in the prone

283
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:41,650
position. You just
ask your patient

284
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,410
if they could prop
themselves up on their

285
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,230
elbows and rest
their face on their

286
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:48,630
hands like they're
watching TV and this

287
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,830
puts the lumbar
spine into extension.

288
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:54,310
If the transverse
processes have a

289
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:57,630
symmetrical ease
of rotation, also

290
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:02,470
considered to have no
posterior transverse

291
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,910
process, then that
would mean that

292
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,430
it's an extension
dysfunction because

293
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:08,530
it's more symmetrical
in extension.

294
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:13,670
The TV watching
pose is also similar

295
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,950
to the sphinx
pose and yoga

296
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:20,160
which is also
useful for checking

297
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,130
for lumbar extension
dysfunctions.

298
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:28,970
The flexion dysfunctions
can be assessed

299
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:32,970
in child's pose. You
ask your patient to

300
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:36,110
go onto their knees
and bring their hips

301
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:38,570
back into child's
pose and from there

302
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:41,690
you'll palpate the
transverse processes,

303
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:46,010
assess rotational
component from one

304
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:48,650
side to the other to
determine if they're

305
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:52,210
more symmetrical
in rotation and

306
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:54,790
flexion to make it a
flexion dysfunction.

307
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:58,930
As you document
the somatic

308
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:01,390
dysfunctions you
find on your patient,

309
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:06,130
you'll write them
down again as flexion

310
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:12,230
or extension, rotated
and side bent to the

311
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:14,190
same side. So the
side that has the

312
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:18,290
transverse process
that's posterior is going

313
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:21,390
to be the side that
it's rotated towards.

314
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:25,010
So if you find a
posterior transverse

315
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:32,570
process on the right
side of L4, and

316
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:35,110
when you roll your
fingers up over

317
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:37,670
the transverse
processes, that posterior

318
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:40,570
transverse process
disappears because

319
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:42,710
it's more symmetrical
in flexion.

320
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:47,790
I'm sorry, L3. Then
this would be a

321
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:50,110
L3 flexed, rotated,
and side bent to

322
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:54,410
the right. And that
is the description

323
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:57,170
biomechanically of
its motion on L4.

324
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,790
This is a list of
the abbreviations

325
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,280
for documenting somatic

326
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,320
dysfunctions on
the physical exam.

327
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:14,040
This chart summarizes
the biomechanical

328
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,880
motions of somatic
dysfunctions

329
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,700
that you'd find
on physical exam.

330
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:23,520
After locating and
documenting type 1

331
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,700
sematic dysfunctions,
you'll move on to

332
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,160
type 1 dysfunctions.
So these are going

333
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,280
to follow Freyette's
first principle.

334
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,540
And in the type
1 dysfunctions,

335
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,200
again, these are
group curves.

336
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:39,220
It's considered neutral,
so there's no change

337
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:44,320
in flexion or extension
and the rotation

338
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,740
and side bending are
in opposite directions.

339
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:50,480
Sometimes this is
formed as a compensation

340
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,200
to other health issues
or misalignments.

341
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:02,700
On the physical exam
in the presence of

342
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,680
a type 1 somatic
dysfunctions all of the

343
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,920
transverse processes
of that group

344
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,780
dysfunction will be
posterior on the same

345
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:16,200
side so if the vertebral
segments have a

346
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,960
transverse process
as posterior from L1

347
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:24,480
to L4 then you're
gonna have a neutral

348
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:30,120
side bent right rotated
left dysfunction.

349
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,900
As you motion test
inflection and

350
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,520
extension there
should be no change

351
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,740
in the posterior
transverse processes

352
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,640
that's what
makes it neutral.

353
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:45,720
Your diagnosis would
be notated as L1 to

354
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:51,620
L4 neutral side bent
right rotated left and

355
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:55,900
the abbreviation is
below there and SRRL.

356
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:03,750
The neutral or type
1 dysfunctions have

357
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,860
groups of three or more
segments, and these

358
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:09,280
segments may include
the thoracic spine.

359
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,560
This picture

360
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,860
represents a neutral side

361
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:18,940
bent right, rotated left.

362
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,600
Keep in mind that
the motion of a

363
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,760
vertebra in any one
plane of motion will

364
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,320
influence the
motion of that same

365
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,020
vertebra in any other
plane of motion.

366
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,680
This is a pictorial
representation

367
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,380
of a type 2 dysfunction,

368
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,640
so single segment.

369
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,660
In the lumbar sacral
spring test, the

370
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,080
patient lies prone on
the examination table.

371
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:50,240
The physician stands
to the side with the

372
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,820
dominant eye over the
midline. You place

373
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:55,160
one hand over the
midline of the lumbar

374
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,700
region with the thenar
eminence over the

375
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,940
lumbar sacral junction.
The lumbosacral

376
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:04,120
junction is L5 and the
base of the sacrum.

377
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:06,960
The fingers extend
superiorly over the

378
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,680
spinous processes and
paravertebral tissue.

379
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:15,120
You provide a short
quick push into the

380
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,280
anterior direction
of the body and

381
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,100
that's a few millimeters
or so of a push.

382
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,640
This will evaluate
for springiness

383
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,860
or compliance of
the lumbar spine

384
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,680
or you'll feel
resistance or

385
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,540
stiffness to the
springing motion.

386
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:37,220
The resistance is
considered a positive

387
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,860
test. If there's
compliance or springiness

388
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:42,340
to the spine then
it's a negative test.

389
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,180
Sometimes you'll
have a patient who

390
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:51,900
can't tolerate laying
prone, and you can

391
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:55,220
also perform the
physical exam of the

392
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:59,040
lumbar spine in a
seated position as

393
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,580
well as a lateral
recumbent position.

394
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,960
In this chart prepared
by Dr. Koyman,

395
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:11,120
you can see that
the rotation of a

396
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,100
somatic dysfunction
is on a vertical axis

397
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:16,690
in a horizontal
plane, side bending is

398
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:20,980
all around an AP axis
on a coronal plane,

399
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:23,760
and flexion extension
happen around

400
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,580
a transverse axis
on a sagittal plane.

401
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:31,100
This can be checked
in prone or lateral,

402
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:35,760
recumbent and or
the sphinx position.

403
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,720
In the rotation aspect
your thumbs are on

404
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,160
the transverse processes.
For side bending

405
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,840
you can have the thumbs
on the inferior facets

406
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:50,500
of the articular
columns and in flexion

407
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:54,700
extension you can also
put your finger pads

408
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,400
on the spinous processes
or between them.

409
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:02,560
And here you're
checking for the

410
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,320
ease of preference
and symmetry.

411
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,060
In this chart prepared
by Dr. Koyman,

412
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:13,530
you're looking at
active testing, looking

413
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,700
at neutral range
flexion and extension.

414
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,640
In the lumbar spine,
in neutral mechanics

415
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,320
or type 1 mechanics,
side bending and

416
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,660
rotation occur in
opposite sides and this

417
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,760
motion is guided by
the vertebral bodies.

418
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:34,520
In the non-neutral
or type 2, the side

419
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,000
bending rotation
on the same side

420
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,140
and it's governed
more by the facets.

421
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:42,140
A common mistake when
people are learning

422
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:45,160
documentation of
somaticus functions is to

423
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,400
document the direction
that is restricted in

424
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,420
motion. However, semi
dysfunctions are named

425
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:54,040
for the freedom of
motion or ease of motion.

426
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,870
You'll be practicing
the soft tissue

427
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,840
techniques and the
goals of these are to

428
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:04,180
relax muscles and fascia,
improve circulation

429
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:08,140
to the muscles that
can include arterial

430
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:12,660
blood and well as
well as venous and

431
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:16,700
lymphatic drainage,
improving mobility,

432
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,340
decreasing pain,
interfering with

433
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:25,900
regression of acute
pain to chronic pain,

434
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:32,960
to relax the stretch
reflexes, and an

435
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,360
overall improved
patient quality of life.

436
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:40,780
Although there
aren't any absolute

437
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:44,220
contraindications to soft
tissue techniques that

438
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:47,120
are especially noted,
there are cautions

439
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,440
and relative
contraindications for local

440
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,180
application of soft
tissue techniques. That

441
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:54,860
includes fractures,
open wounds, soft

442
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:58,020
tissue or bony infections
at the local site,

443
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:01,440
abscesses, DVTs,
coagulopathies,

444
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,340
neoplasms, or
directly over

445
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,730
the site of a
recent operation.

446
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:08,500
Here are the
links to the soft

447
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,740
tissue techniques
of this lab.

448
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,240
You're going to
be performing a

449
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:16,600
prone traction
using two hands.

450
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:20,620
This is going to involve
the patient laying

451
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:24,660
prone. First identify
the lumbar paraspinal

452
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:28,580
muscles and palpate
for any hypertonicity

453
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:33,260
in the myofascial
structures and then

454
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,380
perform the technique.

455
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:42,330
In the prone pressure
with counter leverage

456
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:44,890
technique, the patient's
laying prone with

457
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:47,850
their head torn head
turned towards you.

458
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:50,370
You'll be standing
on the opposite

459
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:52,090
side of the side
to be treated.

460
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:57,750
You place your thumb
and thenar eminence of

461
00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:00,130
the cephalet hand on
the medial aspect of

462
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:03,070
the paravetebral muscles
and fascia that's

463
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:05,570
overlying the lumbar
transverse processes.

464
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:07,930
That's going to be on the

465
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:09,040
side that you
want treated.

466
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:15,510
Then you'll use
your caudate hand to

467
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:20,230
contact the ASIS
on the side to be

468
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:22,030
treated. Then you'll
gently lift that

469
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:25,090
ASIS towards the
ceiling, so upwards.

470
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:29,490
Use a gentle force
ventrally and

471
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:31,060
laterally with
the cephalate hand

472
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:33,030
perpendicular to the
grain of the fibers

473
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,810
of the perivertebral
musculature.

474
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:37,750
Hold that for several
seconds then slowly

475
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:40,470
release. Then you
repeat this these

476
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:43,090
last steps four through
six several times

477
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:45,510
in slow, rhythmic,
and kneading fashion.

478
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:49,990
Then you can reposition
your cephalodic

479
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:51,210
hand to contact different

480
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:53,850
levels of lumbar
spine that you find a

481
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:57,000
dysfunction or
tissue tension in.

482
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:03,970
This is the prone
pressure with counter

483
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:07,930
leverage technique
and with the hand

484
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:10,610
that's more cephalad
you're going to be

485
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:15,390
stabilizing the
torso and then with

486
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:18,370
your more caudid hand
you're going to be

487
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:21,790
bringing the
body towards you.

488
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:28,430
In the supine extension
technique, the

489
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:31,290
patient lines supine
while the physician

490
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:33,230
sits on the same
side to be treated.

491
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:36,730
Your palms will be up
under the patient's

492
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:39,350
lumbar spine, placed
with the finger pads

493
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:43,150
on the perivertebral
musculature between

494
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:45,650
the spinous and the
transverse processes.

495
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:50,750
apply a gentle
ventral lateral force

496
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:54,090
perpendicular to the
perivertebral muscular

497
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:57,710
grain fiber you're going
to create a fulcrum

498
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,830
by applying a downward
pressure through

499
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:03,230
the elbows on the table
so this way you're

500
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:05,250
making a teeter
-totter out of your

501
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:09,610
forearms let's say
your elbows go down and

502
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:12,550
your hands or fingers
go upward in order

503
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:15,910
to make the technique
less of a strain on

504
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:17,490
the physician.

505
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:21,850
This way you can
produce a lateral

506
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:23,450
stretch
perpendicular to the

507
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:26,330
thoracic perivertebral
or lumbar

508
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:28,550
perivertebral
musculature.

509
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,910
You'll hold it for
several seconds and then

510
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:35,490
release to repeat
steps four through six

511
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,270
several times in a
gentle rhythmic and

512
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:43,470
kneading fashion and
then repeat the technique

513
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:46,200
at a different level
if there's more tissue

514
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:49,590
tension or dysfunction
in other levels.

515
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:53,290
This is the supine
extension soft tissue

516
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:55,790
technique in which
the patient is supine

517
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:57,710
and you'll be using
both of your hands

518
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:01,270
in the paraspinal
musculature to induce

519
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:04,130
a lateral stretch
it's perpendicular

520
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:07,650
to the spine until
you have a release.

521
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:20,030
Points to remember
are how to find the

522
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:23,210
anatomical landmarks
for the lumbar spine,

523
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:26,810
the tart changes,
and how to

524
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:28,270
diagnose type
