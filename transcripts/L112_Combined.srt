00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,560
Or Smell and Taste
The following three

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,240
videos provide
a summary of the

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,280
special senses for
the head and neck.

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,880
Much of this information
is distilled from

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,200
chapters 8 and 10 of
Moore's Clinically

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,880
Oriented Anatomy. As
with previous lecture

9
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,160
videos, I recommend
focusing on the blue

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,080
pages slash blue boxes
in these chapters as

11
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,400
they will contain
the most clinically

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,840
relevant information
about these structures.

13
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,320
This lecture video
series completes our

14
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,940
trek through the 12
cranial nerves. We will

15
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,020
cover cranial nerves
1, 2, and 8, with brief

16
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,540
cameos from cranial
nerves 7, 9, and 10.

17
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,300
Today's video
covers the two most

18
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,680
underrepresented
senses in our body,

19
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,960
starting with cranial
nerve 1, olfactory.

20
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,520
This is the least
researched cranial

21
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,920
nerve, and the one
that is the least

22
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,560
valued in everyday
life. Humans just

23
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,400
don't emphasize
our sense of smell.

24
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,120
The structure
typically referred

25
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,880
to as the
olfactory nerve is

26
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,700
in fact the
olfactory stalk.

27
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,860
This structure is
comprised of the

28
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,420
olfactory tract
and olfactory bulb.

29
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:14,020
The olfactory nerve
is not a true nerve.

30
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,760
These structures
are anterior

31
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,040
extensions of the
forebrain that end in

32
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,180
multiple little
terminal nerves.

33
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,580
This is the human
olfactory bulb. Compared

34
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,260
to other animals
such as rats, dogs,

35
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,560
alligators, or even
dinosaurs such as

36
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,720
Tyrannosaurus rex,
it's pretty clear just

37
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,840
how much humans have
reduced our sense

38
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,700
of smell. The olfactory
bulbs rest above

39
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,720
the cribriform plate
of endocranium.

40
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:40,900
From the olfactory
bulbs, 10 or so nerves

41
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,420
descend down through
the cribriform plate of

42
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,980
the ethmoid bone. The
nerves traverse the

43
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,440
cheese-grater-like
cribriform plate until they

44
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,500
reach their destination
in the mucosa of the

45
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,000
superior-most portion
of the nasal passage.

46
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,680
Although we often
associate the nasal

47
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,160
passage with the
sense of smell,

48
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,620
only the superior
-most portion of the

49
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,060
nasal passage—a
relatively small part of

50
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,760
the entire nasal
passage—is capable of

51
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,420
olfaction. The remainder
of the nasal passage

52
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:10,020
is used to filter,
warm, and humidify

53
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,980
air before it enters
the lungs, and then

54
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,940
to reclaim that
water on the way out.

55
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:16,680
The three internal
swellings we see in

56
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,600
the nasal passage
are called conchi.

57
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,560
They are named
for their shape,

58
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,040
which resembles
a conch or conch.

59
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,340
Think of a conch
shell on the beach.

60
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,940
Only the superior
concha houses

61
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,600
olfactory epithelium.
This epithelium

62
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,580
extends over the
superior concha

63
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,820
and the adjoining
medial nasal wall.

64
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,280
This is where the
olfactory nerves end.

65
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,860
Formation of the
superior concha is

66
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,840
variable, with some
people not having

67
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,120
a superior concha
at all. Instead,

68
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,680
the olfactory nerves
are distributed

69
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,460
over the roof of
the nasal passage.

70
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,120
Air entering the
superior concal

71
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,800
portion of the
airway, referred

72
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,830
to as the
superior meatus,

73
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,400
slowly traverses the
olfactory epithelium.

74
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,420
Odorant molecules
get captured by the

75
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,500
olfactory mucosa,
transporting the

76
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,020
molecules to olfactory
receptor cells.

77
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,100
This triggers the
cells, depolarizing them

78
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,800
and sending the signal
back through the

79
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,760
cribriform plate and
into the olfactory

80
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,120
bulb where they synapse
with another specialized

81
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,840
group of cells,
called mitral cells.

82
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,900
These cells send
the olfactory signal

83
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,880
back to the rest of
the brain along two

84
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,840
different olfactory
striae, a lateral

85
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,440
and a medial stria.
The olfactory nerve

86
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,440
is the only cranial
nerve that directly

87
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,380
connects to the
cerebrum. All other

88
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,540
cranial nerves connect
from the brainstem.

89
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,080
Clinical correlate.
The most common

90
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,140
clinical case related
to the olfactory system

91
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,720
is anosmia, or the
inability to smell.

92
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,240
Anosmia can be
acquired from multiple

93
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,960
sources, including
damage to the

94
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,980
olfactory epithelium
itself or the

95
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,780
cribriform plate. In
many instances, there

96
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,600
is a congenital
component involved.

97
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,300
This pathology has
received more attention

98
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,040
recently, as anosmia
used to be a hallmark

99
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,940
of early variants of
the COVID-19 infection.

100
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,560
Anosmia largely affects
a person's quality

101
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,160
of life. People with
anosmia will comment on

102
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,740
food being less
appetizing. This is due to

103
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,600
the intimate connection
between smell and

104
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,040
taste, which we will
cover later in the video.

105
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,160
People suffering
from anosmia may find

106
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,940
themselves in urgent
care more often

107
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,000
due to accidental
food poisoning as the

108
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,920
lack of smell
receptors prevents them

109
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,340
from recognizing when
food has spoiled.

110
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,180
The second special
afferent in

111
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,920
this video is
taste, or gustation.

112
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:32,480
Taste is unique as it
is the only special

113
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,600
afferent to span
multiple cranial

114
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,940
nerves. The sense of
taste is conveyed to

115
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,740
the brain on cranial
nerves 7, 9, and 10.

116
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,660
Taste is the ability
to recognize chemical

117
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,940
signatures on items
that touch the tongue,

118
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:48,120
which is the main organ
for taste sensation.

119
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,700
The capacity to
taste also exists

120
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,880
on part of the oral
soft palate and

121
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,840
pharynx, but
these all pale in

122
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,160
comparison to what
we see on the tongue.

123
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,760
Gustation on the
tongue is made possible

124
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,840
due to numerous ridges
on the surface and

125
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,240
sides of the tongue
mucosa. These ridges

126
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,240
are called lingual
papillae. There are

127
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,240
four types of lingual
papillae, filiform,

128
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,500
foliate, fungiform,
and circumvalate.

129
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,440
Circumvalate papillae

130
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,700
are the least numerous,

131
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,320
with the typical
person having between

132
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,220
8 and 12 papillae.
In contrast,

133
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,160
filiform papillae
are extremely

134
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,520
numerous and cover
most of the tongue.

135
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,980
However, filiform
papillae are

136
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,600
also the only
lingual papillae

137
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,700
that lack taste
receptor cells.

138
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,540
Instead, these
papillae function in

139
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,740
gripping food items
with the tongue. The

140
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,420
taste-sensing
structures on the other

141
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:42,140
three papillae are
called taste buds.

142
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,740
Taste buds are a
collection of afferent

143
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,780
neurons that come
together to form a single

144
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,520
taste-sensing structure.
Each taste bud

145
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,680
has between 50 to
150 taste receptor

146
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,900
cells bundled together
to form a structure

147
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,160
that looks a bit like
a hand of bananas.

148
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,260
A single lingual papilla
may have hundreds

149
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,760
of taste buds across
its surface. There

150
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,160
are five recognized
taste categories.

151
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,320
Sweet, salty,
sour, bitter,

152
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,280
and umami, or savory.

153
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,280
Hold up a minute.
What about spicy food?

154
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:15,060
That's a taste, isn't it?

155
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:18,440
Though we often
associate spiciness with

156
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,440
food flavors, spice
is not a true taste.

157
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,780
There are no spice
receptors on the tongue.

158
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,820
Instead, spice
is conveyed back

159
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,360
to the brain
via these guys,

160
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,980
our nosoceptors.

161
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,620
Nosoceptors are our
pain receptor cells.

162
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,280
Spices, typically
from capsaicin,

163
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,820
irritate our mucosal
lining, and that pain

164
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,160
is relayed back to
the brain via our

165
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,880
nosoceptors. In
particular, our thermal

166
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:48,080
nosoceptors, hence why
spicy food feels hot.

167
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,640
The unique way
that individuals

168
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,840
interpret this pain
is what determines

169
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,820
a person's
spice tolerance.

170
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,000
This is also why you
can taste with your

171
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,220
eyes, nose, genitalia,
and **** region.

172
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,120
Theoretically, any
part of our body

173
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,620
that has nosocceptors
can taste spicy

174
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,680
food, though this
is often limited

175
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,280
to just parts that
contain mucosa.

176
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,540
So, not a true
taste category, but

177
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:16,360
still a fascinating
phenomenon. Alright,

178
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,780
back to taste buds.

179
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:23,580
Taste receptor cells
are sensitive to only

180
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,160
one of the five taste
types mentioned here.

181
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,400
However, the
distribution of taste

182
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,260
receptors within even a
single taste bud is such

183
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,600
that every part of
the tongue mucosa can

184
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,420
taste any of these
five taste categories.

185
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,500
Different nerves
convey taste to the

186
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,120
brain from different
parts of the tongue.

187
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,380
The posterior one
-third of the tongue

188
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,880
uses the glossopharyngeal
nerve, cranial

189
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,180
nerve 9, to convey
taste information.

190
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:51,220
A small portion of
the posterior part

191
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,120
of the tongue, as
well as bits of the

192
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,480
oral soft palate and
pharynx, have their

193
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,200
taste information
conveyed to the brain

194
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,520
via the vagus nerve,
cranial nerve 10.

195
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,640
By far the largest
contributor to gustation

196
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,400
is the facial nerve.
This nerve conveys

197
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,060
taste information to
the brain from the

198
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:10,380
anterior two-thirds of
the tongue via a special

199
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,820
branch of facial
called corda tympani.

200
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,280
We briefly covered
the course of

201
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,220
corda tympani in my
previous lecture.

202
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,280
The nerve travels
through the middle

203
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,480
ear cavity and
exits the skull

204
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,560
through the petro
-tympanic fissure.

205
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,360
From here, corda
tympani hitches a

206
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,060
ride with the lingual
nerve, cranial

207
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:30,280
nerve 5-3, to
reach the tongue.

208
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:32,560
As with the hypoglossal
nerve and the

209
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,420
cervical plexus,
even though both

210
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,540
lingual and
chordotimpany appear like

211
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,140
a single nerve at
this point, their

212
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,520
two epineural sheaths
remain separate.

213
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,180
So why is the
tongue this rich

214
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,020
tapestry of nerve
associations?

215
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,100
The answer has
everything to do with

216
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,030
how our tongue forms
embryologically.

217
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,260
The tongue starts
in the fourth

218
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,980
week as a series
of swellings from

219
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,980
the first four
pharyngeal arches.

220
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,800
Each pharyngeal arch
has a specific nerve

221
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,720
associated with it. As
the tongue develops,

222
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,440
it drags in contributions
from these four

223
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,660
different cranial
nerves. In the case

224
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,900
of chordotimpani, we can
see that the anterior

225
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,940
two-thirds of the
fully developed tongue

226
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:13,580
are covered by
trigeminal, not facial.

227
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,080
However, earlier
in development, the

228
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,700
facial nerve's
distribution was more

229
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,100
present thanks to
contributions of pharyngeal

230
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,140
arch 2 to the
developing tongue.

231
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,920
During this time, our
protochordotimpani

232
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,600
nerve splits off from
the protofacial nerve as

233
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,900
the pharyngeal arch
swellings are dragged,

234
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,060
the first pharyngeal

235
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,080
arch as the tongue forms.

236
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,700
Clinical correlate.
Taste is second only

237
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,340
to olfaction when
it comes to under

238
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,060
-representation in
medicine and research. The

239
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,860
biggest clinical
correlate associated with

240
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:46,160
gustation is agusia.
This is a loss of the

241
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,020
sense of taste, and
it often goes hand in

242
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,920
hand with anosmia.
Agusia has also seen a

243
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,260
relatively recent surge
in interest, as loss

244
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,460
of taste was another
factor commonly

245
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:58,140
associated with early
strains of a COVID-19

246
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,940
infection. Other ways
of acquiring agusia

247
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,780
include exposure to
toxic chemicals, illicit

248
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:06,200
drug use, or head
trauma, which can cause

249
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,780
a temporary or
permanent loss of taste.

250
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,520
The loss of a sense
of taste, as with the

251
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,480
loss of sense of smell,
can place a person

252
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,660
at risk for inadvertent
food poisoning as

253
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,940
they cannot taste food
that has gone bad.

254
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:20,880
Largely, agusia affects
the quality of life

255
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,840
for the patient as
the inability to taste

256
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,420
lowers hunger levels
and often leads to poor

257
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,420
nutrition as the
affected person may try

258
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,300
to compensate for a
weakened gustation by

259
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,640
substituting more salt
or sugar into their

260
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,680
food. Much like anosmia,
there are currently

261
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,540
few treatment options
available for agusia.

262
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,580
Smell and taste are
deeply intertwined

263
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,580
with one another. They
offer two different

264
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,380
means of analyzing
chemicals from

265
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:48,040
the environment, or
chemosensation. They

266
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,420
are also an example
of a coupled sense.

267
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,920
Coupled senses are
two or more senses

268
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,900
that work together
to perform a third

269
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,560
function. For olfaction
and gustation,

270
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,600
that third function is
the concept of flavor.

271
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,080
Although we typically
associate flavor with

272
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,020
just taste, true flavor
requires both the

273
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:08,900
sense of smell and the
sense of taste. It has

274
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,520
often been stated that
80% of flavor comes

275
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,040
from just the smell of
food alone, though as

276
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,040
far as I know there are
no real quantitative

277
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,360
measures behind that
statement. The importance

278
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,200
of smell in the
flavor of food can be

279
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,960
made obvious when a
person suffers from a

280
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,240
stuffy nose. Food eaten
during this time is often

281
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,540
considered bland and
pretty flavorless.

282
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,900
If you have used air
travel recently, then you

283
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,860
may have also noticed
that airplane food

284
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,840
is remarkably bland
despite its high salt and

285
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,500
sugar content. The
high altitude and heavy

286
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,860
air recirculation in
airplanes lowers the

287
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,560
ability to detect airborne
odorants, producing

288
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,680
a weakened sense of
flavor. You can test this

289
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,340
the next time you take
a trip on a flight

290
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,660
by holding on to some of
the snack food offered

291
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,880
to you on the plane
and tasting it some

292
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,620
10 to 20 minutes after
you have landed and

293
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:57,200
resettled your body.
The now grounded snack

294
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,540
items should taste
noticeably sweeter or saltier

295
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:03,260
compared to their
taste on the plane. The

296
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,460
coupling of smell and
taste occurs at multiple

297
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,120
sites of integration
in the brain,

298
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,880
including the thalamus
and orbitofrontal cortex.

299
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,800
You will learn more
about these structures

300
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,630
in neuroanatomy
next semester.

301
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:16,690
This brings us to
the end of video one.

1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,580
Special Afferents of the

2
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:03,880
Head and Neck, Video 2,

3
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:06,740
Cranial Nerve 2, Vision

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,460
This is, by far,
the most important

5
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,360
special afferent
that we have.

6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,960
Around 30-60% of
our brain is devoted

7
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,060
to processing
visual information.

8
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,900
The optic nerve
is similar to

9
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,280
the olfactory
nerve in that

10
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,420
it is also not
really a nerve.

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,260
As with our
olfactory stalks,

12
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,180
the optic nerve
is actually an

13
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:31,480
anterior extension
of the brain.

14
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,660
The optic nerve travels
rostrally in the

15
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,260
anterior cranial fossa
before exiting the

16
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,540
endocranium through
the optic canal. The

17
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,160
nerve ends in a large
evagination more

18
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,000
affectionately known
as the eyeball. That's

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,480
right, our eyes are
both special afferent

20
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,500
organs and the terminal
nerves of the optic

21
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,520
nerve. The eyeball can
be divided into three

22
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,380
layers, a fibrous
layer, a vascular layer,

23
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:01,500
and a neural layer.
The fibrous layer

24
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,660
of the eye consists
of the outside of the

25
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,700
eyeball itself. This
is called the sclera.

26
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,260
Anterior to the eyeball
is a specialized

27
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,760
part of the sclera
called the cornea.

28
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,940
The anterior portion
of the eye is housed

29
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,260
within an extraocular
compartment known

30
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:20,360
as the conjunctival
layer. This compartment

31
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,680
serves to hold and
moisten the eye.

32
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,160
Both the sclera and the
cornea are comprised

33
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,120
of the same collagen
fibers. The only

34
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,560
difference is that in
the sclera, all the

35
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,300
collagen fibers are
arranged in this helter

36
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,520
-skelter pattern,
resulting in the fibers

37
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,840
blocking all incoming
lights. In the cornea,

38
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:42,100
these same fibers
are all arranged

39
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,180
parallel to each other,
allowing light to

40
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,600
pass through the
translucent fibers and

41
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,340
into the eye. The
sclera is tough,

42
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,500
protecting structures
inside the eye and

43
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,600
blocking out light
from other directions.

44
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,320
It also serves as
the distal attachment

45
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,040
for all six of the
extraocular muscles.

46
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,200
The cornea is the window
for light to enter

47
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,680
in the eye. The fibers
of the cornea are

48
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,260
misaligned just enough
to block out the high

49
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,560
energy photons such
as those from most

50
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,780
ultraviolet rays. It
also acts as the main

51
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,420
refractor of light for
the eye. More on that in

52
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,000
a minute. Blood flow to
the sclera is sparse,

53
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,980
and the cornea
itself is completely

54
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,260
avascular, relying on
capillary beds, lacrimal

55
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,580
fluids, and aqueous
humor to bring nutrients

56
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:28,160
to the cells of the
cornea. Lastly, the

57
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,380
cornea is highly sensitive
to touch. The second

58
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,740
layer of the eye is
the vascular layer.

59
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,760
This consists of
the iris, ciliary

60
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,140
body, and the
choroid. The iris is

61
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,260
the most noticeable
part of the eye.

62
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,620
It lies just
anterior to the lens.

63
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,820
It makes the
color of the eyes,

64
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,260
and it is responsible for

65
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,260
changing the size
of the pupil.

66
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,020
The iris is comprised
of two different

67
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,180
muscles that form
a ring around the

68
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,880
pupil. The innermost
portion of the iris

69
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,500
houses the
constrictor muscle for

70
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,180
the pupil, known as
sphincter pupillae.

71
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,280
This is a ring of
smooth muscle that

72
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,840
is circularly arranged
around the pupil

73
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,180
and when contracted,
will shrink the

74
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:13,000
size of the pupil. It
is parasympathetically

75
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,900
innervated.
In this image,

76
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,020
sphincter pupillae is
partially covered by

77
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,520
another muscle, the
dilator pupillae.

78
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,740
This is a ring of
radially arranged smooth

79
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,340
muscle fibers that,
when contracted,

80
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,020
pull open the eye
equally from all

81
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,480
directions, resulting
in dilation.

82
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,500
the dilator pupillae is

83
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,000
sympathetically driven.

84
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,780
Now, due to the
radial orientation of

85
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,120
the muscle fibers,
the dilator pupillae

86
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,760
takes longer to contract
than its counterpart,

87
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,760
sphincter pupillae.
Or to put it

88
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,880
another way, you can
constrict your eyes

89
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,820
a lot faster than
you can dilate them.

90
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,260
Posterior to these
muscles is a very thin

91
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,320
layer of pigmented
epithelium. Iris

92
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,860
color is determined by
the amount of melanin

93
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,460
granules produced
by melanocytes in

94
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:03,440
this pigmented
epithelium. These cells

95
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,660
produce melanin, which
gets trapped between

96
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:08,020
the fibers of the
two iris muscles.

97
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,520
The more melanin
produced, the darker the

98
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,520
eyes are. Brown eyes
carry the most melanin

99
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,160
in their pigmented
epithelium, whereas green,

100
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,060
hazel, and blue represent
decreasing amounts

101
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,720
of melanin in that
pigmented epithelial

102
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,900
layer. The iris also
serves as a landmark,

103
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,020
demarcating the
end of the anterior

104
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:30,480
compartment of the eye.
The anterior compartment

105
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,900
of the eye contains
aqueous humor, which

106
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,060
maintains pressure
inside the eye and

107
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,380
helps distribute
nutrients to the cornea.

108
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,200
The ciliary body lies
posterior to the iris.

109
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,900
It is a muscular
ring located at the

110
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:47,440
corneoscleral junction.
The ciliary body is the

111
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,440
attachment site for
the lens, and it is

112
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,480
responsible for the
production of aqueous

113
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,720
humor in the anterior
compartment of the eye.

114
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,000
The lens is attached
to the ciliary body via

115
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,740
a collection of fibers
known as zonular

116
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:05,040
fibers, or the zonule
of Zinn, which sounds

117
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,740
like a Lord of the
Rings or Game of Thrones

118
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,860
character. When the
ciliary body is at rest,

119
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:12,580
the zonular fibers are
taut and pull on the

120
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,820
lens, changing its
shape by making it

121
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:18,120
thinner and straighter.
When the ciliary body

122
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,960
contracts, the zonular
fibers loosen and the

123
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,840
lens bounces back to
its natural biconvex

124
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,700
shape. This changing of
lens shape is important

125
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,640
for accommodation,
which will be covered

126
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,200
a little later in this
video. The ciliary

127
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,100
body receives
parasympathetic innervation.

128
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,760
The final layer of
the vascular layer is

129
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,920
the choroid. It
comprises the majority of

130
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,500
the posterior compartment
of the eye and is

131
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,160
the main source of
sustenance for structures

132
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,020
inside the eyeball.
It is a dark,

133
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:53,280
reddish-brown layer. The
red in red-eye pictures

134
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,460
from cameras is the
choroid reflecting

135
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,700
back through the lens.
The choroid consists

136
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,540
of an extremely dense
mesh of capillaries

137
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:04,000
that deliver nutrient
-rich blood to the

138
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,460
retina. The choroid
is tightly attached

139
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:09,020
to the posterior part
of the retina, but

140
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:12,120
only loosely attached
to the anterior part.

141
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,460
Attachment is
maintained by pressure

142
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,920
produced by the
vitreous humor, which is

143
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,300
a gelatinous mass
that fills up most of

144
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,420
the posterior
compartment of the eye.

145
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,700
The innermost layer of
the eye is the neural

146
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,700
layer, and it consists
of the retina. The

147
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,840
retina houses around
150 million different

148
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,900
neurons, and it can be
divided into a neural

149
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:37,180
layer, again, where the
light-sensitive rods

150
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:40,080
and cones reside, and
a pigmented layer that

151
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,120
helps reduce the
scatter of light around

152
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,360
the photoreceptors of
the retina. Due to a

153
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,680
fluke of our embryology,
the neural layer of

154
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,420
the fetal retina in humans
and other vertebrates

155
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,200
differentiates
backwards. The light

156
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,180
-sensitive rods and cones
lie deep to the bipolar

157
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,820
interstitial neurons
and ganglionic cells,

158
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,660
which are in direct
line of sight of the

159
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,500
light rays. This means
light has to pass through

160
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,240
this mesh of extra,
non-light-sensitive

161
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,200
material before it hits
our photoreceptors.

162
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,900
For comparison,

163
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,880
the convergently
evolved eyes of

164
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,120
cephalopods, such as
octopus and squid, have

165
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,180
their photoreceptors
arranged the opposite

166
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,300
way, so they are
the first structures

167
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,320
to come in contact
with light rays.

168
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,040
This roundabout way
of getting light

169
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,820
information back to the
brain has produced two

170
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,000
important anatomical
structures within

171
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,880
the eye. One structure
can be seen at the

172
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,400
convergence of all the
neurons of the optic

173
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,460
nerve. This is called
the optic disc, and

174
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,520
it is so dense with
neurons that light

175
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,980
cannot effectively
********* it, resulting

176
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:45,540
in no photoreceptors
being placed there.

177
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,000
This forms a
blind spot in our

178
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,540
eye. To offset
this, our brains

179
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,340
incorporate some
post-production

180
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,640
trickery to fill
in that blind spot.

181
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,260
On the opposite
end is the macula

182
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:00,060
lutea. This is a
small depression in

183
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,360
the neural layer
formed by the sloping

184
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,800
of the non
-photoreceptor cells away

185
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,780
from the angle of
incoming light.

186
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,280
At the center of
the macula lutea,

187
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,520
the sloping of the
non-photoreceptive

188
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,300
cells produces
the most direct

189
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:16,120
access to light for
our photoreceptors,

190
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,120
resulting in the
clearest vision.

191
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,800
This area is called the

192
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,400
fovea or fovea centralis.

193
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:25,580
Here we see a
histological

194
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,260
slice through the fovea.

195
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,080
Even though most of
the non-photoreceptive

196
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,520
cells have been
pushed to the

197
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,200
side, there is still
a hefty amount of

198
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,580
non-photoreceptive
mesh to cut through

199
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,880
before reaching
these photoreceptors.

200
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:42,060
Whenever you focus
on an object, you

201
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,860
turn your eye towards
it so that the

202
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,520
image of the object
hits your fovea.

203
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,340
This behavior is
called foveation.

204
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:52,140
Both of these ocular
structures can

205
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,730
be viewed with an
ophthalmoscope.

206
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:56,600
The optic disc will
always pop out,

207
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,380
whereas the macula,
because there are

208
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,480
no blood vessels
directly in it, will

209
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,440
often look like a
faint, dark disc.

210
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,400
An important function
of the eyes is the

211
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,960
ability to change the
focal point based on where

212
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,480
an object is in three
-dimensional space.

213
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,360
This is called
accommodation.

214
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,920
To get a focused
image on the back

215
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,380
of our eyes, light
rays need to be bent

216
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,760
into focus as they
enter the eye.

217
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,020
This is done
via refraction.

218
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,420
Light refraction in
the eye is a two-part

219
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,560
process that starts
when light passes

220
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,700
through the cornea. The
cornea is the largest

221
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,120
contributor to
refraction in the eye.

222
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,000
It is responsible
for two-thirds of the

223
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,760
bending of light rays
to focus an image.

224
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:42,380
The remaining one
-third comes from the

225
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,940
lens, which fine
-tunes the image to

226
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,360
hit the back of the
eyes just right.

227
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,340
The lens by itself is

228
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,040
spherical and elastic.

229
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,200
To adjust the
focal point of the

230
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,300
eyes, the lens
must be deformed.

231
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,600
Objects that are far
away reflect parallel

232
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,580
light rays. To focus
on them, the lens needs

233
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:04,020
to be stretched and
made thinner. This

234
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,600
reduces its refractive
power, allowing only

235
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,340
for a slight bend to
incoming light rays.

236
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,160
This action is
largely done passively

237
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,260
as the tension of
the zonular fibers

238
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,900
pulls on the lens,
thinning it out.

239
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,140
Objects that are close
to the eye reflect

240
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:23,280
divergent light rays,
requiring a wider lens

241
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,200
to more strongly bend
the light into focus.

242
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,940
This is an active
process from our eyes,

243
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,880
as parasympathetic
innervation from the

244
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,300
oculomotor nerve,
via the short ciliary

245
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,640
nerves, is required
to stimulate

246
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,620
contraction of the
ciliary body and loosen

247
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:41,500
the zonular fibers,
allowing the lens to

248
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,120
return to its normal,
spherical shape.

249
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,780
And this is
the part where

250
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:46,780
it gets counterintuitive.

251
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,740
Because the act
of changing the

252
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,980
lens shape is
a passive one.

253
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,260
No nerve stimulation
is required to

254
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,340
focus on objects
in the distance.

255
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:00,320
In contrast,
returning the lens to

256
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,120
its normal spherical
shape requires

257
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,420
the eye to contract
the ciliary body

258
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,840
and loosen those
zonular fibers.

259
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,420
This is why our
eyes get tired

260
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,440
after reading or
staring at a screen

261
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,540
for a long time.
the ciliary body

262
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,480
has been contracted
for too long.

263
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:19,520
Since light typically
travels in a straight

264
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,680
line and the retina
covers the entire

265
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,020
back half of our
spherical eye, our retina

266
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,540
and vision are actually
broken into two

267
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,940
hemispheres per eye.
The retina is divided

268
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,660
into a temporal
hemiretina that covers

269
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,860
the side of the eye
closest to the temporal

270
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,680
bones and a nasal
hemiretina that covers

271
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,840
the side of the eye
closest to the nose.

272
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,100
This divides our
visual field into a

273
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,480
temporal visual field
that covers the half

274
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,320
of our vision closest
to the side of

275
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,100
our face, and a nasal
visual field that

276
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,040
covers light rays
coming closer to the

277
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,320
nose. You will go
into much more detail

278
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,560
on vision later
during neuroanatomy.

279
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,960
For now, the big takeaway
from this picture

280
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,600
is that each hemiretina
receives light

281
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,180
input from the opposite
visual field. For

282
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:11,480
example, the nasal visual
field will send light

283
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,320
rays to the temporal
hemiretina, and vice

284
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,420
versa. If you find
yourself confused by

285
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:20,340
this, remember to view
light rays as traveling

286
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:23,440
in straight lines, and
just draw a straight

287
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,560
line into the eye
from any visual angle.

288
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,180
Neurons from each
hemiretina travel

289
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:31,340
back to the brain
differently. While

290
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,540
all the optic neurons
pass through this

291
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,860
junction, called
the optic chiasm,

292
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,220
only the neurons
from our nasal

293
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:41,360
hemiretinas cross
over, or decasate,

294
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,460
at the chiasm,
and then travel to

295
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:45,720
the contralateral
side of the brain.

296
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,500
Again, this is a
relatively brief summary

297
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,560
of vision. You will
learn much more

298
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,020
about this in neuroanatomy
next semester.

299
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:56,940
Clinical correlate.
As our most important

300
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,380
special sense, there
are no shortage of

301
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:02,200
clinical correlates for
vision. By far the most

302
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,640
common is simply the
effects of age. As

303
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:08,360
we age, our lenses
lose their elasticity,

304
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,620
making it harder for
the lens to bounce back

305
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:13,460
to its original,
spherical shape, which is

306
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,020
necessary for looking
at close-up objects.

307
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,940
Even though we use
muscular contraction to

308
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,520
look at objects that are
close up, the contraction

309
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,800
only loosens the
attachments of the

310
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,500
zonular fibers. There is
no way for our body to

311
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,820
force our lens to
return to its original

312
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,920
shape once that elasticity
has started to go.

313
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,000
We've all seen
parents, grandparents,

314
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,280
and professors do
the pull-object

315
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,180
-away-from-face
technique to read the

316
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:43,700
words. This is a
behavioral adjustment

317
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,600
for the reduced
close-up vision.

318
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:48,080
Treatment is
typically glasses or

319
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,580
contacts, with the
relatively new ability

320
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,760
to use multifocal
presbylasic as a way

321
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,780
to change the
cornea's refractive

322
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:58,460
ability to accommodate
the stiffer lens.

323
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,780
As with the rest
of the body,

324
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,720
the lens is
comprised of cells.

325
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,320
Normal wear and tear
causes the breakdown of

326
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,960
proteins in these cells.
As we age, the rate

327
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,280
of repair to these
denatured proteins starts

328
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,920
to diminish, resulting
in the lens thickening

329
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,320
with what amounts
to cellular garbage.

330
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,580
Eventually, this
thickening can lead

331
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:21,720
to a cloudiness
called a cataract. If

332
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,320
left untreated,
the cataract will

333
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,680
eventually cause
blindness as it diffuses

334
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,100
more and more light
across the retina.

335
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,840
Cataracts can be
exacerbated by other

336
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,340
underlying
problems such as

337
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:35,240
hypertension, poor
nutrition, and smoking.

338
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,080
Cataracts also have
a strong genetic

339
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,620
component to them
and can be brought

340
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,800
on by other congenital
disorders such

341
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,420
as Down syndrome or
Turner's syndrome.

342
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:47,620
In all cases, cataracts
require surgical

343
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,840
intervention to fix.
This is usually done via

344
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,180
a partial or total lens
replacement depending

345
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,500
on the degree of
cataract cloudiness.

346
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:58,420
In a healthy person,
aqueous humor is

347
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,080
continuously produced
by the ciliary

348
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,560
body and distributed
across the anterior

349
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,400
chamber of the
eye where it will

350
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,000
drain from the
scleral venous sinus,

351
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,300
which is otherwise known

352
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,240
as the canal of Schlem.

353
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,860
Aqueous humor is
important for proper

354
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,620
nutrition to the
cornea, and when that

355
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,680
flow pattern gets
blocked, the humor can

356
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,060
start to stagnate
and become cloudy.

357
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,980
This cloudiness is
called glaucoma,

358
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,620
and it's usually
caused by a

359
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,760
blockage of that
drainage system.

360
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,720
There are two common
forms of glaucoma.

361
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,540
Open-angled glaucoma
has the scleral venous

362
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,540
sinus blocked by some
of the trabecular

363
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,540
meshwork comprising
the canal itself.

364
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,840
This can lead to a
slow-forming glaucoma.

365
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,480
The second form
is called closed

366
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,860
-angle glaucoma,
and it is caused by

367
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,960
the angle between
the iris and scleral

368
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,940
venous sinus
being too acute.

369
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:50,880
blocking access to
the canal entirely.

370
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,860
Closed angle glaucoma
is usually more of

371
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:56,180
a medical emergency
than open angle as

372
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,380
the pressure buildup
happens a lot faster.

373
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,640
Finally, we have
retinal detachment.

374
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,300
Remember that the
retina forms two layers,

375
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:07,000
a pigmented layer
next to and tightly

376
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,440
adhered to the choroid,
and a neural layer

377
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,340
that has the
photoreceptors on it. The

378
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,780
neural layer is not
tightly adhered and

379
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:18,020
requires constant
pressure from the aqueous

380
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,500
and vitreous humor
to maintain contact

381
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,820
with the capillary
bed of the choroid.

382
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,600
Any type of eye
damage that reduces

383
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,820
intraocular pressure
puts the retina at risk.

384
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,020
Patients who suffer
retinal detachment

385
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,200
complain of flashes
of light or of

386
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,540
constant specks of
light in their vision.

387
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,080
Retinal detachment is
considered a medical

388
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,060
emergency as the
neural layer of the

389
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,520
retina is very
intolerant of hypoxia

390
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,040
and cell death can
happen very quickly.

391
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:49,140
This brings us to
the end of video two.

00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,420
The vestibulocochlear
nerve comes off the

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,500
pond's medulla junction
and follows the

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,840
facial nerve out of
the endocranium via

7
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,040
the internal acoustic
meatus. The nerve

8
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,920
starts as a single
structure leaving the

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,060
brain, but it quickly
splits into two

00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,440
nerves as it reaches
its destination within

11
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,740
the inner ear. These
two nerves are the

12
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:32,560
vestibular nerve and
the cochlear nerve.

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,580
The vestibular nerve
handles the vestibular

14
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,040
system, the area
associated with balance,

15
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,520
whereas the cochlear
nerve covers the

16
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,600
cochlea, which is
the organ of hearing.

17
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,800
Although both vestibulocochlear
and facial enter

18
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,480
the internal acoustic
meatus, only the

19
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,100
facial nerve exits
the skull. The

20
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,860
vestibulocochlear nerve
only goes as far as the

21
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:57,340
inner ear. The nerve
splits into finer nerves

22
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,540
that receive sensory
information from a

23
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:02,420
specialized organ
called the otic capsule.

24
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,560
The otic capsule
consists of a bony or

25
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,780
endosseous labyrinth.
This is a set of cavities

26
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,160
filled with a fluid
called perilymph.

27
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:14,040
Perilymph has a
consistency similar to

28
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,100
most extracellular
fluids. Just deep to

29
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,180
the perilymph covered
endosteous labyrinth

30
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,200
is a secondary
structure called the

31
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,880
membranous labyrinth.
This is where the

32
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,340
hearing and balance
organs really function.

33
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,180
The membranous
labyrinth is filled

34
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,180
with endolymph, a
positively charged

35
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,220
substance similar to
intracellular fluid.

36
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,900
The membranous
labyrinth can be divided

37
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,720
into the vestibular
organ and the cochlea.

38
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,080
The vestibular organ
provides our sense

39
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,860
of balance and direction.
It is comprised

40
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,040
of two different
structures, the

41
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,120
otolith organs and the
semicircular canals.

42
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:52,260
There are two
otolith organs,

43
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,800
the utricle and the
saccule. They are

44
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,740
responsible for
detecting change in

45
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:01,020
direction. They do
this via two expansions

46
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,960
of the bony labyrinth
that house many

47
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,180
small calcifications
called otoliths.

48
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,820
Otolith, literally
translated,

49
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,100
means ear rock.
These little

50
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,160
calcifications give
weight to the gelatin

51
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,580
inside the saccule
and utricle.

52
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,600
Embedded within
that jelly are

53
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,740
the cilia of
sensory neurons.

54
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,760
The utricle is aligned
horizontally in

55
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,960
the head with the
sensory neurons placed

56
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,560
along the floor of
the utricle in an area

57
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,720
called the macula.
This lets the utricle

58
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,240
act as a horizontal
acceleration sensor,

59
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,680
letting us know
where our head is in

60
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,840
space. Data from the
utricle is compared to

61
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,800
semicircular canal
data to further

62
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,960
determine where our head
is oriented. We will

63
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,120
cover the semicircular
canals in a bit.

64
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,740
The saccule has a
similar construction

65
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:51,120
as the utricle,
but it is placed on

66
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,280
the medial wall
of the vestibular

67
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,040
organ. The saccule
detects vertical

68
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,540
motion and acts as
our gravity sensor.

69
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,160
Lastly, we have the
semicircular canals.

70
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,460
These provide
information on head

71
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:07,700
tilt and position
in space. We have

72
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:11,020
three semicircular
canals, the anterior,

73
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:14,700
posterior, and lateral
semicircular canal.

74
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,220
The anatomy of all three
canals is the same.

75
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,260
Each canal is filled
with endolymph, and

76
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:24,240
each canal ends in an
expanded section called

77
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,280
the ampulla. Inside
the ampulla resides

78
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,180
the ampullary crests,
or crista ampullari.

79
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,240
These crests protrude
into the membranous

80
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,920
labyrinth and house
multiple stereocilia

81
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,660
attached to sensory
neurons. Each semicircular

82
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:42,220
canal works as a pair
with a semicircular

83
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,560
canal from the other
side of the head.

84
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,560
This allows us to
accurately determine our

85
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,420
head rotation and
orientation in space.

86
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,040
The three opposing
pairs of semicircular

87
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,040
canals are the left
and right horizontal,

88
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,640
the right anterior
and left posterior,

89
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,140
and the left anterior and

90
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:06,020
right posterior
semicircular canals.

91
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,400
As the head rotates
in space, these three

92
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,820
semicircular
canals switch their

93
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,320
endolymphatic fluid
around, pushing on the

94
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,780
ampullary crests and
bending them one way

95
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:19,440
or the other. This
bending causes

96
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,500
depolarization of afferent
neurons on the side

97
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,660
that the head is
turning towards, while

98
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,260
hyperpolarizing,
or inhibiting, the

99
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:30,080
aferrit neurons on the
contralateral side.

100
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:33,260
This asymmetric
firing of neurons

101
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,660
allows the brain
to determine

102
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,460
which way the
head is turning.

103
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,920
These movements can

104
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,500
seem confusing at first.

105
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,180
The key part to
remember is that your

106
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,760
brain is just measuring
the difference in

107
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,150
signal intensity
between the paired

108
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:51,180
semicircular canals in your
head. So, for instance,

109
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,480
if you turn your
head to the left,

110
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,860
then your left
horizontal semicircular

111
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,860
canal would increase
signal intensity, whereas

112
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,200
your right horizontal
semicircular

113
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,120
canal would decrease
its signal intensity.

114
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,440
The second portion of the

115
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,420
otic capsule
is the cochlea.

116
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,040
Cochlea means
spiral, and it earned

117
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,480
its name from
the snail shell

118
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,340
shape that it
takes in the ear.

119
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,320
As part of our
hearing system,

120
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,880
the cochlea sends all its

121
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,720
information to the
cochlear nerve.

122
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,360
Inside the cochlea,
the membranous

123
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,100
labyrinth continues as
the spiral ligament,

124
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,540
and within the
spiral ligament is

125
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:30,160
the endolymph-filled
cochlear duct.

126
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,880
The walls of the spiral
ligament create a

127
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,000
barrier that separates
the rest of the

128
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,220
endosseous labyrinth
into two channels, the

129
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:41,400
perilymph-filled scala
vestibuli and scala

130
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,420
tympani. To understand
how sound travels

131
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,360
through the cochlea,
we have to start in

132
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,400
the middle ear. At the
tympanum, sound waves

133
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,760
shake the tympanic
membrane, transmitting

134
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,640
those sound waves
to the attached ear

135
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:57,900
ossicles, the malleus,
incus, and stapes. It

136
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,680
is at the footplate
of the stapes that

137
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,140
the sound waves reach
the cochlea. The

138
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:04,820
footplate of the stapes
taps on a special window

139
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,380
on the cochlea called
the oval window.

140
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:11,040
This sends a pressure
wave into the perilymph

141
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,020
of the endosseous
labyrinth through the

142
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:16,100
scala vestibulae. This
pressure wave distorts

143
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,540
the cochlear duct,
stimulating afferent

144
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,960
neurons placed in a
specialized region of

145
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,180
the duct called the
organ of corti. This

146
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,560
structure houses sensory
neurons with cilia

147
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,500
encased in jelly similar
to the otolith organs

148
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,880
and the ampullary crests
of the semicircular

149
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,900
canals. These
neurons depolarize at

150
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,060
different harmonic
frequencies, sending their

151
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,280
information back to
the brain via the

152
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,060
cochlear nerve. That
pressure wave is then

153
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,220
translated to the other
channel, the scala

154
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,920
tympani, where its energy
is eventually released

155
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,340
through the round
window of the cochlea.

156
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:52,120
This is all a very
basic rundown of

157
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,120
sound transduction,
which you will learn

158
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,840
more about in
neuroanatomy. The

159
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,000
frequency of sound waves
entering the middle

160
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,260
ear determine how
far up the spiral

161
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,980
cochlea that sound
wave will go. Lower

162
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:06,240
sounds travel further
up the spiral.

163
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,480
Due to the large size
difference between our

164
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,700
tympanic membrane and
the footplate of the

165
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,840
stapes, all sounds get
naturally amplified

166
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,680
on their way to the
cochlea. To keep from

167
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,240
destroying the cochlear
membrane with very loud

168
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,040
sounds, we have two
built-in safeties. Those

169
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,280
two little ear muscles
we talked about in

170
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,920
the previous lecture
series, tensor tympani

171
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:32,640
and stapedius. These
little muscles lock down

172
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,620
the ear ossicles and
dull incoming sounds.

173
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,260
Clinical correlate.

174
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:40,180
Hearing loss is,
of course, the most

175
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,560
common clinical case
associated with the

176
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,560
vestibulocochlear
nerve and the ear.

177
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,740
Hearing loss can be
congenital, or it can

178
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,700
be acquired from
being around very loud

179
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,140
noises for an extended
period of time.

180
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,480
Hearing loss can
be divided into

181
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,520
two types, conductive
hearing loss

182
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,940
and sensorineural
hearing loss.

183
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,520
Conductive hearing
loss affects the

184
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,220
middle ear and is a
problem with either

185
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,260
the tympanum or
the ear ossicles.

186
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:09,280
A perforated tympanic
membrane or scarring

187
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,360
around the ear
ossicles caused by an

188
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,240
untreated case of
otitis media can result

189
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,600
in dulled sounds
reaching the cochlea.

190
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:19,300
People with conductive
hearing loss typically

191
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,680
speak quieter than
normal as they hear

192
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,860
their own voice louder
than anything around

193
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:26,260
them. This type of
hearing loss can be

194
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,600
treated surgically or
with a hearing aid.

195
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,840
Sensory neural hearing
loss is another matter

196
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,360
entirely. It is a
problem with the inner

197
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,600
ear and can include
the loss of the sensory

198
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,240
hair cells in the
cochlea, or it can

199
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,540
incorporate the cochlear
nerve itself and any

200
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:44,040
of its relays along
the way to the brain.

201
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,520
Treatments require
cochlear implants. However,

202
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,620
even these implants
produce only crude

203
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,020
improvements compared
to natural hearing.

204
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,360
Tinnitus is by far the
most common hearing

205
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,620
problem, affecting
some 15-20% of the

206
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,140
U.S. population. It
is associated with

207
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,460
aging as hair cells
from higher frequency

208
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,780
regions of the cochlea
start disappearing.

209
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,440
The result is a
ringing sensation

210
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,620
in the ear whenever the

211
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,680
brain checks on
that frequency.

212
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,880
Tinnitus is not
actually a disease, but

213
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,420
instead is a symptom
of a larger problem.

214
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,060
Tinnitus can be acquired
earlier in life by

215
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,680
people living or working
in very loud areas.

216
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,520
The ringing is
constant and typically

217
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,140
does not require an
outside stimulus.

218
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,120
The rates of tinnitus
and sensorineural

219
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,100
hearing loss have
been on the rise

220
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,360
as an entire
generation has grown up

221
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,400
listening to music
through earbuds.

222
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,160
There has been
roughly a 30% increase

223
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,320
in hearing loss among
young adults over

224
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,740
the past 20 years.
The underlying problem

225
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:48,000
is that most
earbuds don't form a

226
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,240
tight seal around
the external auditory

227
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,760
meatus, resulting
in sound leaking out

228
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,840
into the world and
making sounds coming

229
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,500
from those earbuds
appear too quiet.

230
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,440
The response to this
is often to raise

231
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,620
the volume to a listenable
level, resulting

232
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,400
in high decibel
sound waves hitting

233
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,780
the ear for extended
periods of time.

234
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:11,220
The vestibular system
is not immune to

235
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:14,120
pathologies either. A
common pathology for the

236
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,640
vestibular system
is benign paroxysmal

237
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,880
position vertigo. This
pathology is caused when

238
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:23,360
otoliths break free
from the utricle. These

239
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,760
otoliths find their
way into one of the

240
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,180
semicircular canals,
where they push against

241
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,540
the ampullary crests,
producing conflicting

242
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:33,040
signals about head
position to the brain.

243
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,580
There are multiple
causes behind

244
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:38,780
BPPV, ranging from
head trauma to age

245
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,560
-related tissue
weakening to the most

246
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,900
common reason that
it just happens.

247
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,880
Patients with BPPV
experience intense

248
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,540
and debilitating
dizziness and nausea.

249
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,800
The effect can
last for minutes to

250
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,680
days and, in really
bad cases, months.

251
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:59,420
Most cases of BPPV
resolve themselves over

252
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:02,000
time as the free
-floating otoliths are

253
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,680
broken down and
reabsorbed by the body.

254
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,020
There are treatment
options that

255
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,940
can speed up this
process, such as

256
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,720
canolith
repositioning, which is

257
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,720
otherwise known as
the Epley maneuver.

258
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,980
This technique helps
to move the rogue

259
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:18,460
otoliths out of the
offending semicircular

260
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,760
canal and back into
the vestibule, where

261
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,780
they won't cause
vertigo and will get

262
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:26,300
reabsorbed faster. In
extreme cases, surgery

263
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,260
may be required
to free an otolith

264
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,680
that has gotten hung
up on a nerve bundle.

265
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:34,220
As with olfaction
and gustation,

266
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,200
the eyes and
vestibular system are

267
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,720
another instance
of a coupled

268
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,820
sense, the vestibulo
-ocular reflex.

269
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,480
This reflex is
necessary for

270
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,080
proper gaze
stabilization.

271
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,780
We are moving our
heads and bodies around

272
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:50,700
constantly. If our
eyes did not compensate

273
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,980
for the rotation
of our heads, the

274
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,000
world would look like
a bad found footage

275
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,320
movie. The vestibulo
-ocular reflex

276
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,800
uses information relayed
from the vestibular

277
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,940
system through the
vestibular nerve.

278
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,900
Balance information
passes through several

279
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,900
different nuclei
in the brain before

280
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,360
reaching the motor
nerves for the eyes.

281
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,720
These motor nerves
activate the appropriate

282
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,020
extraocular muscles
for each eye,

283
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,620
allowing our eyes to
compensate for the

284
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:20,180
jittery movements of
our heads and bodies,

285
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:22,600
and keeping our view
of the world stable.

286
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:25,000
You can test this
for yourself by

287
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,400
holding an object
in front of your

288
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,160
face and rotating
your head around

289
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,400
while focusing
on that object.

290
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,480
However, to really see
the vestibulo-ocular

291
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,620
reflex in motion, we
need to turn to birds.

292
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:39,660
Bird eyes are so large
relative to their

293
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,920
skull that the
extraocular muscles are

294
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,880
not able to do much
to adjust the eyes.

295
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,260
Birds compensate
for their lack

296
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,920
of eye movement
by turning their

297
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,760
entire heads to
see something.

298
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:54,080
To maintain gaze
stabilization, the vestibulo

299
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,460
-ocular reflex of birds
incorporates their

300
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:59,120
neck muscles, allowing
their extremely flexible

301
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,760
necks to act the same
way our extra-ocular

302
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,000
muscles act, leading
to this wonderful

303
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,500
example from a 2013
Mercedes-Benz commercial.

304
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:13,760
Clinical Coralip A
delay in the vestibulo

305
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,940
-ocular reflex
produces nystagmus,

306
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:18,380
or an unwanted
saccade of the eyes as

307
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,060
they attempt to
adjust to delayed

308
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,100
information from the
vestibular system.

309
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,060
Nystagmus can be
acquired through

310
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,900
alcohol and
heavy drug use.

311
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,920
Nystagmus is a
common symptom

312
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,620
looked for by
police when testing

313
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,610
to see if someone
is intoxicated.

314
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,580
Nystagmus can also be

315
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,960
acquired congenitally.

316
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,900
The majority of
nystagmus cases are

317
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,820
benign and do not
require medical

318
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,860
intervention. In
rare instances of

319
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,240
persistent debilitating
nystagmus, a

320
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,460
pharmacological
treatment can be offered.

321
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:50,180
This brings us
to the end of the

322
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:53,240
lecture and the
end of video 3.
