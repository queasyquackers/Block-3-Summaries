00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:03,690
Hello, everyone.
Welcome to my lecture,

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:06,810
Growth Divisions of
CNS, CNS representing

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,810
Central Nervous System.
Let's get started.

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,850
In this lecture,
we're going to learn

5
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:17,170
the major
organizations of the

6
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:20,110
human's nervous
system, as well as the

7
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:22,790
major functions of
each subdivision.

8
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,870
This is truly a
global overview.

9
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:29,430
Showing here on the
right, you can see it's

10
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,990
almost like a family
tree. So we're going

11
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,950
to cover this entire
tree with detailed

12
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:38,770
structures later on in
the next semester for

13
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:41,570
the Papam I. We have
not only the Neural

14
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,790
Anatomy Lab, but also
Neural Anatomy Lectures

15
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:49,010
for the entire first
block in January. So

16
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:52,550
over here, don't be
too stressed about the

17
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:55,110
detailed structures
since you're going to

18
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:58,330
learn those details
in the next semester.

19
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:02,250
and my requirement
for this lecture is in

20
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,590
the detailed session
objectives in the

21
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:08,270
cpg so make sure you
look at the cpg and if

22
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:11,670
it's anything not
very clear this book

23
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,830
notice essentials of
the human brain this

24
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:18,970
is available at our
library with an electronic

25
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:21,890
version so you can
click on the link

26
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:26,890
here to read the
book. Chapter three is

27
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:30,370
relevant to this
lecture. This is very

28
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:32,950
helpful. So highly
recommend this book.

29
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:36,670
So if you have time
to read it during

30
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:39,030
the break, it will
set a very good

31
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,490
foundation for next
semester's lectures.

32
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:42,970
Highly recommend.

33
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,090
Okay, let's look at
some fun facts about

34
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:51,890
brains first of all
you know the brains are

35
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:54,070
bilaterally symmetric
right you have the

36
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:57,270
two left and right
hemispheres and the

37
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:00,230
material feels soft
and like gelatin when

38
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:03,070
they're fresh of course
when you're looking

39
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:05,850
at the cadavers when
we take out the brains

40
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,950
then the brains actually
touch feels like

41
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:11,550
rubber pretty rough
that's because of the

42
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,430
fixation and the brains
are surrounded by

43
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:17,300
meninges and the
skull to protect them

44
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,270
and there's very
interesting gender and age

45
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:23,590
differences for the
for the weight of the

46
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:27,210
brain as you can see
here the females are

47
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:30,490
green and males are
blue you can see very

48
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:35,190
clearly that the you
know brain mass actually

49
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,990
increases with
age but it kind of

50
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:41,610
plateaued when we are
in the adolescent age

51
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:45,050
and it doesn't change
much in the adulthood

52
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,450
and there's a clear
difference between

53
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:50,550
male and female in
terms of their absolute

54
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:53,690
weight but when you
look at you know the

55
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:55,790
brain weight divided
by body weight you

56
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:58,370
know normalized by
the body weight the

57
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:00,970
females actually
has a little more uh

58
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:04,610
advantageous here you
can see in the earlier

59
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,550
year and also later
in life, they're

60
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:09,710
slightly higher in
terms of the proportion

61
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:14,450
of the body weight. So
if anyone tells you,

62
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:17,030
hey, males are
generally smarter than

63
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,890
females, you could
counter by this fact.

64
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:24,970
The nervous system can
be divided into the

65
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:28,210
central nervous system,
CNS and peripheral

66
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:32,590
nervous system PNS
so that's the biggest

67
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,730
categorization with
the CNS you can see the

68
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:39,670
color code is red or
pinkish red comprised

69
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:44,370
of a brain and spinal
cord with the *****

70
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:47,490
color coded as blue
you can see the nerves

71
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:53,210
as well as ganglia so
here for the CNS you

72
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:55,930
know brain also
comprised you can further

73
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:59,810
divide it into the
forebrain which is the

74
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:03,570
cerebrum and bedded
inside underneath the

75
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:07,250
cerebrum is a diencephalon
putting together as

76
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,770
a forebrain and then
you also have the

77
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:14,770
cerebellum that's
underneath the cerebrum and

78
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:18,370
then you would have a
brainstem brainstem is

79
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:21,130
in front of the
cerebellum connecting the

80
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:24,830
forebrain with the
spinal cord for the

81
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:27,930
peripheral nervous
system all of these blue

82
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:30,890
like the nerves are
part of the peripheral

83
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:33,330
nervous system even
including the cranial

84
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:37,130
nerves so the cranial
nerves are coming out of

85
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:40,130
the cranium you know
you can you can imagine

86
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:43,990
it's from the skull
originated and then

87
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:47,010
coming out to reach
the peripheral tissues

88
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:49,590
so they're still part
of the peripheral

89
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:52,110
nervous system even
though it's cranial nerves

90
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:55,170
and the spinal nerves
are stemming from

91
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:58,750
the spinal cord right
so different segments

92
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,690
of the spinal cord
you have spinal

93
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:04,950
nerves you also have
ganglia so ganglia is

94
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:08,790
where the cell body
is concentrated so

95
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:12,350
the nerves are formed
by the axons of this

96
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:15,370
of the neurons and
the ganglias are the

97
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:19,470
cell bodies, including
sensory motor

98
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:23,530
neurons, as well as
the autonomic neurons.

99
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:27,430
So the sensory neurons,
the very typical

100
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:30,470
example that I can think
of is called dorsal

101
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:33,930
root ganglia, DRG. So
the dorsal root ganglia

102
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:36,790
is located right
outside the dura of the

103
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:39,910
spinal nerve, very
close to the spinal

104
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:42,770
cord, but it's still
outside the CNS. It's

105
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:46,550
considered part of the
***** and so there are

106
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:49,950
sensory or motor neurons
located inside the

107
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:53,670
spinal cord or the
brain so uh you know so

108
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:57,150
the sensory motor
neurons is part of cns

109
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:01,230
part of the pns
similarly the autonomic

110
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:05,150
neurons also have you
know the preganglionic

111
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:08,830
neurons located inside
the cns and postganglionic

112
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:11,490
neurons are usually
located in the pns

113
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:16,210
and there's also a
enteric nervous system

114
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:19,550
enteric nervous system
is kind of special

115
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:22,970
i put a star there
because some resources

116
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:25,570
consider enteric
nervous system as part

117
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:29,330
of the autonomics but
then others consider

118
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:32,710
it's an independent
separate system so

119
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:34,910
enteric nervous system
are located inside

120
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:38,730
the gut so that's why
it's a typical pns

121
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,970
there's one exception
about the ganglia

122
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:46,990
called basal ganglia
so this basal ganglia

123
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:50,790
some sources call
it as a basal nuclei

124
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:53,490
because it's actually
inside the cns considered

125
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:56,830
part of the cns
rather than you know

126
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:59,570
other ganglia are all
the pns structures

127
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:02,710
we're going to talk
more in this next slide

128
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:09,790
the tissues in the cns
can be divided into

129
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:12,990
gray matter and white
matter so the gray

130
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:15,090
matter in the natural
color would be

131
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:18,730
grayish and darker than
the color of the white

132
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,930
matter so gray matter
is where the cell

133
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:24,670
bodies and dendroids
located versus the

134
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:27,710
white matter has the
myelin sheaths you know

135
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:30,130
large axons and the
myelin sheaths are

136
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:32,850
high fat so that's
why the color is white

137
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:35,210
showing here though
you can see the

138
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:38,270
gray matter is actually
a lighter color

139
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,990
compared to the
white matter is a

140
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:44,070
bluish black so this
is because of the

141
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:46,570
myelin stain to
bring out the myelin

142
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:48,390
really the myelinated

143
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:50,470
fibers of the
white matter

144
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,890
so the gray matter
can you know the most

145
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:57,930
commonly seen is called
cortex right you see

146
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:00,990
the contours located
in the cerebrum and

147
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:04,630
cerebellum and less
commonly you would have

148
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:08,950
nucleus or nuclei as
a pleural and then

149
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:11,750
you would also see
very rarely just one

150
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:15,310
called basal ganglia so
the basal ganglia you

151
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:18,090
know, uses the old
term that, you know,

152
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:20,190
ganglia is supposed to
be peripheral nervous

153
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:24,470
system tissues, but
now used just as, you

154
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,010
know, this one exception
as basal ganglia.

155
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:29,810
So some people do call
it a basal nuclei.

156
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:34,310
It's the same thing.

157
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:38,270
White matter referring
to a bunch of

158
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:43,250
myelinated exons, right?
So we can tell whether

159
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,130
there's this structure
is white matter

160
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:50,110
by these telltale
terms like tract,

161
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:53,930
lenticularis, fasciculus,
lamniscus, peduncle,

162
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:56,550
all of these actually
meaning something

163
00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:00,030
like a small bundle
and these bundles of

164
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:03,190
fibers or bundles
of axons are highly

165
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:06,890
myelinated And so here,
you know, just from

166
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:10,270
the term optic tract,
you would be able

167
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:13,090
to tell, okay, this
is the white matter.

168
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,450
So in the spinal
cord, it's the same

169
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:22,050
thing. You also see
the white matter,

170
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:25,370
which stained darker,
and the gray matter,

171
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:28,670
which stained, you
know, very light.

172
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:31,650
so basically the
gray matter is also

173
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:34,490
where the neuron
cell body is located

174
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,690
and also the
non-myelinated

175
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:40,150
dendrites but the
white matter is where

176
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:43,770
the myelinated
large fibers located

177
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:51,490
besides the gray
matter and white

178
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:54,490
matter there are also
a bunch of spaces

179
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:57,630
in the central
nervous system these

180
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:02,070
spaces including the
ventricles aqueduct

181
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:06,970
sulcus and cisterns
so showing here

182
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:09,970
you know between the
two different views

183
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:12,690
are the ventricles you
can see the lateral

184
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:16,610
ventricle you know
pretty big one this is

185
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:19,410
a side view and then
this is the anterior

186
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,010
posterior view you can
see the two very big

187
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:27,650
lateral ventricles
and also there are you

188
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:30,290
know four ventricles
total so the two

189
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:34,350
lateral ventricles that's
two and then we also

190
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:38,090
have the third
ventricles which is here

191
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:41,850
showing the middle
and then over here

192
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,190
is this one that's
the third ventricle

193
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:47,050
and then the fourth
ventricles is actually

194
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:50,630
going along the
brainstem so you can

195
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:53,430
see here that's the
fourth ventricle

196
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:56,270
so in between the
ventricles there's

197
00:10:56,270 --> 00:11:00,490
also aqueduct so
aqueduct is a tubing

198
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:05,390
in between the third
and fourth ventricle

199
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:08,230
so this is our aqueduct
connecting the third

200
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:11,230
and fourth ventricle
and you can see here

201
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:15,280
the fourth ventricle
has some holes and so

202
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,780
the two lateral ones
and then also there's a

203
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:23,630
center one that goes
along the spinal spinal

204
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:26,010
cord central canal so
it's connected with

205
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:29,490
the central canal here
and all the ventricles

206
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:32,130
are connected so the
lateral ventricles

207
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:36,750
between the two lateral
ventricles, they

208
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,610
both actually connect
with the third ventricle

209
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:43,850
over here called
the, like over here

210
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:46,470
showing, that would be
the interventricular

211
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:51,770
foramen. So you're going
to learn all of these

212
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:54,610
next semester, you know,
at the first month,

213
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:57,390
first block during
the neuroanatomy lab

214
00:11:57,390 --> 00:12:00,150
and then during that
neuroanatomy lectures.

215
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,450
So don't worry too
much about the details.

216
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:06,110
I just kind of wanted
to plant a seed here.

217
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:09,190
So these ventricles and

218
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:11,450
aqueduct are
all connected.

219
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:17,330
And inside are filled
with fluids. So the

220
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:21,030
fluid is called
cerebrospinal fluids or CSF.

221
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:26,490
So CSF actually is
produced by the ventricle

222
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:30,410
linings called
choroid plexus. So the

223
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:34,570
production of the CSF
is inside the ventricle,

224
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:40,310
and then it goes
outside along, you know,

225
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:43,720
these holes, right,
like these holes goes

226
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:47,790
to the subarachnoid
space, which is between

227
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:51,010
the arachnoid matter
and pure matter. so

228
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:54,350
this is the subarachnoid
space is filled by

229
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:57,710
the css so the entire
brain and spinal cord

230
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:00,610
are actually um you
know all the brain

231
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:05,170
tissue the cns tissues
are hanging inside or

232
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:08,430
floating inside the
cerebrospinal fluids

233
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:12,970
which is helping to
reduce the vibration you

234
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:15,590
know producing the
protection to the CMS.

235
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:20,350
We've learned about
the ventricles and

236
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:23,330
aqueduct in the last
slide. Once again, you

237
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:26,680
can see here the two very
big lateral ventricles

238
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:31,710
separated by this
fairly thin membrane

239
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:35,030
-like structure called
septum pellucidum.

240
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:39,330
And then also we
see this very big

241
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:42,830
space here. is a big
longitudinal fissure

242
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:45,790
that's a crack in
between the two

243
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:49,380
hemispheres, separating
the two hemisphere

244
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:52,430
left and right.
And we also have

245
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:56,670
the large lateral
sulcus located here.

246
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:59,190
So the lateral sulcus
on this side over

247
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:02,150
here. The lateral sulcus
is also called the

248
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:04,770
lateral fissure,
separating the frontal lobe

249
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:07,870
at the top and the
temporal lobe at the

250
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:12,050
bottom and so the last
one the cisterns are

251
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:15,390
formed in between
the brain tissues and

252
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:18,830
the and the skull
so you have multiple

253
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:22,510
cisterns inside the brain
so like these cracks

254
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:25,870
here all the cisterns
filled with the csf

255
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:31,510
So in this slide,
you can see the third

256
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:34,290
ventricle. You could
still see the two lateral

257
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:38,190
ventricles, just that
they are much smaller

258
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:41,170
since this is a different
cut of the brain

259
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:44,510
slice. And then you also
see a very small hole

260
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:48,870
here. That's our
aqueduct located at the

261
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:52,510
midbrain. And then you
would also see these

262
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:56,710
cisterns right so these
are the large space in

263
00:14:56,710 --> 00:15:00,110
between the brain
tissues and the skull so

264
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:05,730
that's the spaces well
we mentioned about

265
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:08,810
different directions
like anterior posterior

266
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:13,350
superior inferior now
let's get the clear

267
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:16,090
understanding about the
directions of the CNS

268
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:21,570
so showing here you can
see for a fish it has

269
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:25,230
a longitudinal axis right
so this longitudinal

270
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:28,870
axis can divide the
fish into different

271
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:33,790
areas so anterior and
rostral meaning toward

272
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:37,910
the nose and then
posterior and caudal

273
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:42,990
meaning toward the
tail so and then
the longitudinal

274
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:46,990
axis dividing the
top as superior or

275
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:50,830
dorsal and then the
bottom part is inferior

276
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:54,990
ventral. So this is
consistent among not only

277
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:58,330
fish, but also most
majority of the mammals,

278
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:01,210
you know, the quadrupeds.
They always have

279
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:05,630
these directions like
consistently defined.

280
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:10,190
However, for our
humans, we actually have

281
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:12,650
two different axis.
You can see the brain

282
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:16,330
has this longitudinal
axis that's parallel

283
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:19,130
to the ground, but
because we're walking,

284
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:22,710
stand up, right? So
our spinal cord, our

285
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:25,070
brainstem and spinal
cord actually have a

286
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:30,370
different axis, goes along
the body. So this axis

287
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:34,010
has almost 80 degree
angle from the brain

288
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:37,790
axis. So we call this
cephalic flexure.

289
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:42,490
Cephalic flexure making
the terms of directions

290
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:46,390
are very confusing.
So for the brain,

291
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:50,630
we still have very
similar direction terms,

292
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:54,430
like the anterior is
the same as racial,

293
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,190
meaning toward the
nose, right? And then

294
00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:00,770
posterior is the same as
caudal, meaning toward

295
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:04,830
the back of the brain.
And then superior

296
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:10,930
and dorsal as well as
inferior and ventral

297
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,110
are still the
same definition

298
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:15,290
as we have in the fish.

299
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:18,590
But at the spinal
cord and brainstem,

300
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:21,370
so along this
different axis,

301
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:26,490
now anterior and
ventral is actually the

302
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:29,960
same thing instead of
rostral. So anterior

303
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,250
is meaning in front
of the body, right?

304
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,870
So in front of the
body, it's underneath,

305
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,590
you know, this
relative to this

306
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,290
longitudinal axis,
it's underneath.

307
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:45,510
So anterior is equal
with the ventral

308
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:49,230
aspects and the
posterior is equaling

309
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:53,070
the dorsal aspects.
So this is the same

310
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:56,210
thing for the brainstem
and spinal cord.

311
00:17:56,210 --> 00:18:00,370
Now, the rostral
is actually defined

312
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:03,450
by toward the nose
or toward the brain,

313
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:06,530
and then the caudal,
meaning toward the

314
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:09,090
tailbone or toward
the lumbar region.

315
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:14,250
So, in summary, in
the brain, you still

316
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:18,400
have the dorsal and
superior equal together,

317
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,730
but then in the
brainstem and spinal

318
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:24,770
cord, the dorsal is
meaning posterior. So

319
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:29,110
that is a different
definition. So that's

320
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:32,690
why in the brainstem
and spinal cord, we

321
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:36,270
use a lot of the term
like racial and caudal

322
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,950
instead of using, you
know, anterior and

323
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:45,750
posterior. So that
is the general rule.

324
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:51,850
and there are three
planes of sectioning so

325
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:55,180
when we are trying
to slice the brain we

326
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:57,250
could do three different
directions you know

327
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:01,690
x y and z right so the
first way of cutting

328
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:04,690
is along the longitudinal
fissure so the

329
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:07,610
same way as if we cut
the brain into the two

330
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:11,090
left and right hemispheres
so this uh if we

331
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:13,310
cut it right in the
midline we call it mid

332
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:17,230
sagittal view if we
cut the brain like away

333
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:19,170
like parallel
to the midline

334
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:21,750
these would be
the parasatical

335
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:25,170
slices so that's
one direction

336
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:27,270
and then the
second direction

337
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:30,990
for the horizontal
that would be

338
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:33,260
you know like
this longitudinal

339
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:37,670
axis, you know, along
this or parallel to

340
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:40,890
this longitudinal axis.
So this would be our

341
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:44,640
horizontal slices.
So we slice the brain

342
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:49,190
parallel to this longitudinal
axis. And remember,

343
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:52,730
there is a cephalic
flexure here, right?

344
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:55,930
So for the brainstem
and spinal cord, the

345
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:59,910
longitudinal axis is
this direction so it

346
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:02,490
would be confusing if
we call it horizontal

347
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:06,390
sections so instead
we would call it axial

348
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:10,150
sections so the axial
sections would be along

349
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:14,570
this longitudinal axis
to slice it this way

350
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:19,030
so this is our horizontal
or axial sections

351
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:24,450
and then the third
one is you know we

352
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:27,470
slice the brain
perpendicular to this

353
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:31,850
longitudinal axis. So
basically, it's this

354
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:35,790
way, you know, going
from the front to the

355
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,970
back, you know, this is
anterior posteriorly.

356
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:41,450
If we make the
cut this way, then

357
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:44,730
these are coronal
sections. Again, for the

358
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:47,950
brainstem, if we're
cutting perpendicular

359
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:51,710
to our longitudinal
planes, these are called

360
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:56,330
transverse sections.
So transverse, or

361
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:58,930
we can call it cross
sections. They're

362
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:02,670
just not the exact
plane as either coronal

363
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:05,570
or horizontal. So for
brainstem and spinal

364
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:08,210
cord, they're just
called differently.

365
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:13,330
But here is our X, Y,

366
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:15,030
and Z different cutting.

367
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:19,270
let's take a close
look at the major

368
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:22,910
structures of the cns
as we mentioned before

369
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:26,430
the forebrain brain
stem and cerebellum

370
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:30,070
is forming the brain
right and then we

371
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:34,950
have this is our
brain and then we have

372
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:38,970
a long spinal cord
goes along the uh you

373
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:40,890
know from cervical
to the lumbar region

374
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:45,210
And so the brain is
formed by the forebrain,

375
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:48,810
brainstem, and
cerebellum. So the

376
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:52,930
forebrain is this
pinkish structure here.

377
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:57,570
So this entire area
is called forebrain.

378
00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:01,970
So within the forebrain
is actually formed

379
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:05,910
by the two cerebral
hemispheres, or we also

380
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:10,610
call it cerebrum. So
that's the pink color.

381
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:15,910
you also see this green
color right here in

382
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:19,230
the middle buried
deep in the core that

383
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:24,470
is our diencephalon so
showing here you know

384
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:26,570
since it's green i'm
going to use this

385
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:29,530
green lines showing
here the diencephalon

386
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:33,210
actually have three
major structures you can

387
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:36,710
see more clearly in
this mid-sagittal view.

388
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:39,850
So the center one is
called the thalamus,

389
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:43,390
and then you also
have the ones that

390
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:47,010
underneath the thalamus
is called hypothalamus,

391
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:50,770
and then you also have
the structure that's

392
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:54,730
kind of on top,
and also behind the

393
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:58,950
thalamus, that's the
epithelium. So these three

394
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:02,610
structures forming
the diencephalon here.

395
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:07,430
And so both the
diencephalon and the

396
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:11,590
cerebral hemisphere,
also called cerebrum,

397
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:14,710
forming the forebrain.
So that is the

398
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:17,690
entire structure.
This is our forebrain.

399
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:21,870
And the brainstem
is the structure

400
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:24,090
connecting the
forebrain with

401
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:26,110
the spinal cord.
So it's here

402
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:29,810
in this kind of
purplish color.

403
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:34,890
So the brainstem is
when we look at close

404
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:37,750
closely enough it has
three structures too

405
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:41,650
so this is our midbrain
and then the midbrain

406
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:44,070
has the two bumps
here that's kind of

407
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:47,390
give you the landmark
and then the big belly

408
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:50,710
that is our basal
pons so this is the

409
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:53,790
second part of the
brainstem is called pons.

410
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:55,610
And then the third
part is called

411
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:58,550
medulla. So medulla
is much more skinny.

412
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:01,690
It's connecting,
you know, very

413
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:04,690
smoothly to the spinal
cord down below.

414
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:07,210
So that's our brainstem,

415
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:08,570
the three major
structures.

416
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:13,500
And then you also have
the cerebellum. So

417
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:18,170
the cerebellum is
located behind the

418
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:22,410
brainstem and underneath
the cerebellum. And

419
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:25,670
so the cerebellum also
have two hemispheres.

420
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:28,090
It's called cerebellar
hemispheres.

421
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:32,790
And spinal cord is the
most straightforward

422
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:38,370
central nervous system
structure in the

423
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:41,670
clinical setting you would
rarely see the stained

424
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:45,610
sections but you would
more likely seeing

425
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:49,530
these mri images so
over here again this

426
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:53,430
is a mid-sagittal view
of the brain and then

427
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:56,810
so on the right side
this is the mid-sagittal

428
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:59,610
view of the brain and
the spinal cord so

429
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:02,490
you should be able to
identify the forebrain

430
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:05,510
which is you know the
cerebral hemisphere

431
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:10,510
plus the diencephalon
so this is our

432
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:14,650
diencephalon right in
the middle or the core

433
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:17,630
and then you have
the two big cerebral

434
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:20,010
hemispheres so
together it's called

435
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:23,450
forebrain and then you
also have the brain

436
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:28,030
stem uh which is here
right the three major

437
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:32,190
structures midbrain
palms and medulla

438
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:39,200
and you also have the
cerebellum underneath

439
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:44,910
the cerebrum and
behind the brain stem

440
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:48,990
and then of course you
have the spinal cord

441
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:52,710
so spinal cord is
this long structure

442
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:56,370
that's extended from
the brain stem so over

443
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:58,270
here same thing you
should be able to

444
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:02,890
identify all of these
brain structures now

445
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:06,170
let's zero in to take
a closer look at the

446
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:09,490
brain we can see
several major landmarks

447
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:11,930
separating brain
into different parts

448
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:15,250
first of all the
longitudinal fissure

449
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:18,010
separating the brain
into the left and right

450
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:22,870
hemisphere And then
with these other ones

451
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:26,090
like central sulcus
or central fissure,

452
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:28,630
lateral sulcus or lateral

453
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:31,130
fissure, dividing
the cerebral

454
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:34,170
hemispheres into
different lobes.

455
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:37,180
and we also have
this transverse

456
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,910
fissure which is
separating the

457
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:42,350
forebrain from
the cerebellum

458
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:46,870
all of these major
landmarks separating

459
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:51,010
you know the brain into
different divisions

460
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:58,010
when we peel off the
meninges we could

461
00:26:58,010 --> 00:27:02,350
see much clearer in
terms of these sulci

462
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:05,830
and gyra so this is
our central sulcus

463
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:08,110
right we mentioned
in the previous slide

464
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:11,990
so this is a very deep
groove and then uh

465
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:16,890
the the other one is
lateral sulcus so these

466
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:21,190
uh sulci are really uh
important in terms of

467
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:24,010
dividing the brain
especially cerebral

468
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:27,650
hemisphere into different
subdivisions. And then

469
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:30,930
these ridge regions,
so this one in front of

470
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:34,010
the central sulcus
is called pre-central

471
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:38,990
gyrus, and then the
ridge that's behind the

472
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,830
central sulcus, that
would be the post-central

473
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:45,710
gyrus. So those ridge
regions, you know the

474
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:49,940
gyri, are very important
to mediate different

475
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:52,070
functions so we're
going to go through

476
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:55,150
some major functions
in the following slides

477
00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:00,010
as you can see here
the central sulcus

478
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:02,930
and lateral sulcus
dividing the cerebral

479
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:06,590
hemisphere into frontal
lobe and parietal

480
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:11,510
lobe there is another
one here showing

481
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:16,730
from the occipital
notch and parietal

482
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:20,650
occipital sulcus kind
of have a hypothetical

483
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:25,110
line to dividing the
occipital lobe from

484
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:32,150
the temporal lobe
all right let's look

485
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:35,510
at the cerebral
hemisphere lobe by lobe

486
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:39,990
The first one is the
frontal lobe. So frontal

487
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:43,990
lobe, as you recall,
is actually defined

488
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:48,750
by this central sulcus.
So this entire area

489
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:51,530
before the central
sulcus is a frontal lobe.

490
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:55,840
So in this frontal
lobe, the most important

491
00:28:57,330 --> 00:29:01,770
functions are several.
So first of all, there

492
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:05,230
is a planning and
executive function. So

493
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:07,270
basically, you know,
what you're planning to

494
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:11,230
do, this is the frontal
lobe. And there's also

495
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:14,970
a very important
structure called primary

496
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:18,730
motor cortex. So the
primary motor cortex is

497
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:22,550
also, is located at
the precentral gyrus,

498
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:25,810
meaning before the
central sulcus, right? so

499
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:30,090
precentral gyrus here
and basically it's

500
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:32,730
controlling all the
voluntary movement of the

501
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:36,290
whole body so let's say
if you want to drink

502
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:40,990
a cup of coffee you
have to you know pour it

503
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:44,130
add whatever ingredients
and then bring

504
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:45,970
the cup to your mouth
and then drink it

505
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:49,150
right all of these
motor functions are

506
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:52,470
actually mediated by
this motor the primary

507
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:55,330
motor cortex at the
precentral gyrus.

508
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:59,610
There is also another
area that is very very

509
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:02,770
important called
prefrontal cortex. So the

510
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:08,090
prefrontal cortex
here is related very

511
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:12,150
importantly related to
the personality and it

512
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:15,970
produced that inhibition
type of function. For

513
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:18,510
example, if we need
to go to the bathroom

514
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:21,110
and then you know the
social situation doesn't

515
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:23,610
allow us, we're going
to hold it, right?

516
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:27,670
So if there is prefrontal
cortex damage, a

517
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:30,290
lot of times people,
you know, the adults

518
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:34,630
would not having that
type of inhibition and do

519
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:37,270
something that's not
appropriate in the

520
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:41,590
public. So the famous
patient, his name is

521
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:45,310
Phineas Gage. He's the one
that helped us discover

522
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:48,150
the function of this
prefrontal cortex.

523
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:51,790
And he's
actually defining

524
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:54,970
this frontal lobe for us.

525
00:30:55,810 --> 00:31:00,290
Fenus Gage had a really
horrible accident.

526
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:04,510
He was a railroad
worker. And at one

527
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:08,630
time, one of the
railroad one of the rails

528
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:13,230
like a stick up and
then this metal bar

529
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:17,630
crossed his face you
know penetrating from

530
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:20,670
his cheek and then
exiting from the top

531
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:23,730
of his skull and
completely damaged his

532
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:27,610
prefrontal cortex you
can see here an image

533
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:30,970
shown in the Harvard
Courtway Library

534
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:35,950
this Mr. Gage, he actually
survived, luckily,

535
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:39,150
actually lived for
more than 10 years

536
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:42,250
after this horrible
accident. However, his

537
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:45,290
mother, his family
members all said he's

538
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:47,670
becoming a different
person altogether.

539
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,090
Now let's look at
the parietal lobe.

540
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:57,330
As we mentioned
before, the central

541
00:31:57,330 --> 00:32:00,170
sulcus is a landmark
separating the

542
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:02,890
frontal lobe from
the parietal lobe.

543
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:06,490
So the parietal lobe,
one of the major,

544
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:09,050
major structure is
called postcentral

545
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:12,430
gyrus and this is behind
the central sulcus,

546
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:15,670
right? So postcentral
gyrus. It has

547
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:20,490
the primary somatosensory
cortex and this

548
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:22,910
somatosensory cortex
receives all the

549
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:25,490
sensory information
from the entire body.

550
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:29,650
In the parietal
lobe, this area is

551
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:32,010
called the sensory
association area.

552
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:34,870
It helps with the
spatial awareness.

553
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:40,150
The vision function
is located at the

554
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:43,310
back of the brain
called occipital lobe.

555
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:47,770
And right here,
alongside two banks,

556
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:48,670
you know, the
upper and lower

557
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:52,190
banks of this calcary
sulcus is called,

558
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:54,770
it's the primary
visual cortex.

559
00:32:57,930 --> 00:33:01,070
And the auditory
cortex is actually

560
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:03,870
located in the
temporal lobe. So as we

561
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:05,290
mentioned before,
the temporal lobe

562
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:11,010
is below the lateral
sulcus and has the

563
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:14,570
auditory primary
cortex as well as

564
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:17,670
some very important
limbic structures.

565
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:23,690
The two very important
limbic structures

566
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:27,390
are called amygdala
and hippocampus.

567
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:29,890
As you can see here,
this is a parasitical

568
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:33,750
brain slice showing
the hippocampus.

569
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:37,570
It's a long
structure at the

570
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:41,680
medial temporal lobe.
and also amygdala

571
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,350
looks like an
almond shape.

572
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:47,950
Both are very important
limbic structures.

573
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:50,170
Hippocampus is
very important

574
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:51,730
for learning and memory,

575
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:55,270
and amygdala is a very
important structure

576
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:59,350
for emotional sensation
like fear or anger.

577
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:02,030
If you have lesions
there, then the person

578
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:05,230
will not have the
normal fearful response.

579
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:10,670
I'd like to
highlight some

580
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:13,430
language areas that
not just belong

581
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:17,250
to one lobe
but it's a very

582
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:20,990
prominent at the
exterior side of the

583
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:24,990
cerebral hemispheres.
As you can see here we

584
00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:29,910
have Broca's area and
Wernicke's area. So

585
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:32,550
Broca's area is mainly
at the frontal lobe

586
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:35,450
and Wernicke's area
is mainly at the

587
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:38,430
temporal lobe and part
of the parietal lobe.

588
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:44,570
Broca's area at
the frontal lobe,

589
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:48,050
that is close to
the primary motor

590
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:50,810
cortex at the
precentral gyrus.

591
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:54,030
And so you can remember
that Broca's area

592
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:56,630
is causing, you know,
the lesion to this

593
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:59,490
area is causing production
of spoken language

594
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:02,130
deficit. So the person
would be able to

595
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:05,290
understand another
person's spoken language,

596
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:08,510
but just cannot respond
as they want. So

597
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:10,630
they know it in the
brain, they know the

598
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:14,210
answer, just could not
say it out smoothly.

599
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:17,910
As we mentioned earlier,
the Wernicke's area

600
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:20,630
is at the temporal
lobe, maybe extended

601
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:23,410
a little bit to the
parietal lobe too, at

602
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:26,530
the superior temporal
gyrus. So this area

603
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:30,030
lesion will cause
Wernicke's aficia, which

604
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:33,850
is also called receptive
official that means

605
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:38,270
the person cannot
understand the conversation

606
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:41,350
so they can speak
but what they talked

607
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:44,170
about does not usually
make sense so they

608
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:46,990
have problem with
comprehending the language

609
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:50,390
and making effective
communications but

610
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:52,990
they can talk so they
don't have the fluency

611
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:56,050
issue but they have
you know their word

612
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:59,970
just doesn't make sense
i'm including links

613
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:02,610
of the two videos
here that you guys can

614
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:06,150
look at it online and
to see really what the

615
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:08,570
characteristics of
these two different

616
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:13,490
types of aphasia. Very
distinct differences.

617
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:19,170
A special part
of the cerebral

618
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:22,670
hemispheres that is
not visible from the

619
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:24,970
outside or exterior
side of the cerebral

620
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:27,910
hemisphere is
called limbic lobe.

621
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:31,810
So the limbic lobe
comprises of cingulate

622
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:35,410
cortex, this purple
color surrounding

623
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:38,090
the corpus callosum
here in the middle,

624
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:43,410
and also hippocampus
that's buried inside

625
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:46,290
the hippocampal
gyrus, as well as the

626
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:49,430
amygdala that's also
at the very medial

627
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:52,450
aspect of the temporal
lobe. So these are

628
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:54,630
the main structures
of the limbic lobe

629
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:58,250
that is controlling
the emotional responses

630
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:02,490
of a person. We call
it five Fs, feeling,

631
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:05,210
feeding, fleeing,
fighting, and ***.

632
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:11,410
Now let's review the
cerebral hemisphere as

633
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:15,270
we have introduced
so far. We have our

634
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:21,350
central sulcus, we have
our lateral sulcus to

635
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:24,430
divide the cerebral
hemisphere into the

636
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:28,190
frontal lobe, parietal
lobe, temporal lobe.

637
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:31,750
And from this hypothetical
line between the

638
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:35,950
occipital notch and
the parietal occipital

639
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:40,470
gyrus, we have the
occipital lobe as well. So

640
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:43,550
these different
lobes is in charge of

641
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:46,550
different functions. As
you can see, the frontal

642
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:48,970
lobe, we talked about
the motor function,

643
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:52,510
as well as the social
behavior for the prefrontal

644
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:55,450
cortex, and Broca's
area for language.

645
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:58,870
And for the parietal
lobe, we have this

646
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:03,030
somatosensory
cortex. We also have

647
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:06,530
Wernicke's area that's
going across the

648
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:10,330
parietal lobe and
temporal lobe. And

649
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:12,910
also, we have the
auditory cortex right

650
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:16,310
here at the superior
temporal gyrus.

651
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:20,550
And at the medial
temporal lobe, we also

652
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:23,330
see half the limbic
structures that's related

653
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:27,410
to memory and emotions.
At the back occipital

654
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:30,410
lobe is mainly for
the visual cortex.

655
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:37,070
The pelvic lobe
buried inside the

656
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:40,070
brain right next to
the corpus callosum

657
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:42,250
and the diencephalon
in the middle

658
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:46,590
is related with
learning and higher

659
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:48,950
cognitive function
like emotions.

660
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:55,770
We went into the
details of introducing

661
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:58,890
the fall brain,
especially the cerebral

662
00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:01,590
hemisphere. here,
and we talked

663
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:03,630
about different
lobes at the cerebral

664
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:08,850
cortex, and also the
limbic structures.

665
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,310
Next, we're going
to talk about

666
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:13,310
the diencephalon,
brainstem,

667
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:15,350
cerebellum, and
basal ganglia.

668
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:23,130
Previously, we mentioned
that the diencephalon

669
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:25,830
including three
major structures. So

670
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:29,390
this is our diencephalon.
It has thalamus,

671
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:35,310
hypothalamus,
and pineal gland.

672
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:39,370
Although it
doesn't look very

673
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:41,610
big, diencephalon is very

674
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:43,730
important for the
brain functions.

675
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:47,310
So thalamus is a big
relay center for the

676
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:50,850
sensory information
to be transmitted from

677
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:54,610
the body to the
cerebral cortex. and the

678
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:56,770
hypothalamus is
super important for

679
00:39:56,770 --> 00:40:01,470
maintaining homeostasis
like controlling the

680
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:05,550
autonomic functions
and the pineal gland is

681
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:08,990
controlling the
circadian rhythms in our

682
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:12,730
body so you know we
got sleepy during the

683
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:16,250
night and be very
energetic during the day.

684
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:20,970
Now let's look
more closely to

685
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:22,990
the brainstem.
This is again a

686
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:25,290
mid-sagittal slice
of the brain.

687
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:29,690
As you can see, the
brainstem has the three

688
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:31,910
major structures.
This is the midbrain

689
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:35,290
with those two
bumps. You know,

690
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:37,610
those are the two
colliculi. Those

691
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:40,070
are the landmarks.
And then pons,

692
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:43,050
you have the spatial
pons, that's the big

693
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:47,790
belly. And then you
have medulla. So medulla

694
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:52,270
is the lower part of
the brainstem that's

695
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:56,330
connecting to the spinal
cord. So these three

696
00:40:56,330 --> 00:41:00,750
major structures are
very important with the

697
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:05,530
general functions of,
you know, vital to

698
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:08,330
the life, really
important for survival

699
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:11,990
controlling breathing
cardiovascular function

700
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:16,210
closely related to the
autonomic control we

701
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:19,490
talked about the
hypothalamus is the one of

702
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:22,330
the big centers controlling
autonomic output

703
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:27,370
and the hypothalamus
has to go along the

704
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:32,750
brain stem you know
pretty much dorsolateral

705
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:36,510
aspects of the
brainstem going along to

706
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:40,630
reach the spinal cord
to control you know

707
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:43,710
the sympathetic chain
and you know control

708
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:47,110
the parasympathetic
functions too so

709
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:49,930
the autonomic control
coming down from

710
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:52,670
the hypothalamus are
reaching the spinal

711
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:55,950
cord passing through
the entire brainstem

712
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:01,970
We're just going to
introduce briefly the

713
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:04,890
basal ganglion structures
here. You're going

714
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:07,490
to have a special
lecture later on to talk

715
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:12,250
about each individual
areas within the basal

716
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:15,470
ganglion, which is
actually distributed across

717
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:19,490
cerebrum, midbrain,
and diencephalon. so

718
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:22,530
all of these different
nuclei are working

719
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:28,190
concertedly so to
initiate the movement and

720
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:31,670
thoughts and also
related to the reward

721
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:36,850
sensation so after a long
time Parkinson's patients

722
00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:39,430
a lot of time to receive
like experiencing

723
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:42,530
the dementia, so they
have cognitive decline

724
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:45,900
and also a problem
with their emotions.

725
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:52,710
Greenstem is
also the home

726
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:55,510
for the 12
cranial nerves,

727
00:42:56,050 --> 00:42:58,930
actually besides
the first two, so

728
00:42:58,930 --> 00:43:01,370
it's a home for the
10 cranial nerves.

729
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:04,510
These cranial nerves
have been introduced

730
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:08,110
in great details by
Dr. Jason Burke. Please

731
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:10,450
review his lecture
if you don't remember

732
00:43:10,450 --> 00:43:13,150
these cranial nerves
and their functions.

733
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:18,710
And because it's a
brainstem connecting

734
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:21,750
the brain and the
spinal cord, you can

735
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:25,450
see the long tracks
of ascending, which

736
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:28,730
means from the body
to the brain, as well

737
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:31,230
as descending, which
means from the brain

738
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:35,210
out to the body
those long tracks all

739
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:38,910
passing the brain
stem so brain stem is

740
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:42,610
extremely important
for these long traps

741
00:43:45,610 --> 00:43:48,710
another important
function in the brain

742
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:52,870
stem is to maintain
consciousness we

743
00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:57,550
have this reticular
activating system within

744
00:43:57,550 --> 00:44:01,930
this entire brainstem
and so you know

745
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:05,250
it projects all
these signals the

746
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:07,850
neurotransmitters
throughout the entire brain

747
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:10,510
to control the level
of consciousness

748
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:14,450
so basically promoting
awareness of the

749
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:18,550
environment so a
brainstem lesion patient

750
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:22,110
usually have the
problem with the they

751
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:25,390
might be alive but
they are not really

752
00:44:25,390 --> 00:44:28,350
aware of the surroundings
so they can be at

753
00:44:28,350 --> 00:44:31,430
the vegetative state
or in a coma state

754
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:38,380
okay last part of
the brain cerebellum

755
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,090
cerebellum is meaning
small brain or little

756
00:44:42,090 --> 00:44:45,490
brain in Latin We know
that it's related to

757
00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:49,370
the motor coordination,
and if we try to

758
00:44:49,370 --> 00:44:53,430
learn how to ride a
bike or swim, we would

759
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:55,730
need the cerebellum
to function normally.

760
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:58,770
The reason it's
a small brain is

761
00:44:58,770 --> 00:45:01,210
because it also has
two hemispheres,

762
00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:04,450
kind of a mini-sized
brain, but it does not

763
00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:08,290
have the complexity of
the cerebrum. In recent

764
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:10,890
years, the cerebellum
has been studied a

765
00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:14,210
little more and was
discovered that it's

766
00:45:14,210 --> 00:45:18,290
related to the limited
sensory function as well

767
00:45:18,290 --> 00:45:22,050
as learning memory and
cognitive function.

768
00:45:22,270 --> 00:45:25,210
So cerebellum works
with the spinal cord

769
00:45:25,210 --> 00:45:27,950
to help control the
motor coordination.

770
00:45:31,550 --> 00:45:35,150
Okay, last but not
least, the spinal cord.

771
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:39,030
The spinal cord is
connecting with the

772
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:42,350
brainstem here is
a home for the long

773
00:45:42,350 --> 00:45:46,030
tracts. As you can see
how much white matter

774
00:45:46,030 --> 00:45:49,190
surrounding the gray
matter, you imagine

775
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:52,170
a lot of long tracts
are located here.

776
00:45:52,170 --> 00:45:55,690
So for the gray
matter, we can

777
00:45:55,690 --> 00:45:58,450
divide them into
the dorsal horn,

778
00:45:58,970 --> 00:46:03,890
a ventral horn, and
a lateral horn here

779
00:46:03,890 --> 00:46:07,410
at the thoracic
cord so the dorsal

780
00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:10,250
horn received
information from the body

781
00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:16,050
so from the you know
skin limbs wherever

782
00:46:16,050 --> 00:46:19,430
it can either send
the information up

783
00:46:19,730 --> 00:46:22,700
through the brain
stem to the brain or

784
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:26,870
send the information
locally within the

785
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:29,750
spinal segment and
then innervate the

786
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:33,090
ventral horn motor
neurons to contract

787
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:37,610
the muscle. So this
internal arc is

788
00:46:37,610 --> 00:46:41,370
called spinal
reflexes. So the spinal

789
00:46:41,370 --> 00:46:44,750
reflexes are very
useful for diagnosis.

790
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:49,310
Showing here in this
cartoon, the doctor

791
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:51,870
is using a small
hammer to hit this

792
00:46:51,870 --> 00:46:56,110
underneath the knee joint.
It's called patellar

793
00:46:56,110 --> 00:46:58,510
reflex. In the
normal person, the

794
00:46:58,510 --> 00:47:01,540
patellar reflex will
not be this exaggerated

795
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:04,790
to lift the leg and
the foot to kick

796
00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:08,850
the doctor's chin.
But when you have

797
00:47:08,850 --> 00:47:11,950
pathological conditions,
then there is a

798
00:47:11,950 --> 00:47:15,230
possibility there is a
hyperreflexia. So this

799
00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:17,890
deep tendon reflex
can be exaggerated.

800
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:20,750
And that's one of
the hallmarks of the

801
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:22,930
upper motor neuron
lesions. You're

802
00:47:22,930 --> 00:47:25,250
going to go through
those in the future.

803
00:47:27,530 --> 00:47:30,930
We mentioned about the
lateral horn in the

804
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:33,610
thoracic region.
This is where the

805
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:37,530
sympathetic preganglionic
neurons are located.

806
00:47:37,610 --> 00:47:41,430
So spinal cord is
an important release

807
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:43,890
station for the
autonomic nervous system.

808
00:47:44,090 --> 00:47:47,910
And from these
lateral horn neurons,

809
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:52,150
the cells can send
out the axons to the

810
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:55,190
periphery. And for
the parasympathetics,

811
00:47:55,190 --> 00:47:57,550
it's not only
located in the spinal

812
00:47:57,550 --> 00:47:59,750
cord, in the sacral
segment of the

813
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:02,090
spinal cord, but
also located in the

814
00:48:02,090 --> 00:48:05,490
brainstem. This is
part of the medulla.

815
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:12,270
All right, let's
review the second part

816
00:48:12,270 --> 00:48:16,710
of the lecture.
So the first part,

817
00:48:16,710 --> 00:48:19,930
we talked about the
cerebrum, and the

818
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:22,210
second part, we were
talking about the

819
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:25,050
diencephalon,
which including the

820
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:30,210
hypothalamus, thalamus,
and pineal gland.

821
00:48:30,370 --> 00:48:33,530
So thalamus is our
relay station mainly

822
00:48:33,530 --> 00:48:36,100
for the sensory
information, and

823
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:38,790
hypothalamus is for
the autonomic function

824
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:41,570
control and maintain
the homeostasis.

825
00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:45,730
Brainstem is for
the autonomic system

826
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:48,270
as well as the
cranial nerves, lung

827
00:48:48,270 --> 00:48:51,090
tracts, and also
important information

828
00:48:51,090 --> 00:48:53,870
about keeping the
person conscious,

829
00:48:54,450 --> 00:48:58,590
so the ascending
reticular formation.

830
00:48:59,110 --> 00:49:01,290
And then
cerebellum is for

831
00:49:01,290 --> 00:49:02,590
the motor coordination.

832
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:05,590
Spinal cord is for
these lung tracts

833
00:49:05,590 --> 00:49:08,690
receiving the body's
information and sending

834
00:49:08,690 --> 00:49:11,230
the signals to control
the body movement.

835
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:18,060
All right, let's
do the final

836
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:20,280
review of
today's lecture.

837
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:22,880
So you have to
understand the central

838
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,920
nervous system
is comprised of

839
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:28,040
brain and spinal
cord in general.

840
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:30,420
And then brain,
of course, can be

841
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:33,820
subdivided into different
parts, including

842
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:37,080
forebrain, cerebellum,
and brain stem.

843
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:40,300
And forebrain,
including the cerebral

844
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:43,580
hemisphere and
diencephalon. Brainstem

845
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:46,940
includes the midbrain,
pounds, and medulla.

846
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:50,720
And then for the
cerebral hemisphere

847
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:53,880
or cerebrum, you
could further

848
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:56,340
divide it into the
cerebral cortex,

849
00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:00,540
basal ganglion, and
the limbic structures.

850
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:03,240
For diencephalon,
you could also

851
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:05,540
further divide
them into thalamus,

852
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:07,580
hypothalamus,
and pineal gland.

853
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:10,560
the most complex
part is the cerebral

854
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:14,560
hemisphere which is
further divided into

855
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:18,120
the five different
lobes so the limbic

856
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:21,680
lobe is actually
kind of overlapping

857
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:25,060
here that with the
limbic structures

858
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:37,960
this is the end of
the lecture please

859
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:40,660
make sure you send
me some feedbacks if

860
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:42,760
you have comments or
suggestions to help

861
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:46,280
me improve before
i end this lecture

862
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:49,680
i'd like to emphasize
one more time please

863
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,840
read this book
notice essentials of

864
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:55,040
the human brain second
edition this is a

865
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:58,180
called essentials
