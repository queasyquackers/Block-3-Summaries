00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:01,550
Welcome students to the

2
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:03,830
Pharmacology
of Antibiotics.

3
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:06,230
This lecture is on
the folate synthesis

4
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:08,810
inhibitors, Dr.
Goldstein speaking.

5
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,150
The typical
learning objectives,

6
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,230
mechanisms,
mechanisms, mechanisms.

7
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:19,010
Here are links if
you prefer to learn

8
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:22,430
by reading review
books or text books,

9
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:25,630
you don't have to
use the video if

10
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:27,660
you don't want to,
it's not required.

11
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,930
what you need to know
and understand. So here

12
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:36,710
are key points no
matter what resource you

13
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:39,450
use for your new
learning. This is what

14
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:42,060
you're going to need to
know for this course.

15
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,120
And that brings us to
the folate synthesis

16
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,880
inhibitors beginning
of the lecture.

17
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,680
These sulfonamides are
structurally related

18
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,220
to this natural product,
paraamino benzoic

19
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:07,140
acid, which is a
precursor to folic acid.

20
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,600
You can see the
similarities

21
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,340
here, I believe,
with Paba.

22
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,460
Here is the sulfonamide,
which gives this

23
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:22,560
class of drugs its
name, the sulfonamides.

24
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:30,280
This structure is a
sulfone for dapsone.

25
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,260
I will not be
covering this drug in

26
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,980
this lecture.
You are likely to

27
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:39,340
see it in a future
lecture sometime,

28
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,060
and the properties
are generally pretty

29
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:46,580
close to the same
as the sulfonamides,

30
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:47,980
but the spectrum
of action is

31
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,340
different. That's all
I'll say about that.

32
00:01:51,080 --> 00:02:00,040
Now trimethoprim is
not asulfonamide. It's

33
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,640
not structurally related
to para-aminobenzoic

34
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,370
acid. It is an analog
of dihydrofolate,

35
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,660
which is the second,
approximately

36
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:15,980
second, step in the
folate synthesis pathway.

37
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:25,180
Folic acid folates,
activated folate, is

38
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:33,300
essential for the
synthesis of purines, DNA,

39
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:37,220
RNA, and proteins at
the end of the line.

40
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,040
Sulfonamides
and trimethoprim

41
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,580
are not used alone.

42
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:49,620
They are bacteriostatic.
There is a

43
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,740
great deal of
resistance against them.

44
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:54,760
They are generally
used together

45
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,540
in fixed
combination, so all

46
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:01,620
together in one
pill or one IV bag.

47
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,600
therefore we I will
be talking about

48
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,000
them together for
the most part.

49
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,880
Pyramethamine

50
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,220
is another
dihydrofolate reductase

51
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:20,720
inhibitor against
certain protozoa that

52
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,080
is used together
with the sulfonamide.

53
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,740
You should be aware
of this drug too.

54
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,450
Sulfonamides have
been around a long

55
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:35,330
long time. The first
one, sulfanilamide,

56
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:40,350
was marketed in
1935, and the

57
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,710
way the categorization
scheme was much

58
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,850
less sophisticated
than it is now.

59
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:48,330
They are divided
into agents that are

60
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:52,730
absorbed and excreted
rapidly, agents that

61
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,670
are poorly absorbed
when administered

62
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:57,070
******, and are
active in the bowel

63
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,170
lumen. Actually, there's
only one of them.

64
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:02,010
Agents that are
rapidly absorbed but

65
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:04,130
excreted slowly,
so they'd be long

66
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:07,690
-acting, and then
the topical agents.

67
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,650
This is a
generalization, I mean I

68
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:16,570
should say a big
overview. I put it

69
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:20,610
this way, so to
encourage you to

70
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:23,490
kind of get the
scheme, the pattern,

71
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:28,310
the general class
effects before you learn

72
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:31,170
about the individual
drugs, the individual

73
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:35,350
drug names. I have
bolded and put stars on

74
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:37,970
the drug names that you
need to know because

75
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:43,370
they are either in
broad use or they are

76
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:47,170
essential for treatment
of certain infections

77
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:52,250
or they are highly
relevant on board exams.

78
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:55,430
all of these in
fact might be highly

79
00:04:55,430 --> 00:05:00,230
relevant on a board
exam the bolded drugs

80
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:07,390
are all rapidly absorbed
except these two

81
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,670
which are just topical
you do need to know

82
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:12,970
the topicals and here
is trimethoprim the

83
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:16,530
non sulfonamide and
here is the combination

84
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:20,450
of sulfamethoxazole
and trimethoprim. So

85
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:25,010
it is called TMP-SMX
to use the letters.

86
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,950
Variable protein binding,
it depends on the

87
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:36,270
drug. They distribute
in body tissues and

88
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:38,330
fluids, so they get to
where they're going.

89
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:41,250
We see hepatic
metabolism,

90
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:45,210
CYP2C9, and also
anacetylation,

91
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:49,350
N-acetyltransferase
type 2.

92
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,470
trimethoprim we have our

93
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,110
CYP2C9 again
and also 3A4.

94
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:03,370
The excretion
is unchanged

95
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:05,330
through the kidney.

96
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:08,150
Same with trimethoprim.

97
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:12,610
Therefore as you could
expect because these

98
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:16,130
drugs are in high
concentrations in urine,

99
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:18,390
you might say to
yourself, gee, I wonder

100
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:21,070
if they're really
good for urinary tract

101
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:23,830
infections, which, by
the way, are caused

102
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:27,150
mainly by E. coli and
other gram negatives.

103
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:29,490
And the answer is yes.

104
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:34,150
A particular adverse
effect that can occur

105
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:38,210
because of
sulfonamide's structural

106
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:43,710
propensities is that
they tend to participate

107
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:47,630
precipitate in acidic
urine particularly the

108
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:51,230
older ones but it
includes sulfamethoxazole

109
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:56,410
which is widely used
here it is and when

110
00:06:56,410 --> 00:07:02,450
the drug precipitates
It forms crystals,

111
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:06,150
and those crystals can
cause crystal urea.

112
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:10,990
A couple of half-life

113
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:12,930
things I want
to point out.

114
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:17,690
Trimethoprim has a
half-life of, say, 10

115
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:20,850
hours, and
sulfamethoxazole has a half

116
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:23,470
-life of about 11 hours.
So it makes sense

117
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:26,230
that these two would
be put together,

118
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:29,110
that sulfamethoxazole
in particular,

119
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:34,470
because of its
similar half-life.

120
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,790
Anything else?

121
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:41,690
That's pretty much it.

122
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,860
Metabolism.

123
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:51,260
So, sulfonamides
have this particular

124
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:54,300
metabolic pathway
that involves an

125
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,760
acetyltransferase
type 2, which is

126
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:01,540
associated with
polymorphisms that

127
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:05,820
lead to rapid and
slow acetylators.

128
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:10,330
If we have a patient
who is a slow

129
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:12,620
acetylator, that's
going to slow

130
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:16,080
down this part
of the pathway,

131
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,180
which could shunt
drug towards

132
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,800
this part of the pathway.

133
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,360
Over here,

134
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:32,990
these oxidative
metabolites

135
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:39,240
are detoxified
by glutathione.

136
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:43,360
And if the patient
has reduced levels of

137
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,040
glutathione, that's
going to push towards

138
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:53,100
the toxic metabolites. So
increased concentrations

139
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:57,200
of toxic metabolites
in patients who

140
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,860
are poor metabolizers
and thinking about

141
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:03,960
the really poor
metabolizers or have low

142
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:08,080
glutathione levels as
occurs in high stress

143
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,860
disease situations
such as AIDS patients.

144
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:17,280
these toxic metabolites
can cause direct

145
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:21,960
cytotoxicity to the
skin causing rash to the

146
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:26,500
liver and certain other
organs so this would

147
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:31,240
be a hypersensitivity
reaction due to

148
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,900
direct toxicity and
an immune-related

149
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:41,060
hypersensitivity due to
the immune system attacking

150
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:47,070
haptans that form from
these metabolites.

151
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,800
And then the immune
system attacks it.

152
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,040
So these metabolites
that cause direct

153
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,240
toxicity are reactive
oxygen species.

154
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:01,480
See how that all works?

155
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,560
together

156
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,640
mechanism.

157
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,040
Looking at the
figure on the right

158
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,870
-hand side, we have
our sulfonamides

159
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:19,660
and sulfone that
act at this first

160
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:24,100
step at dihydroteroate
synthase.

161
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,280
Here's the name
right here.

162
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,580
blocking that step.

163
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:34,860
And we have our
dihydrofolate reductase

164
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,840
inhibitors acting
at this step.

165
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:42,520
So it's a one-two
punch on that folate

166
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,000
pathway, folate
synthesis pathway.

167
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:52,450
So what about
selectivity?

168
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:59,070
well mammals like
us human beings do

169
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:02,250
not synthesize folate
we don't synthesize

170
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,050
it from a precursor
paba we get it

171
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:09,050
from our diet so we
don't we're we're

172
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:11,010
not involved with
that step at all we

173
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:15,730
don't have dihydroteroate
synthase we do

174
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:19,430
have dihydrofolate
reductase However,

175
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:23,950
the trimethoprim and
the pyrimethamine

176
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,410
have much, much,
much, much greater

177
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:29,470
affinity for the
bacterial, or in the case

178
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:32,150
of pyrimethamine,
the protozoal

179
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,830
dihydrofolate reductase.
So at the typical

180
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:42,420
therapeutic levels,
the human dihydrofolate

181
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:45,310
reductase will
not be inhibited.

182
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:51,390
Spectrum of activity.

183
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:55,910
Aerobic, gram
-positive and gram

184
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:58,990
-negative. And this
gram-positive even

185
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:02,470
includes community
-acquired MRSA.

186
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:06,030
This is, of course, if
there's no resistance.

187
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:12,350
And then Pneumocystis
urovici is a yeast

188
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:16,730
infection that occurs
in people with a

189
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:19,430
suppressed immune system
like AIDS patients.

190
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:24,450
And then some protozoa
I mentioned before

191
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:32,210
will see toxoplasmosis
is a good example.

192
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:43,110
Well, acquired resistance,
plasmid transfer

193
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:47,170
or random mutation
under selection pressure

194
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:51,690
will decrease permeability
to the drug so

195
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:55,170
the drug does not get
into the organism or it

196
00:12:55,170 --> 00:13:00,130
gets pumped out,
increasing the production

197
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:02,830
of para-aminobenzoic
acid so it actually

198
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:07,630
outcompetes the drug at
dihydroteroate synthase,

199
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:15,410
and modification of
the enzyme targets.

200
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:21,990
These are organisms
that cause common

201
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:26,430
infections, and
don't you know, their

202
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:30,010
Their susceptibility
is really low now.

203
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:35,910
The drugs are still
effective against

204
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:39,450
certain uncomplicated
urinary tract

205
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:44,190
infections as long as
the E. coli, Klebsiella

206
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:47,030
that cause it are
still susceptible.

207
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:51,130
There is considerable
intrinsic resistance.

208
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:55,470
sometimes it's easier
just remember things

209
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:58,070
like that the
intrinsic rather than

210
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,690
remembering what it's
effective against

211
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:05,130
so anaerobes so good
only against aerobes

212
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:07,670
enterococci so
we've seen that over

213
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:10,730
and over pseudomonas
aeruginosa seen that

214
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:13,510
over and over it's
not effective against

215
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,090
spirochetes, so
it's not going to be

216
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:17,670
good against Lyme
disease or ********.

217
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:22,630
Mycoplasma, that causes
community-acquired

218
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:24,650
pneumonia. It
doesn't affect that.

219
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,910
Mycobacterium
tuberculosis

220
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,520
and other mycobacteriums.

221
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:37,590
And an interesting feature
is that sulfonamides

222
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:39,550
stimulate the
growth of rickettsia

223
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:44,030
rickettsia rickettsii
causes Rocky Mountain

224
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:48,090
spotted fever which can
be deadly we know that

225
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:51,050
doxycycline is first
line for that drug but

226
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:53,410
we don't want to make
a mistake and say

227
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:57,700
okay well we can
give so trimethoprim

228
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:01,370
sulfamethoxazole certainly
not absolutely not So,

229
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:07,490
speaking of
therapeutic uses,

230
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:13,390
the sulfamethoxazole
and trimethoprim

231
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:15,850
are wide use
against all of those

232
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:19,270
susceptible bacteria
mentioned previously.

233
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:27,110
Sulfadiazine and
pyrimethamine are for

234
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,710
toxoplasmosis, and
it is first line.

235
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:36,650
Remember, pyrimethamine
is a potent

236
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:40,270
dihydrofolate reductase
inhibitor, so that's

237
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:46,090
going to have some
effect, potentially, on

238
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:53,890
human levels of active
folate. So this drug

239
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:58,010
called Leucovorin is
recommended in addition

240
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:02,610
just to prevent
megaloblastic anemia.

241
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:09,590
Sulfidoxine with
pyrimethamine is malaria.

242
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:12,650
However, there is so
much resistance to this

243
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:15,210
that it's not used
for treatment anymore.

244
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:19,970
And sulfasalazine
will meet

245
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:22,270
this in a future lecture.

246
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:24,890
or two future lectures,

247
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:29,490
this is one that's
not well absorbed,

248
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:32,690
a little bit, but
not well absorbed.

249
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:39,390
So it acts in the gut
for inflammatory bowel

250
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:46,410
disease, and whatever
little bit of the

251
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:50,570
sulfa component that's
absorbed is effective

252
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:53,230
for the treatment of
rheumatoid arthritis.

253
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:55,630
The mechanism on that
is just not clear.

254
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:00,370
Topical,
sulfacetamide sodium

255
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:03,790
for eye infection.
It's also

256
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:06,050
available for
dermatologic use.

257
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:09,850
Silver sulfadiazine,
I put a star on.

258
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:11,770
This is for burns.

259
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:14,630
Silver is slowly
released and

260
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:17,030
it's toxic to the
bacteria. So, the

261
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:20,190
silver is an
active component.

262
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:25,670
Maffinide or
maffinide acetate is

263
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:28,810
also for burns and
it's effective.

264
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:32,230
However, it's readily
absorbed from the

265
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:36,710
burn area compared to
silver sulfadiazine,

266
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:38,610
which is not absorbed
through the skin.

267
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:41,590
Now, for small burn
areas, that's not

268
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:44,830
going to be a
problem. But for large

269
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:47,210
burn areas, if
it's used, it can

270
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:51,390
actually cause metabolic
acidosis because

271
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:58,770
it's a carbonic
anhydrase inhibitor.

272
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:05,570
Plus, it can
cause intense

273
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:07,810
pain when it's applied.

274
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:15,610
Adverse effects. I
mentioned before skin

275
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:19,450
reactions, and they
can be minor or severe.

276
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:22,390
But minor skin reactions
are very uncomfortable

277
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:24,530
for a patient and
very disturbing.

278
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:28,330
They can cause Stevens
-Johnson syndrome,

279
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:31,550
exfoliative dermatitis,
photosensitivity.

280
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:33,990
This is Stevens
-Johnson syndrome here.

281
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:37,130
Toxic epidermal
necrolysis.

282
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,910
They can cause
fever. That's a

283
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:44,050
sign of systemic
involvement.

284
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,110
Hepatitis, that's the

285
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:49,790
direct damage
to the liver.

286
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:54,990
Hematopoietic disturbances,
granulocytopenia,

287
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:57,570
aplastic anemia,
thrombocytopenia,

288
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:02,350
leukopenia. Again, by
damage to the blood cells.

289
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:05,570
They're rare, but
potentially fatal.

290
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:10,950
Important, important.
If a patient develops

291
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:14,670
a rash, the drug
should be removed

292
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:18,850
immediately, and the
patient should be told

293
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:21,730
to stop taking the
drug if a rash appears

294
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:23,810
and to call the
doctor, or if it's

295
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:27,710
severe, to go to the
emergency department.

296
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:38,250
Patients with glucose 6
-phosphate dehydrogenase

297
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:41,090
deficiency are at
risk for hemolytic

298
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:47,730
anemia with oxidative
drugs or oxidative

299
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:52,350
metabolites due to
reactive oxygen species.

300
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:56,290
Bone marrow suppression,

301
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:57,750
I mentioned that before.

302
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:00,830
Crystaluria, I mentioned.

303
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:05,150
Newborns. This
crinicteris

304
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:06,720
is a type of
encephalopathy.

305
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:16,320
Sulfonamides
displace bilirubin,

306
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,200
unconjugated bilirubin,
from albumin binding

307
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,300
sites. That
leads to elevated

308
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:26,980
levels of unconjugated
bilirubin, which

309
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:29,800
then passes through
the leaky blood

310
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:34,340
-brain barrier and
deposits in the CNS.

311
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,620
And that causes
the encephalopathy.

312
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:43,160
So newborn infants,
and really, it's

313
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:46,040
extended to less
than one month.

314
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:50,500
Pregnancy, the same
thing. Late pregnancy.

315
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:57,940
Plus, all
antibiotics, they can

316
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,800
cause C. difficile
infection.

317
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,460
This is a scheme that

318
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,800
I've presented before.

319
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:12,360
showing the mechanism
of G6PD deficiency

320
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:16,940
causing increased
glutathione,

321
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:20,920
sorry, decreased
glutathione reductase

322
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:25,000
and therefore
decreased glutathione

323
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:31,480
detoxifying
capabilities. Also,

324
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:41,800
NADPH is necessary
for conversion of

325
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,080
methemoglobin, which
doesn't carry oxygen,

326
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:48,720
to our oxygen
-carrying hemoglobin.

327
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:54,660
So increased levels
of methemoglobin

328
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:58,380
or methemoglobinemia
due to a

329
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:04,260
reduction in NADPH
due to glucose 6

330
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:08,200
-phosphate dehydrogenase
deficiency will

331
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,400
cause both of these
adverse effects.

332
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:16,580
and a picture of crystal
urea patient with

333
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:19,980
all sulfonamide crystals
that precipitated

334
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:24,620
in the urine i want
to point out here

335
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:27,380
this drug interaction
you see i put a star

336
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,590
on methenamine this
is an important drug

337
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:32,160
interaction methenamine
is something called

338
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,560
a urinary antiseptic
it is not a

339
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:38,620
sulfonamide. It is not
like trimesoprim. It's an

340
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:43,700
antiseptic. It's used
for prophylaxis of

341
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:46,860
urinary tract infections.
Methanamine turns

342
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:53,680
into formaldehyde
and ammonia in acidic

343
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:56,700
urine, And this
combination with a

344
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:03,780
sulfonamide can cause
precipitation and crystal

345
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:06,500
urea. I would like
you to remember this.

346
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:16,550
Here's a picture of
the one on the right is

347
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:20,170
a child who had
cronicteris as a newborn.

348
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:25,690
And the drawing on
the left, you can see

349
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:29,450
some signs of cronicteris
in this child.

350
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:36,470
elevated levels of
bilirubin deposit

351
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:37,990
in the skin and
that's how it

352
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:39,970
causes the yellowing
of the skin.

353
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:41,990
Now trimethoprim.

354
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:47,090
It's oral, well
-absorbed, widely

355
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:49,190
distributed in fluids
and tissues just

356
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:50,640
like we saw with
the sulfonamide,

357
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:53,710
sulfamethoxazone.
There's some hepatic

358
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:55,790
metabolism excreted
in the urine

359
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:58,210
as unchanged drug
and a half-life

360
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:00,170
of in the neighborhood
of 10 hours

361
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:02,230
if you want to
remember it that way.

362
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,870
So it's given
twice a day.

363
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:10,670
I'm sure you recognize
the similarity

364
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:12,330
in these pharmacokinetic

365
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:14,930
properties with
sulfamethoxazoles.

366
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:18,350
Mechanism of action
inhibits bacterial

367
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:21,470
dihydrofolate
reductase and therefore

368
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:24,530
interrupts the folate
synthesis pathway.

369
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:29,950
The monotherapy,
which is hardly ever

370
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:34,030
used, is for acute
uncomplicated urinary

371
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:36,790
infection if the
organism is still

372
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:41,030
susceptible and for
prophylaxis of UTI. You

373
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:43,340
might see it that
way more frequently.

374
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:47,270
It can cause
megaloblastic anemia,

375
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:50,370
which is decreased
folate levels,

376
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:58,610
and that leads
to anemia, and we

377
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:03,090
see the blood cell
adverse effects.

378
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:07,650
It's related to low
folate levels. Drug

379
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:09,970
can also cause
hyperkalemia, And that

380
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:11,670
should be watched
in people who are

381
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:15,670
receiving this in high
concentrations such

382
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:20,170
as IV in the hospital
or long-term use.

383
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,230
TMP, SMX, it's
used for a lot of

384
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:32,050
different things.
The aerobic gram,

385
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:37,610
negative infections,
and community

386
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:40,980
-acquired MRSA, it's
still susceptible.

387
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:48,470
The systems are
UTI, traveler

388
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:51,730
diarrhea and
gastroenteritis, so gut,

389
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:54,450
urinary tract, gut,

390
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:58,670
upper respiratory
tract, so acute otitis

391
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:03,490
media, and community
-acquired MRSA. So those

392
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:09,230
are the general baskets
of therapeutic uses.

393
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:10,670
Nocardia,

394
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:13,490
drug of first
choice. Neocardia is

395
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:16,870
a gram-positive
organism that can

396
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:19,270
cause some serious
infections,

397
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:22,270
especially in
immunocompromised people.

398
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:25,810
Here's listeria.
We do use

399
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:31,290
ampicillin together
with gentamicin.

400
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:33,930
So if for some
reason the patient

401
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:36,910
can't have that, then the

402
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:39,730
TMP-SMX might be
a good option.

403
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:42,950
Pneumocystis pneumonia.
So pneumocystis

404
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:47,010
urovici, it is the
drug of choice.

405
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:49,230
Whenever you see a
drug of choice, put

406
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:51,970
it under your hat
that that's something

407
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:54,210
that you need to
be remembering.

408
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:57,970
Toxoplasma gondii,

409
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:00,710
so that's the
sulfadiazine pyromesamine.

410
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:05,170
And I should put on here

411
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:09,070
also, under
some protozoa,

412
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:10,370
malaria.

413
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:19,670
which is paramethamine
and sulfidoxine.

414
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:29,890
So here are some
check-your-knowledge

415
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:32,670
questions just
running down

416
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:34,650
the line and
everything that's in

417
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:37,850
the learning
objectives. In fact,

418
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:41,190
the target, the
antibacterial

419
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:43,810
spectrum, the
resistance mechanisms,

420
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:47,050
what's intrinsically
resistant,

421
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:49,910
what is the spectrum,

422
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:54,410
that susceptible
organisms would respond.

423
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:58,450
Why do we combine
sulfonamides

424
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:01,530
with the trimethoprim?

425
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:02,710
One,

426
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:10,510
alone they are
bacteriostatic. Together

427
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:14,390
they are bactericidal
and synergistic.

428
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:16,990
I didn't mention
it before,

429
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:18,610
but it is on the slide.

430
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:23,650
What are the names
of sulfonamide

431
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:28,690
and the DHFR
inhibitor, so

432
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:31,650
sulfamethoxazole
and trimethoprim,

433
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:35,470
sulfadiazine and
pyrimethamine,

434
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:38,170
sulfadoxine and
pyrimethamine.

435
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:42,370
TMP-SMX is a drug
of choice for no

436
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:46,470
cardiosis and for
pneumocystis pneumonia.

437
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:50,370
What is the proposed
mechanism of rashes

438
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:53,230
caused by the sulfonamide
treatment? That's

439
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:58,410
related to the toxic
reactive oxygen species

440
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:02,130
that can cause direct
toxicity and also

441
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:04,510
the metabolites that
can form a haptin and

442
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:07,250
draw an immune response.
And this occurs

443
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:10,670
in people who are
poor metabolizers of N

444
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:15,490
-acetyltransferase,
type 2, and individuals

445
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:19,290
who do not have adequate
glutathione stores

446
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:24,070
to detoxify those
reactive oxygen species.

447
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:30,930
So that's the proposed
mechanism of rashes

448
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:34,850
and certain systemic
adverse effects that

449
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:37,290
are related to
hypersensitivity reactions.

450
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:47,350
the sulfonamides are
not recommended in in

451
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:50,370
fact they're contraindicated
in newborns and

452
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:52,190
young infants because
of the risk of

453
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:55,830
kernectoris because
young infants do not have

454
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:59,670
well they have immature
metabolic systems

455
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:03,530
immature blood brain
barrier what sulfonamides

456
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:05,650
are used topically
for burn treatment so

457
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:09,250
silver sulfodiazine and
mafenide and what are

458
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:12,690
two adverse effects
of mafenide acetate so

459
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:20,310
metabolic acidosis due
to carbonic anhydrase

460
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:25,410
inhibition and also
pain on application.

461
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:30,290
So in summary
this is pretty

462
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:32,090
much what we
just went through

463
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:38,810
and here are the answers.
I hope that you'll

464
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:42,010
try and answer the
questions without looking

465
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:44,940
at the answers. And
that concludes the

466
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:48,890
lecture on the folate
synthesis inhibitors.
