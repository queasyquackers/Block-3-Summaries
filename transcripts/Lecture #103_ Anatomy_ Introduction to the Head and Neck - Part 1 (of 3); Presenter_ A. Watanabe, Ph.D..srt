1
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:03,740
This is an FOM
lecture on the

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:04,980
introduction
to the head and

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,240
neck given by
Dr. Aki Watanabe.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,500
My job today is to
convince you that the

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,780
head and the neck that
supports it is a truly

6
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:17,680
special region. And
why is that? Well, if

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,540
you look across different
animals, so here

8
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:22,480
we have a dinosaur,
human, and a gorilla.

9
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,120
And when you
pay attention

10
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,880
to the post
cranial skeleton,

11
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,270
you can see that a lot
of the appendicular

12
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:31,840
and the axial
skeletons remain pretty

13
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,740
similar across the
different species. But when

14
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,440
you pay attention
to the head, this is

15
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,400
where you see remarkable
variation in form.

16
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,200
Perhaps more relevant
to what you're doing,

17
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,700
which is going
through med school and

18
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,140
becoming physicians,
is that the head is in

19
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,400
a primary way that you
establish communication

20
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,820
and a connection
with your patients.

21
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,860
So head and the
neck that supports

22
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,520
it is indeed a
special region.

23
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:03,200
so in today's lecture
it will be divided into

24
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,820
three parts so the
first part will cover

25
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,880
the head and neck
architecture or the lay of

26
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,440
the land of the head
and neck and then in

27
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,440
the second part we'll
cover the special senses

28
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,660
and organs that exist
only in the head

29
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,080
and the neck and then
we'll end this lecture

30
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,120
by covering the cranial
nerves and giving an

31
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,200
introductory overview
of these wonderfully

32
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,580
complex and multifunctional
set of nerves.

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,200
So before we move on
to the lecture content,

34
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,420
I wanted to go over
some of the basic

35
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,480
guidelines that my
lectures will follow.

36
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,840
So any red text on
slides means that

37
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,060
you need to know for
the exams. Similarly,

38
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,860
anatomical structures
that are labeled

39
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,880
in different figures
in red or in red

40
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,520
highlights are also
fair game for the exams.

41
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,440
and then make sure
to pay attention to

42
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,140
the clinical
correlates. These are

43
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,340
what you would call
high yield topics.

44
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,260
And then lastly, as
a general advice,

45
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,240
go over the
learning objectives

46
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,960
listed in the
course preparation

47
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,340
guide for these lectures.

48
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:08,260
So let's start with a
little review. So the

49
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:11,100
neck serves as a
conduit between the head

50
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,440
and basically the rest
of the body that we've

51
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,940
already covered. So
these include the

52
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,520
thorax, upper limb,
and the back. So it has

53
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,120
various structures that
go in and out, a lot

54
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,700
of them that you've
already covered. So here

55
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,480
you can pause the
video and think about

56
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,140
the different vessels,
nerves, and other

57
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,980
structures that go
through the head and neck.

58
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:41,430
Hopefully you were
able to identify some

59
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,130
of these important
structures. So let's start

60
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,150
with the nerves. So
we have the vagus

61
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,470
nerve and the brachial
plexus, which you

62
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,590
learned previously. And
then you also have the

63
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,830
vessels that you're
also fairly familiar

64
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:53,350
with at this point.
So you have the common

65
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:56,230
carotid artery and
internal jugular vein.

66
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,890
And then you
also have other

67
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:59,850
structures like the
cervical vertebrae

68
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:02,570
and esophagus
and the trachea.

69
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,060
So let's talk about
the skeletal system

70
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,340
in the head and
neck. So we have

71
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,740
the skull, which
is pretty obvious

72
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:15,060
structure, but please
keep in mind that

73
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:18,900
skull includes both
the cranium and

74
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,640
the mandible, which
forms a lower jaw.

75
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,580
And you also have
the hyoid, which

76
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,380
is a U-shaped
bone. It's a unique

77
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,620
structure where it's
a bone that doesn't

78
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,300
articulate or
connect with another

79
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,620
bone, and it aids
in swallowing.

80
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,280
You also have the
laryngeal cartilages,

81
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,140
which is a set of
cartilaginous tissues

82
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,360
that support the
voice box, which is

83
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,620
allowing me to talk
for this lecture.

84
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,480
focusing on the upper
part of the cervical

85
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,020
vertebral series you
have the atlas which

86
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:55,640
supports the skull
and the axis which

87
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:00,540
is the second cervical
vertebra or c2 and

88
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,560
so just to go over
some of the specific

89
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,680
structures on the
atlas or c1 there's the

90
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,840
superior articular
surface which is going

91
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,100
to connect with the
occipital condyles on

92
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,500
the underside of the
skull and the The

93
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,360
atlas will allow for
up and down motion. So

94
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,580
if you want to say yes
non-verbally to your

95
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:20,060
friends, then you
can thank the atlas.

96
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,640
And an axis has this
structure called a

97
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,280
dens, which means a
tooth. And this forms

98
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,300
a pivot that allows
the atlas to rotate.

99
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:32,420
So axis allows your
head to move in

100
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:36,860
sideways orientation.
So when you

101
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,840
want to say no to
things non-verbally,

102
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,000
you will be using
the axis. Yes.

103
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,180
Continuing on with the
skull. So the skull

104
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:49,520
looks like it's one
unit and functionally it

105
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:53,160
does serve as one unit,
but it's important

106
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,140
to know that it's
composed of 22 bones that

107
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:02,140
are fused together and
a couple or few middle

108
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:05,460
ear ossicles. So
ossicles mean tiny bones

109
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,700
and they sit in the
middle ear and they help

110
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:11,700
amplify the noise so
you can hear better.

111
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,920
And the skull is
split into two

112
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,660
different regions
or groupings. So

113
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,500
you have the
neurocranium, which

114
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,920
another word for it
is the brain case. And

115
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,880
as the name implies,
it houses the brain

116
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,440
and protects the
brain. And then you

117
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,180
have the visceral
cranium, which are

118
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:35,640
the bones that make
up the face and so

119
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,900
here are some of
the bones that you

120
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,320
need to know so you
have the frontal

121
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,700
which forms the kind of
the forehead parietal

122
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:49,300
bone temporal bone
zygomatic bone maxilla

123
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,800
and then you have
the mandible and

124
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:56,920
you can also try to
separate them and

125
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:00,100
this is called
exploded figure where

126
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,460
you can see sort
of the shape of

127
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,600
individual bones that
make up the skull.

128
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,880
So, so far, we've
just covered the adult

129
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,920
skull and the skeletal
system, but it's

130
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,300
important to know
that bones are living

131
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,200
tissue and that they
change throughout

132
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,840
development. So most
notably, in infants,

133
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:28,030
newborns, you have a
soft spot on the skull

134
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:30,890
called fontanelles. And
so these are fibrous,

135
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:37,120
soft tissues between
the cranial bones.

136
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,060
And so these sit in
between some of the

137
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,880
bones that we just
talked about. And these

138
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,620
fontanelles allow
movement among the

139
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,420
skull bones. And why
do you think that is?

140
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,000
Well, it has two
functions. So the first

141
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,700
function is that when
the baby is being born

142
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,120
and going through the
birth canal, it allows

143
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,300
the skull bones to
move around and even

144
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,980
go on top of each
other a little bit so

145
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:08,520
that the baby can be
born and the head can

146
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,600
fit through and go
through the birth canal.

147
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,400
The another reason
is these pontinelles

148
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,660
stay a little bit
longer after birth

149
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,740
to allow for the
growth of the brain.

150
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,930
And so there are
different types of

151
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:24,180
fontanelles. So here we
have labeled anterior

152
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,640
fontanelle, which sits
between the frontal

153
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,780
and parietal bones.
And this is the largest

154
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:31,120
fontanelle. And you
also have the lateral

155
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,320
fontanelles towards
the side of the

156
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,280
skull. And then you
also have the posterior

157
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,680
fontanelle between the
parietal and occipital

158
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,280
bones. So both the
lateral and the

159
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,760
posterior fontanelles,
they close up within

160
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,440
kind of few months of
the baby being born.

161
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:49,440
But then the anterior
fontanelle is going

162
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,580
to exist and remain
up until, you know,

163
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,780
year to year and a
half after birth.

164
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,500
So, you know, if
you're handling or, you

165
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,760
know, if you know a
baby and if you notice

166
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:06,120
a soft spot, as long
as it's, you know,

167
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,000
still there and the
baby is no older

168
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,140
than a year and a
half, there's nothing

169
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,940
to worry about. So
you can explain to the

170
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,800
parents that this is
totally normal. And

171
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,880
it's actually a good
thing that the baby

172
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,340
has these fontanelles
with soft spots.

173
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:25,720
And so I just alluded
to the fact that bone

174
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,440
is living tissue. And
then it's important

175
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,600
to know that there's
dynamism to the

176
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,380
scalpel system. So this
is no different with

177
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:38,160
the skull and
the mandible. So,

178
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:41,380
or sorry, the skull,
including the cranium

179
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:44,300
and the mandible.
and so on the left we

180
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:48,820
have an infant all the
way to a gerontic or

181
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:52,440
more senior individual
on the right and so

182
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,540
you have probably a
skull from a adolescent

183
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:00,840
individual and then
of course adult human

184
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,300
skull second from the
right so what you're

185
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:07,480
seeing here is that
the skull changes in

186
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,120
how it looks throughout
somebody's lifetime

187
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,340
so in the beginning
you tend to have these

188
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:16,140
rounded large orbits
or the eye socket

189
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:19,140
you also see this
anterior fontanelle here

190
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:23,500
and you obviously
start with no teeth and

191
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,500
then as you grow you
obviously gain more

192
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,620
teeth and the skull
becomes taller and then

193
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:35,080
after you know later
in adulthood or in in

194
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,620
more senior individuals,
the skull again

195
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,520
becomes more rounded
or globular, and you

196
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,630
also lose teeth. So
it's kind of poetic in

197
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:47,800
a sense that the older
individual tends to

198
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,980
start resembling an
infant later in life.

199
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:55,820
All right, now let's
move on from the

200
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,640
skeletal system and
talk about the nervous

201
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,360
system. So the
first thing I will

202
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,280
say is that the
brain anatomy will be

203
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,890
covered in detail
next semester in

204
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:06,940
neuroanatomy. So there's
not actually a lot

205
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,200
you need to know for
the nervous system.

206
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,650
One thing that I would
like to point out

207
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:13,760
is that the menisual
layers that you

208
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,360
learned previously,
so these are the dura

209
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,180
arachnoid and the pia
mater that you learned

210
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:22,220
that surrounds the
spine, spinal cord,

211
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,640
continues on into
the brain. And so you

212
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,780
still have the same
spaces. For example,

213
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:29,760
the subarachnoid
space contains a

214
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,760
cerebral spinal fluid.
And that's the same

215
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,040
thing that's happening
around the brain as

216
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,200
well. These are
continuous structures.

217
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,500
And in the brain, you
have other structures,

218
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,800
for example, the
choroid plexus that

219
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,860
generates and
produces the cerebral

220
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,580
spinal fluid. And then
you have these ventricles

221
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:49,180
and there's a set
of four of them

222
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:52,980
that are cavities where
the cerebral spinal

223
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,660
fluid flows through
within the brain.

224
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,300
Now let's move on
to talking about

225
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,380
ingestion and
respiration and structure

226
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,360
that are related
to these functions.

227
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,520
So in the head,
you have the GI

228
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,040
and respiratory
systems that are

229
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,300
connected through
the pharynx.

230
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,380
And first, you
have the nasal

231
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:20,660
cavity inside of
your nose, and

232
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,200
you also have
the oral cavity.

233
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:25,580
And these are separated
by the hard palate

234
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:28,750
and the soft palate,
so the fleshy

235
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:32,090
extension of the heart
palate posteriorly.

236
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:37,220
So what I want
you to do is

237
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,740
breathe in deeply
through your nose

238
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,740
and let's follow
the pathway of the

239
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:47,680
air. So the air,
when you do that, is

240
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,960
going to go through
the external

241
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:53,460
nonaris and then enter
the nasal cavity.

242
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,700
And then when
it passes the

243
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:59,520
internal nares,
then it has entered

244
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,740
a part called
nasopharynx.

245
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:07,280
And nasopharynx
ends at the uvula,

246
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,560
at the tip of
the soft palate.

247
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,350
And then beyond that
is the oropharynx,

248
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:14,900
which is posterior
to the oral cavity.

249
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,500
And then past the
epiglottis, this little

250
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,980
cover for the larynx
and the trachea, so

251
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,120
the food doesn't get
going through there,

252
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:28,080
that's a region called
a laryngopharynx.

253
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,380
So that's where it
starts up until the

254
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:34,040
esophagus or the
larynx. So the pharynx

255
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,360
is divided into three
parts, and these

256
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,220
are the boundaries
of those three parts.

257
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,420
So what we're going
to do is we talked

258
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,140
about how the air
moves from the

259
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:49,220
nasal cavity into
the trachea, but

260
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,920
let's just review
that pathway once

261
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,400
again. So breathe
through your nose.

262
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,440
And what's happening
with the air is it's

263
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,800
going to go through the
nasal cavity, and then

264
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,880
enter the nasopharynx,
the first part of

265
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,900
the pharynx, and then
go to the oropharynx

266
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:08,440
and laryngopharynx.
And then it's going to

267
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,100
air is going to mostly
go into the trachea,

268
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,060
right through the larynx
and into the lungs.

269
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,380
And the reverse path of

270
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,540
that is when
you exhale air.

271
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:22,300
On the other hand,
when you have food, you

272
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,580
will go through hopefully
the oral cavity.

273
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,880
I hope you don't
ingest food through

274
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,340
the nasal cavity. So
go through the oral

275
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:34,560
cavity and when it
passes the uvula, you've

276
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,400
entered the oral
pharynx and then

277
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,320
laryngopharynx. And of
course, you don't want

278
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,900
food going into your
larynx and trachea.

279
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,740
So it's going to
bypass past that and go

280
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,660
into the esophagus
and into the stomach.

281
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:52,930
So now we're going
to talk about

282
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:54,550
the mechanics
of ingestion,

283
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,350
which is a very
elegant system.

284
00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:01,550
So first, what
happens is when you're

285
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:04,270
processing the food,
you've ingested

286
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:05,950
it and it's in
the oral cavity.

287
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:09,610
The first phase of
ingestion is called

288
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:12,350
the oral phase. And
this is where the

289
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:14,930
depression or sorry,
the elevation of the

290
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:19,830
tongue is going to
push the bolus of the

291
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:22,850
food posteriorly
towards the pharynx.

292
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:27,970
And then the next
section or phase two

293
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:30,870
is called the pharyngeal
phase. And this

294
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,920
is where the soft
palate and the uvula

295
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,050
elevates to close up
the pathway between

296
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:40,070
the oropharynx and
the nasopharynx.

297
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:42,390
And so what this
does is it prevents

298
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:46,210
the food from entering
the nasal cavity.

299
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:50,190
And the third stage is
called the esophageal

300
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,830
phase. And this
is where the food

301
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:55,290
that's already in
the oropharynx gets

302
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:57,810
pushed down through
sequential contraction

303
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:59,910
of pharyngeal
constrictor muscles, and

304
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:02,010
then keeps on going
through palestalsis

305
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:04,670
through the esophagus
into the stomach.

306
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:08,290
And so the important
step here, well, all

307
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:09,990
three are important,
but something to know

308
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:12,570
about the second phase
or the pharyngeal

309
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:16,460
phase is that the soft
palate and the uvula

310
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,400
closes that pathway
into the nasal

311
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:22,370
cavity. So what I want
you to do is, oh, and

312
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:23,990
the other thing that
happens, excuse me,

313
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:27,890
is that the epiglottis
is going to come down

314
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:30,870
to block that pathway
between the oral,

315
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:34,330
sorry, the laryngopharynx
into the larynx.

316
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:36,170
So the food doesn't get
through there. So the

317
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:38,510
important consequence
of these things

318
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:42,950
happening in phase two
is that you can't breathe

319
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:45,270
and swallow at the same
time. So what I want

320
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:49,230
you to do now is try
to swallow either the

321
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:51,430
food that you might
have in front of you or

322
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:55,950
your spit works as
well, and try to breathe

323
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:58,090
at the same time. And
hopefully you find that

324
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,520
you can't do those
things simultaneously.

325
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:08,190
But an infant has a
superpower because

326
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:10,730
what they have
to do is suckle

327
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:13,330
and drink a lot
of milk and this

328
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:15,930
could take tens of
seconds to minutes

329
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:19,110
and during that
time obviously the

330
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:21,170
baby needs to breathe.
So how do babies

331
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:23,670
do that? Well what
happens in babies

332
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:26,450
is that the larynx
and the epiglottis

333
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:30,750
sit more superiorly
than in adults.

334
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:35,010
And what happens when
a baby's suckling is

335
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:39,390
that these two
structures, or excuse me,

336
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:41,350
the epiglottis and
the soft palate or the

337
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:44,910
uvula as well, interlock
in the middle of

338
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:49,590
the oral cavity. And
what this allows is

339
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:55,450
that it prevents the
milk from going into

340
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:58,750
the nasal cavity, but
rather the fluid or

341
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:03,930
the milk is going to
pass laterally and

342
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:10,670
bypass the pathway
into the larynx and the

343
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:14,130
trachea. So it goes
around that hole and

344
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:18,450
then flows posteriorly
into the esophagus.

345
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:21,170
So it's an elegant
kind of solution

346
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:23,490
to allowing
babies to breathe

347
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:25,550
and suckle at
the same time.

348
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:30,750
Okay, and let's also talk

349
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,490
about paranasal sinuses.

350
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:36,230
And so there are four
sets of paranasal

351
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:38,410
sinuses. They're paired,
which means they're

352
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:41,690
on both sides of
the head. And all

353
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:45,290
these paranasal sinuses
are named after the

354
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:47,130
bones that they sit
in. So for example,

355
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:49,290
the frontal sinus,
which is located sort

356
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:51,490
of in the middle,
just above your eyes,

357
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:55,990
that sits inside of
the frontal bone,

358
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:58,390
and ethmoid sinus
sits in the ethmoid

359
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:00,270
bone, sphenoid
sinus, that sits more

360
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:02,710
posteriorly, sits
inside of the sphenoid

361
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:05,350
bone, and maxidur
sinus, which is

362
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,350
going to be inside
the maxilla bone.

363
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:10,830
and all these sinuses
are connected to

364
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:14,110
the nasal cavity via
an opening the fram

365
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:17,130
not called osteo
and so the there are

366
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:19,590
multiple roles for
peranasal sinuses so

367
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:22,090
first not so much
the case in humans or

368
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:24,250
that it doesn't really
matter but they it

369
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,990
lightens the skull
weight a little bit

370
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:29,890
and it also allows for
the inhaled air to be

371
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:33,290
more humidified and
heated and then also

372
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:35,730
increases the resonance
for hearing. And this

373
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:40,410
is a reason why your
voice sounds differently

374
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,830
when you're talking
and hearing versus

375
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,950
when you're hearing a
recording of yourself.

376
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:49,410
And the clinical
relevance of paranasal

377
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:51,930
sinuses, and you
would have experienced

378
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,590
this if you'd gotten
a common cold, for

379
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:56,590
example, is that these
small openings that

380
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:59,290
connect these paranasal
sinuses to the

381
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:02,650
nasal cavity often
gets clogged up, either

382
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:06,350
through inflammation
or swelling of the

383
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:10,310
nasal lining and from
a virus. So what this

384
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:14,010
does is it prevents
the sinuses to be

385
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:18,830
drained. So the sinuses
increase in pressure,

386
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:21,590
and that tends to
lead to discomfort

387
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:23,810
or facial pain. And
that's what you're

388
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:28,550
feeling often when
you get a common cold.

389
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:34,870
Now, let's talk
about the vascular

390
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:36,750
system, and we'll start
with the arteries.

391
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:40,450
So, in the neck,
we start off with a

392
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:42,410
common carotid,
which comes from the

393
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:43,910
brachiocephalic trunk
on the right side of

394
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:46,810
the body and the
aortic arch on the left

395
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,920
side of the body,
and that splits,

396
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,110
while it's passing
through the neck, into

397
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:53,670
external carotid and
internal carotid.

398
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:56,250
And as their name
implies, the external

399
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,310
carotid supplies
predominantly

400
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:00,570
structures that are
outside of the skull.

401
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:02,930
And internal carotid,
on the other hand,

402
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:06,430
supplies structures
inside of the skull.

403
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:08,730
And so that
includes the brain.

404
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:11,490
And a couple important
structures to

405
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:14,550
take note. And this
happens where the common

406
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:17,190
carotid artery splits
into the external

407
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:19,710
internal carotid
arteries. And so

408
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:21,390
one of those structures
is called the

409
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:25,310
carotid sinus. And
that's a slightly dilated

410
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:27,790
portion that's
close to this split.

411
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:32,320
And there are nerves
coming from the

412
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,470
glossopharyngeal
nerve or cranial nerve

413
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:39,070
nine around this
carotid sinus, and

414
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:41,990
that is sensitive
to the stretching.

415
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:46,810
And this allows the
carotid sinus to be

416
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:48,210
a structure that's
responsible for

417
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:50,290
monitoring blood
pressure. So when it's

418
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,510
stimulated, meaning that
when it's stretched,

419
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:54,830
that means that the
blood pressure is

420
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:58,370
high. So what it does
is it leads to slowing

421
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:00,030
of the heart rate
once the stretching

422
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:03,310
is detected, leading
to vasodilation and

423
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:05,710
eventually decrease
in blood pressure.

424
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:09,590
Another important sensory
system that exists

425
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:12,210
in this part of the
body is the carotid

426
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:19,590
body, which is a cluster
of cells, specialized

427
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:22,770
cells that are
sensitive to the level

428
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:25,330
of oxygen and carbon
dioxide in the blood.

429
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:28,510
And this is
also innervated

430
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,290
by the
glossopharyngeal nerve.

431
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:38,210
So in the last parts
of this part of the

432
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:41,350
lecture on the head
and neck anatomy or the

433
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:43,870
architecture, we're
going to cover three

434
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:46,910
important danger zones
of the head and neck.

435
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:49,470
And so the first one
is called a terion,

436
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:53,090
a junction of the frontal
bone, the parietal

437
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:55,230
bone, the temporal
bone, and the bone

438
00:21:55,230 --> 00:22:02,270
and this region is
particularly thin so in

439
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:04,690
terms of skull thickness
and what's more

440
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,710
important is that there's
an important artery

441
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:08,710
called the middle
veninial artery which

442
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:11,010
unfortunately isn't
figured in this

443
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:14,270
illustration but it sits
right underneath the

444
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:16,530
skull or the internal
surface of the skull.

445
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:22,370
So if you are hit with,
for example, a blunt

446
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:26,610
instrument to the side,
that might fracture

447
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:30,150
these thin bones, and
it could lead to the

448
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:32,650
rupturing of this
middle meningeal artery,

449
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:36,010
and you can have
hemorrhaging inside

450
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:38,670
the skull. And so
this will lead to

451
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:40,270
compression of the
brain tissue. And

452
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:42,050
obviously this can
be life threatening.

453
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:47,250
So this is a good way
or a good point to

454
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:49,410
cover different types
of what's called

455
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:52,610
intracranial hemorrhage
or hematoma. So this

456
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:57,850
is obviously a very
serious situation

457
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:01,130
where you have blood
accumulation, internal

458
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,370
bleeding in the
endocranial or the brain

459
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:08,190
cavity. And so this
leads to obviously loss

460
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:10,190
of blood supply in
some parts of the

461
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:12,290
intracranial structures
like the brain, but

462
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:14,970
also it introduces
compression for the

463
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:18,090
brain, which is also
very life-threatening.

464
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:21,690
So the three different
types of intracranial

465
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:23,790
hematomas that I'd
like you to know

466
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:27,290
include epidural
hematoma, which occurs

467
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:29,150
between the skull
and the dura mater.

468
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:31,530
The second type
is subdural

469
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:34,670
hematoma. So
this is where the

470
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:38,390
bleeding or internal
bleeding happens

471
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:40,630
between the dura mater
and the arachnoid.

472
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:43,310
And this happens
when there's

473
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:45,030
a rupture in the
bridging veins

474
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:47,570
as well as the
sagittal sinus

475
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:51,870
right here between
the two hemispheres of

476
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:54,530
the brain. And you
also have subarachnoid

477
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:57,190
hemorrhage between the
arachnoid mater and the

478
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:59,650
pia mater. And so this
is very common when

479
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:01,530
you have a cerebral
arteries rupture and

480
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:06,170
this is obviously more
internal right here.

481
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:12,070
Now let's move
on to veins.

482
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:15,030
And just like arteries
and the carotid arteries,

483
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:16,790
you have external
jugular and internal

484
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:19,890
jugular and they work
mostly in similar ways

485
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:22,490
where external jugular
is gonna drain the

486
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:27,030
blood from the temporal
and occipital regions

487
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:30,050
outside of the skull
and internal jugular

488
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:32,950
vein drains the face,
but also structures that

489
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:35,130
are inside the skull,
including the brain.

490
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:40,610
And there's a very
special structure

491
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:45,550
called the cavernous
sinus inside of the

492
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:48,570
brain cavity. And so
this sits right next

493
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:51,250
to the pituitary
fossa or the pituitary

494
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:56,930
gland and this is a
structure where the

495
00:24:57,070 --> 00:25:04,350
venous sinus covers
or is outside of an

496
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:09,270
artery and very important
nerves. In other

497
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:11,990
words, We have the
internal carotid

498
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:17,030
artery, a branch of it
here, and you have a

499
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:20,530
set of five cranial
nerves or four if

500
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:22,490
you just count cranial
nerve five as one

501
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:24,850
of them. But these
are the two divisions.

502
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:26,790
You have cranial
nerves that are

503
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:30,250
bathing in deoxygenated
blood, which is

504
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:34,050
a very unique
configuration that's

505
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:36,550
only happening in
the cavernous sinus.

506
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:39,250
So you have, well,
what's inside

507
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:40,750
the cavernous
sinus? Let's go over

508
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,790
one by one. So
you have a branch

509
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:44,250
of the internal
carotid artery.

510
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:46,450
You also have
cranial nerve

511
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:48,330
three or ocular
motor nerve,

512
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:50,050
trochlear nerve,

513
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:52,330
deucin's nerve, and
these three cranial

514
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:53,990
nerves, which we will
cover a little bit

515
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:56,790
later, are responsible
for eye movement.

516
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:59,470
And then you also
have two divisions of

517
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:02,450
the fifth cranial
nerve, the trigeminal

518
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:04,730
nerve. So that includes
ophthalmic division

519
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,770
and the maxillary
divisions of cranial

520
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:10,410
nerve five that are
also to the side.

521
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:14,570
So there are important
nerves and arterial

522
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:16,450
structures that sit
within the cavernous

523
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:18,950
sinus. Well, what's the
clinical significance

524
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:22,990
of that? Well, we
have facial vein,

525
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:27,990
which drains blood
from the face of an

526
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:31,650
individual, and these
veins are valveless.

527
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:36,310
So depending on the
internal pressure within

528
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:38,930
these venous structures,
blood may actually

529
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:42,670
flow backwards through
the superior and

530
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:45,550
inferior ophthalmic
veins. So these are the

531
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:48,790
veins that are located
on the superior part

532
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:51,430
and inferior part of
the orbit or the eye

533
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:55,190
socket. And if there's
backflow of blood, these

534
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:57,370
would directly lead
into the cavernous

535
00:26:57,370 --> 00:27:00,290
sinus, which we just
talked about. So this means

536
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:02,790
that infections
around the nose, for

537
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:05,390
example, if you have
pimples or boils around the

538
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,790
nose, this can easily
spread into the

539
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:10,490
cavernous sinus. And we
just talked about the

540
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:12,890
important structures
that are located there,

541
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:18,070
including the pterotary
and the branch of

542
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:21,270
the internal carotid
and the cranial nerves.

543
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:25,810
so this triangle
area around the

544
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,750
nose is our
second danger zone

545
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:34,190
and now we're going to
finish off by talking

546
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:36,730
about the third and
the last danger zone

547
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:39,110
but before we do i
need to introduce the

548
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:41,990
structures that are
relevant so we're

549
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:44,210
going to go back to
talking about the neck

550
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:48,030
and in the neck we
have a series of fascia

551
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:52,570
and so we have investing
fascia which goes

552
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:56,950
around almost the
perimeter of the neck.

553
00:27:57,030 --> 00:28:00,050
And these fascia
collectively form

554
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:01,190
different
compartments, just

555
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:03,090
like in the upper
and lower limbs.

556
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:06,450
And so again, we went
over the investing

557
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:08,270
fascia, which are
the most superficial.

558
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:11,090
And then we have the
pre-tracheal fascia,

559
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:14,570
which surrounds the
thyroid gland here,

560
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:18,770
the trachea and the
esophagus. So it forms

561
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:20,850
a compartment that
includes these structures.

562
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:24,340
We also have the
carotid sheath, which

563
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:28,090
surrounds the internal
carotid and the

564
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:31,550
common carotid and the
external carotid. And

565
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:33,290
then you also have
the internal jugular.

566
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:36,950
And they're on the
both sides of the neck.

567
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:39,870
And you also have
the prevertebral

568
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:41,790
fascia, which
surrounds the

569
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:44,690
vertebrae and the
surrounding muscles.

570
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,190
And finally, we
have what's called

571
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:49,870
the alar fascia,
which connects the

572
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:53,230
two carotid sheets
on both sides.

573
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:57,950
So the third and the
last danger zone is

574
00:28:57,950 --> 00:29:01,150
this potential space
between the alar fascia

575
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:05,670
and the prevertebral
fascia. And the reason

576
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:08,230
why it's a danger
zone is because if

577
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:11,790
infection occurs in
this space, then there's

578
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:16,750
an easy route from near
the head region all

579
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:20,600
the way down through
the neck, through the

580
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:25,570
thorax and the
mediastinum, and down all

581
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:28,670
the way down to the
diaphragm. So it's an

582
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:31,510
easy sort of highway for
infections to spread.

583
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:35,550
And so this is danger
space for zone number

584
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:38,310
three. And this is
the space between the

585
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:40,750
alar fascia and the
prevertebral fascia.

586
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,610
All right. So now that
we covered the lay

587
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:47,790
of the land in the
head and the neck,

588
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:50,350
here's an example question
that will showcase

589
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:54,090
what an exam question
would look like.

590
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:57,550
So a 30-year-old
patient is admitted to a

591
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:59,430
hospital with a
traumatic injury to the

592
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:02,710
head. CT scan reveals
that the left middle

593
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:04,810
meningeal artery
between the skull and

594
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:08,030
the dura mater has
ruptured. So which type

595
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:10,150
of intracranial
hematoma or hemorrhage

596
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:13,310
describes this injury?
So we have a cross

597
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:17,030
-section from a CT
scan, and then we have

598
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:20,110
this illustration from
one of the previous

599
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,570
slides that show the
different types of

600
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:26,090
intracranial hemorrhage
slash hematoma.

601
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:30,130
so i will give
you about 15

602
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:33,030
seconds to think
of the answer okay

603
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:54,560
so the important
information here is that

604
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:57,540
the middle meningeal
artery sits between

605
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:59,980
the skull and the
dura model and we

606
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:02,300
learned this is relevant
to the first danger

607
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:05,020
zone the terion which
is to the side of

608
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:07,520
the skull this is
this particularly thin

609
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:11,950
part of the skull and
so because the rupture

610
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:15,380
happened on the artery
that sits between

611
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:17,980
the skull and the
dura mater it's going

612
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:21,560
to be in that epidural
space over here

613
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:27,320
so the answer is e
epidural hematoma
