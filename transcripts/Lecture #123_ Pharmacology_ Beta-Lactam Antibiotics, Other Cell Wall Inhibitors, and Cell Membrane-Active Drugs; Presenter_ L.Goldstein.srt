1
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:05,350
Welcome, students,
to the second part of

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:08,150
our pharmacology of
antibiotics, the beta

3
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:12,030
-lactams, other cell wall
inhibitors, and we'll

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,270
talk about one-cell
membrane inhibitor.

5
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:16,430
Dr. Goldstein speaking.

6
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:19,290
The drugs we'll
talk about are

7
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:21,810
the cephalosporins,
carbapenems,

8
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,780
there is one monobactam,

9
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:26,850
vancomycin,
and daptomycin.

10
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:31,750
Please contact me
if you or your study

11
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,950
group would like
to sit with me and

12
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:36,770
have a pharmacology
chat. Of course,

13
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,490
we can do this in
person or by Zoom.

14
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:44,690
The learning
objectives are

15
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:47,370
the same as for
part one because

16
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,060
this really is
one lecture.

17
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:53,830
Learning objectives
are not meant to

18
00:00:53,830 --> 00:01:01,170
be taken as discrete
learning issues.

19
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,430
Everything is
interrelated.

20
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,530
You need to be able to
look at the learning

21
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:08,170
objectives and think
about them as a whole.

22
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,770
Mechanisms, mechanisms,

23
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:11,930
mechanisms, and
patient safety.

24
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:19,230
Preparation materials
are as for part one

25
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:24,350
and I put lots of
information in part

26
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,710
one, the key points
that you need to know.

27
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:30,820
So let's start talking
about the cephalosporins.

28
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:33,490
The figure here
on the left hand

29
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:38,310
upper side shows our
beta-lactam ring that

30
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,810
you're all familiar
with now and this

31
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,010
ring is a little different
than the penicillin

32
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:46,360
so it gives them
different activities

33
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:52,270
the cephalosporins
have been developed

34
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:57,950
over decades the
drug that was first

35
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:04,910
was was became first
generation as drugs

36
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:07,910
developed later and
later and later and later

37
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:11,270
became second generation,
third generation,

38
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:14,450
fourth generation,
and the most recently

39
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:17,190
developed ones don't
really fit very well

40
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:21,010
into the previous
categories, so they've

41
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:23,170
been called by various
names. I'll just call

42
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:26,710
them advanced generation
cephalosporins.

43
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:30,410
This is the largest
group of beta-lactam

44
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:34,610
antibiotics. I have
selected some from

45
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:37,830
one or some from
each category. This

46
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:40,750
is certainly not all
of the cephalosporins

47
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,030
that have been
developed, but they're

48
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,550
the ones that are
most used and they

49
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:48,970
have important
pharmacologic features.

50
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:53,210
I will also be
showing you spectrums

51
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:55,630
of activity, the
same way I did before

52
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:59,470
with the penicillins
group, where we

53
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:03,230
have the list and we
block out features

54
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:06,330
where the drugs
are not effective.

55
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:09,090
So first generation,
cefazolin.

56
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,610
This is parenterol.

57
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,550
This is all later.
You don't have to

58
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,810
write this down.
And cefalexin, which

59
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:20,730
is oral. So
basically, we have our

60
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:25,210
choice of injection
or oral therapy.

61
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:28,330
Second generation,
and second

62
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:31,090
generation has
a subgroup. I'll

63
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:32,710
get into this
in more detail.

64
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:35,870
Third generation,
very important, very,

65
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:43,910
very important
group, widely used.

66
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:49,550
and that there's
one subgroup in this

67
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:54,270
category fourth generation
there's only one

68
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:58,310
drug in the category
this is a quite a broad

69
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:03,670
-spectrum drug and
then our advanced

70
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:06,690
generation I'll get into
that more later when

71
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:10,970
I when you see a
star on a drug. That

72
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:15,330
means that, of course,
as with all pharmacology

73
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:17,890
lectures, you need
to know the main

74
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:24,070
concepts, the class
effects, and then I will

75
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:27,190
give you certain
drugs to know by name.

76
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,750
Make them your friends.

77
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:34,170
When you are in
your clinical

78
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,090
rotations you'll
need to be able

79
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,650
to call drugs
by their names.

80
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:41,910
Now it's a little
difficult here because

81
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:44,370
cephalosporins all
start with Ceph. Well

82
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:45,870
the good thing is
you know it's a

83
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:48,830
cephalosporin. The bad
thing is it's kind of

84
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,510
hard to keep these
drug names straight.

85
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:54,570
Some students have
told me they make

86
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:56,890
mnemonics out of the
last part of the drug,

87
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:59,930
the part after Ceph,
and that helps them

88
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:04,010
to remember the drugs.
I don't have a good

89
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:06,990
mnemonic for you.
I suggest maybe AI

90
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:10,290
can help you with that
and many of you are

91
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:12,450
very clever with it
and can come up with

92
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:15,730
your own mnemonics
which I strongly

93
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:18,130
encourage you to share
with your classmates.

94
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:25,990
Class pharmacokinetic
properties and nearly

95
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:28,810
all All of these
drugs fall into this

96
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:33,850
general category, either
IM or IV, and oral.

97
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:36,930
They distribute to
most body fluids and

98
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:40,150
tissues, so widely
distributed, to

99
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:42,130
the bile and gallbladder,
the liver and

100
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,670
kidneys, the bone
and synovial fluid.

101
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,430
They cross the placenta,

102
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,870
they enter breast milk.

103
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:51,270
These are eight
different locations,

104
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:53,650
but they have been
chunked together.

105
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:57,450
just sort of
imagine a body and

106
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:59,350
think about where
the drugs are going.

107
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:03,650
CSF *********** is
poor we saw that

108
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:05,790
with the penicillins
group as well.

109
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:10,110
Now here are the
exceptions and all

110
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:12,130
of these drugs
have stars on them.

111
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:15,170
Cefuroxine is
second generation.

112
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,290
These three are third gen

113
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,230
and this is
the fourth gen.

114
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:27,370
These are all

115
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:33,830
somewhat structurally
related and they

116
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:38,510
all have better CSF
*********** than we

117
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:41,410
saw with the earlier
penicillins group.

118
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:45,450
Of course, when the
meninges are inflamed,

119
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:49,570
higher concentrations
are achieved

120
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:52,030
in the cerebral
spinal fluid.

121
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:53,510
All right, so what are

122
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:54,750
we talking about here?

123
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:58,390
If we have better
CSF ***********,

124
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:01,110
Assuming effectiveness,

125
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:07,430
think meningitis
treatment.

126
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:10,490
Try and put these
concepts together.

127
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:19,270
We eliminated
glomerular filtration

128
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,070
and secretion of
unchanged drug,

129
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:23,470
just like the
beta-lactam's

130
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:26,270
general pharmacokinetic
properties.

131
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,670
There is an exception.

132
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:34,490
This is ceftriaxone,
super important drug.

133
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:38,730
Triaxone, triaxone,
triaxone, ceftriaxone,

134
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:40,710
oop, excuse me, I
pushed the wrong button.

135
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:49,770
Biliary excretion,
therefore the

136
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:53,270
adjustment for
renal impairment,

137
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:55,910
dose adjustment,
is not required.

138
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:01,370
and then the advanced
generations are also

139
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:04,300
excreted in the urine
as active drug now

140
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:07,610
half-life short we
thought we talked about

141
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:11,070
that with the penicillins
another exception

142
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:14,620
ceftriaxone once
a day except for

143
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,570
meningitis in which
we need higher

144
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:19,850
concentrations of
drug to get into and

145
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:22,530
kill that organism,
it's twice a day.

146
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:27,670
Please know these
terms, these features.

147
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,530
This is just a scheme.

148
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:39,290
The spectrums of
action generally

149
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:42,310
increase through
the generations.

150
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:46,800
This makes sense because
the first generation,

151
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,670
cephalosporins of
which cefazolin is

152
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:56,390
the prototype have
gram positive gram

153
00:08:56,390 --> 00:09:01,030
positive and very
little gram negative so

154
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:04,910
streptococci methicillin
sensitive staph

155
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:09,570
aureus so it's an
alternative to the penicillin

156
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:13,350
penicillinase resistant
group although

157
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:15,350
the penicillinase
resistant group are

158
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,030
generally preferred
because they're more

159
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:20,650
active, they act
more quickly than the

160
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:23,350
cephalosporins, but
these are a good option.

161
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:25,650
And the gram negative,

162
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:29,310
P-E-K,

163
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:31,170
well C-K,

164
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:34,450
proteus, E. coli,
and Klebsiella,

165
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:36,050
makes it easy
to remember.

166
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:40,570
So first generation
spectrum of action,

167
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:44,790
aerobic gram-positive,
including MSSA,

168
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:48,490
and the gram-negatives,
enterobacteriales,

169
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:52,750
or Proteus, E. coli,
Klebsiella, PEC.

170
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:55,030
Second generation,

171
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,110
okay.

172
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:59,290
Well, we didn't get
much gram-negative

173
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:01,770
out of it, so they
were developed

174
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:04,390
to increase gram
-negative activity.

175
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:06,310
And we pick up a few

176
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:08,490
respiratory
organisms here.

177
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:11,370
Moricella and
Haemophilus.

178
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:14,330
Okay, now there's
another group

179
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:16,810
in here, a subgroup.
These are called

180
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,850
cefamycins
because they come

181
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:21,850
from a different
microbial source.

182
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:27,150
These are effective
against Bacteroides

183
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:31,030
fragilis, that obligate
anaerobe that's

184
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,910
difficult to treat. Of
course, resistance is

185
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:36,490
rising. We need to
always remember that.

186
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,790
But susceptible
Bacteroides

187
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:41,690
fragilis will respond
to cefamycins.

188
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:46,990
They also have
this activity.

189
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:50,650
Third generation, as I

190
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,230
said, super
important group.

191
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:57,990
They have good
activity against the

192
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:02,290
gram positives,
including pneumococci.

193
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:06,190
except septazidine
oh there's

194
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:07,990
always got to be
an exception right

195
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:13,210
septazidine is good
against pseudomonas the

196
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:17,510
others the others that
we saw above are not

197
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:23,370
fourth generation
this is a broad

198
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:25,730
spectrum well
extended spectrum

199
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:27,490
but much broader
than above

200
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:33,470
enteric non-enteric
gram-negative bacteria

201
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:36,490
and pseudomonas
you see how it's

202
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:42,490
increasing as we go
down cefepime is more

203
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:46,310
stable against certain
chromosomal beta

204
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:51,830
-lactamases of the gram
-negative That said,

205
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:56,490
there are many organisms
that produce beta

206
00:11:56,490 --> 00:12:02,820
-lactamases that none
of the cephalosporins,

207
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:06,830
or beta-lactams actually,
will respond to.

208
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:10,630
Advanced generation.
I'll get to

209
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:13,440
that in a couple
of slides. Okay,

210
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:17,570
so our first generation,
narrow spectrum,

211
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:23,050
we see this and
this. That's it.

212
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:25,190
Easy to remember.

213
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:29,630
our second generation

214
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:38,290
oops let's go back
just watch this don't

215
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:43,330
write first generation
second generation

216
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:48,070
we pick up a few more
plus the cefamycins

217
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:52,190
here third generation
you see it's

218
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:56,470
expanding the
enterobacteriales, this is

219
00:12:56,470 --> 00:13:01,190
the gut bugs,
facultative anaerobic gut

220
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:04,070
bugs, we call them
gram-negative aerobes,

221
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,490
aerobic bacilli,

222
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:08,950
quite a few.
This remains the

223
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:11,250
same, this
doesn't change,

224
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,470
so try and group
this and develop

225
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:15,750
patterns. Oh,
look at this,

226
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:19,250
gonorrhea,

227
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:21,170
ceftriaxone.

228
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:26,490
Please remember
ceftriaxone and gonorrhea.

229
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:30,690
And spirochetes.

230
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:35,130
Ceftriaxone is good for a

231
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:37,250
lot of different
infections.

232
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:40,850
Now the fourth
generation. This

233
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,520
is the difference
here from the third

234
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:52,000
generation. Stable to
many beta-lactamases, but

235
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,580
not stable to also
many beta-lactamases.

236
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,980
now our advanced
generation there

237
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:04,920
are different
authors put different

238
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,660
drugs in this group
i'm just putting

239
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:10,580
these two in here
this is how i see

240
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:14,520
it so ceftaroline
and cefiterolol

241
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,700
The big claim to fame

242
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,840
for cefteraline is MRSA.

243
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:25,900
This is the only beta
-lactam available in

244
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:29,860
the United States that
has activity against

245
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,800
methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus

246
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:38,520
aureus. It also has
activity against penicillin

247
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,960
-resistant streptococcus
pneumoniae.

248
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:49,920
Cephidrocol is an
interesting drug.

249
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,080
This is the one
that's very recently

250
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,020
been developed
compared to the

251
00:14:55,020 --> 00:15:00,700
others. It chelates
free iron, ferric

252
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:05,960
ions, in the
extracellular spaces.

253
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:12,180
This complexing together
with the iron allows

254
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:15,640
sephitricol to pass
into gram-negative

255
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:20,500
aerobic bacteria by
their iron transport

256
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:24,920
systems. So it gets
through that outer membrane

257
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:31,580
reaches the PBP target
and is therefore

258
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:34,660
effective against
these aerobic gram

259
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:38,320
-negative organisms. So
I've made a chart here,

260
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:41,420
ceftarolene here,
cefiterolol here.

261
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,700
Cefiterolol is just
these gram-negative

262
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:51,120
aerobic enteric, but
that's a big just.

263
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,060
It is effective
against multidrug

264
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:59,020
-resistant gram-negative
bacteria, ESBL and

265
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:04,940
AMPC-producing,
multidrug-resistant

266
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:13,480
GNBs, and pseudomonas,
an important drug.

267
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:18,500
Of course, I believe
we'll be seeing

268
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,100
resistance in
the future. There

269
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,180
are already signs
of it, and it

270
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,980
hasn't been around
all that long.

271
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,460
Cepterolene, we see
our grand positives,

272
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:33,390
and we have some
grand negative aerobic

273
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,620
enteric bugs and
non-enteric bugs.

274
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,400
What are we using
these two drugs for?

275
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,180
let's look at
the federal call

276
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:50,440
first hospital
acquired and

277
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,600
ventilator
associated pneumonia

278
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:58,380
complicated urinary
tract infections multi

279
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:01,260
-drug resistant
pseudomonas infections

280
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:06,560
easy to remember
complicated drugs that

281
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:10,380
have bugs that have
multi-drug resistance

282
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,460
ceftarolene well
streptococcus pneumoniae

283
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:19,820
causes pneumonia so
community acquired

284
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:23,800
pneumonia hospital
acquired pneumonia so

285
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,960
bugs that have been
acquired in the hospital

286
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:30,440
and ventilator
associated pneumonia

287
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:37,040
bacteremia and skin and
soft tissue infection

288
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:40,160
so if you can sort
of chunk these ideas,

289
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,360
see the patterns,
make your own tables.

290
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,620
This

291
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:52,550
apparently really dense
material, antibiotic

292
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:55,580
therapies, will
start to come clear

293
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:58,620
for you and you'll start
to see the patterns,

294
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:01,000
you'll start to
chunk ideas together.

295
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:04,900
And if you can do
that now you'll be

296
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,780
reminded of these as
we go along and you'll

297
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:10,320
see them in clinical
in your clinical

298
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,800
rotations you'll appreciate
it in the future.

299
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,560
Acquired resistance
naturally beta

300
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,880
-lactamase production
and altered PBPs,

301
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:28,740
ESBLs, extended spectrum
beta-lactamases,

302
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,840
is resistance to
all penicillins

303
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:38,860
and cephalosporins,
multidrug

304
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:41,520
resistance, bacteroides,
it's intrinsically

305
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,220
resistant to
many antibiotics,

306
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,760
cefamycins,

307
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:49,280
these, I only have one

308
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,440
that's starred,
cefoxitin,

309
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:55,580
foxy cefoxitin
is good against

310
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:58,540
this tough
bacteroides fragilis.

311
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,040
Amp-C beta-lactamases.

312
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:09,180
So the early beta
-lactamase inhibitors

313
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,920
are not effective
against the Amp-C, but

314
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:17,140
the later beta-lactamase
inhibitors are.

315
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:23,200
Amp-C are chromosomally
encoded and inducible.

316
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,220
They also can pass
through peloporins.

317
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:30,120
I have not starred
these organisms. You do

318
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,860
not need to memorize
them, but I have seen

319
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:38,020
them appear on board
practice questions.

320
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:47,770
Altered target penicillin
binding proteins.

321
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:52,950
These organisms that
have these altered PVPs

322
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:57,510
are resistant to all
cephalosporins except

323
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:07,290
for this one which is
ceftaroline but all

324
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:10,910
the rest are susceptible
anterococcus listeria

325
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:15,410
and of course the
atypical respiratory

326
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:19,090
pathogens all the beta
-lactamins are unable to

327
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,950
eradicate them either
because like mycoplasma,

328
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:26,410
it doesn't have a
peptidoglycancel wall,

329
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:29,670
or legionella and
chlamytophila,

330
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:32,610
which are obligate
intracellular.

331
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:38,450
They're all not
active against C.

332
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:40,470
difficile, so we
can get C. difficile

333
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:43,610
infections with the
use of the antibiotics.

334
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:47,490
And Campylobacter
jejuni, I did not put,

335
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:50,410
I did not emphasized
to you. It is a really

336
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:52,410
an important cause
of acute diarrhea,

337
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:55,290
especially in
kids, and the

338
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:57,630
cephalosporins
are ineffective.

339
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:03,430
Resistence.
Gram positive,

340
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:06,650
the MDR, Streptococcus

341
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:08,990
pneumoniae, except
ceftaroline,

342
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:11,750
MRSA, except ceftaroline,

343
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:15,450
Enterococcus,
Listeria, C. difficile.

344
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:18,930
Of the gram
-negatives, the KPC

345
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:22,550
-producing
enterobacteriales,

346
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:26,250
campylobacter,
stenotrophomonas,

347
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:29,330
which I did not put
a star on, but it's

348
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:33,490
multidrug-resistant
intrinsically.

349
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:35,230
Acinetobacter,
the same thing.

350
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:38,230
Atypicals I just
talked about.

351
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:46,150
this is the generations
all put on one

352
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:50,050
table for their
therapeutic use we remember

353
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:51,990
the first generation
or gram positive

354
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:53,710
impact so what do
we think about with

355
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:56,670
gram positive think
about skin flora

356
00:21:56,670 --> 00:22:01,370
gram positive skin
flora skin infections

357
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,670
gram positive can also
cause uncomplicated

358
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:08,110
urinary tract
infections certain ones

359
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:10,650
that i didn't
emphasize that you know

360
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:16,450
and proteus e coli
and klebsiella

361
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:18,170
so we use the fazolin for

362
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,390
surgical prophylaxis
it's given

363
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:23,990
within an hour
of surgery to

364
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:30,150
prevent the infection
by skin flora

365
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,670
cephalexin is oral
can be used for

366
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:36,530
uncomplicated infections
second generation is not

367
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:38,810
used for much to tell
you the truth the

368
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:43,330
second generation are
not as good not as

369
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:46,330
active against gram
positive as the first

370
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:49,590
generation and they're
not as active as the

371
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:54,110
third generation
against gram negatives

372
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:59,490
and I haven't put on
here the oral third

373
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:02,370
-generation agents,
except for Seftonair.

374
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:05,230
Seftonair is
widely, widely used.

375
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:06,190
You're going to
see that in your

376
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:08,890
clinical rotations.
Others also.

377
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:14,310
But the oral agents
are better than the

378
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:17,690
oral agents of the
second generation for

379
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:20,290
treating upper
respiratory, lower

380
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:24,510
respiratory tract
infections UTIs otitis media

381
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:27,830
that sort of thing
fourth generation

382
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:31,330
severe infections it's
broad spectrum and

383
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:33,650
that's what we
usually reserve it for

384
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:38,170
advanced generation
well MRSA think

385
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:42,430
skin flora so skin
skin structure

386
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:45,290
infections community
acquired pneumonia

387
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:48,670
these are the main
therapeutic uses

388
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:51,850
of cefiterolene,
cefiterocol, all those

389
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:53,450
things that I went
through before.

390
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:58,690
Now, all of the
parenteral cephalosporins

391
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:02,110
can cause
thrombophobitis when

392
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:05,810
given intravenously,
and the intramuscular

393
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:07,550
injection is
kind of painful.

394
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:19,000
Third generation
cephalosporins are most

395
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,240
commonly prescribed.
So why is this?

396
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,600
Well, they're effective
against a number

397
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,040
of common infections.
They have this

398
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:31,340
extended spectrum of
activity, it's called.

399
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:36,110
They get those GNBs.

400
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:39,600
Stable against
the common beta

401
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,320
-lactamases of the
gram-negative bacilli.

402
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,880
Common.

403
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:51,440
The gram-positive bacteria,
they have activity

404
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,270
against penicillin
non-susceptible strep

405
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:56,610
pneumoniae. It's
called non-susceptible.

406
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:00,660
and other gram
-positive species.

407
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,400
It's less potent activity
against methicillin

408
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,980
-sensitive staph
aureus. Remember, the

409
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:11,060
nafcillin group of
the penicillins, these

410
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:13,600
are the most active,
they work quickly.

411
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,100
And the first generation,

412
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:22,240
cefazolin, and its oral

413
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,640
counterpart, are
preferred for MSSA.

414
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:31,440
The third
-generation cefts are

415
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,840
highly active
against the gut bugs.

416
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:38,980
Neisseria meningitidis,
so meningitis

417
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:41,280
caused by Neisseria
meningitis,

418
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:45,200
and meningitis caused
by other organisms,

419
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,020
such as Streptococcus
pneumoniae,

420
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:51,520
such as Haemophilus
influenzae.

421
00:25:54,460 --> 00:26:00,280
But ceftazidime and
a newer one now,

422
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:06,560
ceftolazine, which is
hooked up with tazobactam,

423
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,520
are the only ones
in this group that

424
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,120
have Pseudomonas
aeruginosa activity.

425
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,380
Important to remember.

426
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,300
cefotaxime and ceftriaxone
we think of together

427
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,980
and i'll go into that
in more detail on

428
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:29,080
the next slide they are
agents of choice for

429
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:32,000
the treatment of
meningitis how important is

430
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,080
it well meningitis is
deadly and we need to

431
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:40,680
know the drugs that
are effective and safe

432
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:50,590
ceftriaxone a single
IM injection is the

433
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:56,020
only CDC recommended
treatment of uncomplicated

434
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:58,530
gonorrhea. How
important is it to know

435
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:02,570
this? It's the only
drug that's really,

436
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:06,670
really effective at
this point. Many drugs

437
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:10,490
have been effective
in the past. However,

438
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:13,370
Neisseria gonorrhea
has developed

439
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:15,930
considerable multi
-drug resistance.

440
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:23,650
Ceftriaxone and
cefotaxime, first of

441
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:25,840
all, they have the same
spectrum of activity,

442
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,830
both administered
parenterally,

443
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:32,170
they're widely
distributed in body fluids

444
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:34,510
and tissues, including
the cerebral spinal

445
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:38,310
fluid, especially
in patients with

446
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:42,490
meningitis. So what
differentiates them?

447
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,230
You need to know this.

448
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:49,070
Ceftriaxone is
on this side,

449
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:51,310
cefotaxime is
on this side.

450
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:55,090
Ceftriaxone is eliminated

451
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,410
via the biliary system.

452
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:01,260
So it goes out through

453
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,030
the liver into the gut.

454
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,870
It's not metabolized,

455
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:07,370
but it goes out that way.

456
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:09,830
So high concentrations
are going to be

457
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:13,250
in the gallbladder,
which makes it really

458
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:16,580
useful for acute
cholecystitis but

459
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:20,470
it can also cause
biliary sludging and

460
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:22,870
gallstone formation.
This is not something

461
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:24,570
that's going to
happen with one dose

462
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:27,190
or a few doses.
It's more long term.

463
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:32,330
Cephotaxine goes
out unchanged in the

464
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:35,270
urine just like
the general class

465
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:38,570
effects of the beta
lactams actually.

466
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:43,710
Ceftriaxone does not
need dose adjustment

467
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:45,570
in patients with
renal impairment.

468
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:48,570
Cefotaxime, look it
up in the literature

469
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:50,850
and see what the
dosing recommendations

470
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:53,910
are for patients with
renal impairment.

471
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:57,770
Ceftriaxone has that
longer half-life.

472
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:00,970
Cefotaxime is short,
requires every

473
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:02,930
six to eight hours
dosing compared

474
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:05,150
to ceftriaxone's
one-time daily.

475
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:09,610
Uh-oh, let's talk
about babies.

476
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:11,930
Brand new
babies, neonates.

477
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:22,660
Cephotaxime is
preferred in neonates.

478
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:25,220
Well, why in the
world is that?

479
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,640
Let's see the difference.

480
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:33,220
Ceftriaxone is highly
bound to plasma

481
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:35,580
proteins, so
it's quite potent

482
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:38,580
on those plasma
proteins, and it can

483
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:41,900
displace unconjugated
bilirubin.

484
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:47,020
Neonates have
immature metabolic

485
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:49,960
systems and renal
systems because

486
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,480
they're brand
new. Their systems

487
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,700
are going to
continue to mature.

488
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,500
As a result,

489
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:02,200
this unconjugated
bilirubin floats around

490
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,940
as free bilirubin
in the bloodstream.

491
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:09,400
Well, neonates also
have a leaky blood

492
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,500
-brain barrier because
it's not fully

493
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:16,180
mature, especially
********* neonates.

494
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:21,700
The unconjugated bilirubin
can move into the

495
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:25,840
CNS tissues, and that
can cause encephalopathy

496
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,520
in the newborn. And
that encephalopathy

497
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:31,920
is called kernicterus.
It will be worth

498
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:35,880
your time to learn
this word, kernicterus,

499
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:39,340
and what it is. I
suggest you might want to

500
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,800
look it up. It will
only take you a few

501
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:45,300
minutes, but it will
help you understand how

502
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:49,480
serious kernicterus
can be, encephalopathy.

503
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,820
Now that's one, the

504
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:54,180
hyperbilirubinemia. Two,

505
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:01,540
ceftriaxone can cause
precipitation of

506
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:05,280
calcium in calcium
-containing solutions.

507
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,140
It forms a complex
with calcium, and

508
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,800
it precipitates.
And this precipitant

509
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:14,360
can deposit in lung
and kidney tissues

510
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:17,020
and damage those
tissues in the neonate.

511
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:19,840
Cephaltaxime
doesn't do any of

512
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,560
these things. That's
why cephalotaxime

513
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,860
is preferred in neonates.

514
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,560
Adverse effects?
Well, painful IM

515
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:35,380
injection, thrombophlebitis
from the IV,

516
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:38,740
renal tubular
necrosis, and

517
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:41,220
interstitial nephritis
are reported.

518
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,360
They're fortunately
rare, but

519
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,210
they can have
serious consequences,

520
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:49,280
so we just
monitor for them.

521
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,480
Ceftriaxone,
biliary stasis,

522
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:56,360
cholestatic hepatitis
makes sense because

523
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,700
it goes out
through the biliary

524
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,620
system. Neonates
I talked about.

525
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:03,800
Cephotetin does not
have a star. I have

526
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:07,680
seen this in the board
review questions.

527
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:11,540
Cephotetin can cause
hypoprothrombinemia

528
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:16,900
and And it can cause
this disulfiram type of

529
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:21,120
reaction, which
simply means flushing,

530
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:31,440
nausea, vomiting, when
the drug is given to a

531
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,300
patient who has alcohol
in the bloodstream.

532
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,100
That's it.

533
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:41,300
I'm not going to go
over these check your

534
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:44,800
knowledge questions
because I don't want

535
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,100
to extend the time
of this lecture

536
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:51,200
unduly, but they're here
for you. I recommend

537
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,500
that you pause the
video and while

538
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:57,640
it's still fresh in your
mind, try and answer

539
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,920
these questions
without looking at the

540
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,660
answers. The answers
are listed in the

541
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:07,000
end of this video
and also we just saw

542
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,200
everything coming up
to these questions.

543
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:15,080
So the carbapenems
now. I put

544
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,060
stars really
on two of them,

545
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:20,840
but two of them
are combined with

546
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:24,050
a beta-lactamase
inhibitor. So So

547
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:27,040
remember two and
remember them

548
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,060
with the beta
-lactamase inhibitor.

549
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:33,570
So let's talk first
about psilastatin.

550
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,080
Imapenem was the first
of the carbapenems

551
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,400
to be developed,
and it needed to

552
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,720
be combined with
psilastatin. So is

553
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,240
psilastatin a beta
-lactamase inhibitor?

554
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:49,960
No. So, psilostatin
inhibits an enzyme

555
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:54,520
in the kidneys called
dehydropeptidase

556
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:57,020
1. It's located
in the proximal

557
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:59,020
renal tubule, and
there's a brushboard

558
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,720
in there, so
that's where it is.

559
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:08,120
Dehydropeptidase 1
inactivates imipenem. So,

560
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:11,840
by putting the
psilostatin in there, that

561
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:17,960
blocks this drug, the
actions of the drug

562
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:23,220
to inactivate
imipenem. So, imipenem,

563
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:27,900
psilostatin levels are
high in the urine, which

564
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:30,980
makes it useful for
infections in the urinary

565
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:34,000
tract, including
complicated infections.

566
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:40,180
Meropenem came along
second, and there

567
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:44,140
are very little
difference between these

568
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:46,600
in terms of the
spectrum of action.

569
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:50,960
Of course, as
we've talked about,

570
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:56,300
multi-drug resistant
organisms, carbapenemase

571
00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:00,100
producing enhancing
gram-negative

572
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:05,820
bacteria that are resistant
to all beta-lactams,

573
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:08,220
including the
carbapenems. Carbapenems

574
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:11,340
were developed specifically
for the purpose

575
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:14,600
of being stable in
the presence of beta

576
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,540
-lactamases. But of
course the organisms,

577
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:20,200
because of
selection pressure,

578
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:24,630
because of their
random mutations

579
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:29,040
that bacteria make
developed resistance

580
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,680
to the carbapenems
as well.

581
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:36,000
So you may recall that
relibactam, babrobactam

582
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:42,040
are effective against
those KPC producing

583
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:46,640
and AMPC producing
bacteria. So that's why

584
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:51,160
they've been combined
here. So, I'm not

585
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:54,630
asking you to remember
ertapenem or dorapenem.

586
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,340
You may be expected
to know that

587
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:58,820
at some future
point, but you

588
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:00,340
don't need to
know it for now.

589
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,400
Spectrum of
action. Look at

590
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,620
how broad spectrum
these are.

591
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:11,160
Stable to many beta
-lactamases, as I said.

592
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:16,900
So the enterobacteriales,
they are able,

593
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:20,820
especially with their
beta-lactamase inhibitor,

594
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:24,840
able to treat
infections, serious

595
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,000
infections caused
by these organisms.

596
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,780
Again, enterococcus
faecium

597
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:36,880
is not susceptible to it.

598
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:41,620
clostridium clostridioides
difficile is

599
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:44,260
not susceptible we
see that we think

600
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:47,260
overgrowth think secondary
infection otherwise

601
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:50,360
pretty broad
spectrum think about

602
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:53,860
the pattern chunk
things together it's

603
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:56,700
easier than memorizing
each and every bug

604
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:02,920
broad spectrum
some resistance

605
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,560
as i mentioned
gram positive

606
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,820
gram negative
aerobic anaerobic

607
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:09,740
Penicillin-resistant
streptococcus

608
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:10,840
pneumoniae. While
there are other

609
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,140
drugs, there are
not quite as broad

610
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:15,280
spectrum that
might be preferred.

611
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:17,440
Penicillin-sensitive

612
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,120
enterococcus
fecalis, not Fesium.

613
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:23,180
Stable to most beta
-lactamases, but not the

614
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:26,080
carbapenemases or
metallobeta-lactamases.

615
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:31,200
Treatment of choice
for ESBL-expressing

616
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,340
enterobacteriales,
anaerobes including

617
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:37,540
B fragilis,
pseudomonas aeruginosa.

618
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:41,480
Pseudomonas is known for
developing resistance

619
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:44,600
during therapy
so very often if

620
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:50,920
pseudomonas is identified
or suspected two anti

621
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,040
-pseudomonas drugs
will be put together.

622
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:56,480
Now pseudomonas this
is the exception

623
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:59,180
Erdapenem.

624
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,340
As I said, I'm not
asking you to remember

625
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:04,340
Erdapenem. It's the
sort of thing that

626
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:06,280
could appear on a board
exam and certainly

627
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,700
you need to know it
if you're going to

628
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:11,980
be taking an infectious
disease rotation.

629
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,800
KPCs, metallobetalactamases
resistance.

630
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,680
Intrinsic resistance.

631
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:27,960
When you have a broad
-spectrum drug in

632
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,560
front of you, it's
just so much easier

633
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,680
to remember what's
resistant to it,

634
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,450
intrinsically resistant,
than trying to

635
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:37,480
enumerate everything
that it's effective

636
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:40,940
against that's susceptible
to it. So MRSA,

637
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,780
Enderococcus faecium,
C. difficile,

638
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,720
and this crazy MDR bug,

639
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:53,200
Stenotrophomonas
multifilla.

640
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:54,720
That's something you will

641
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,940
like to know
about later on.

642
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:02,260
Treatment with
carbapenos.

643
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:05,600
Basically, serious
infections. infections,

644
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,840
lower respiratory,
intra-abdominal,

645
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,880
pelvic, skin, soft
tissue, bone joint. So

646
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,740
serious infections
in many locations

647
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:20,380
caused by especially
gram-negative organisms,

648
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:23,100
but possibly by
gram-positive

649
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:26,040
bacteria. But we have
other drugs really that

650
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,560
are not as huge
spectrum that are also

651
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,420
effective against
the gram positive.

652
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:33,940
Adverse effects,
seizures,

653
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:38,040
especially imipenem,
especially people

654
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,740
with renal
insufficiency. Why renal

655
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:43,880
insufficiency? Because
they're not clearing the

656
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:49,240
drug as efficiently
as a healthy kidney,

657
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:53,260
and the blood levels
can accumulate,

658
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:58,400
the drug can get into
the CNS, and high

659
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,260
concentration is enough
to cause seizures.

660
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,660
Bleeding,
agranulocytosis.

661
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:12,520
These are seen.
They don't happen.

662
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:16,140
They're fairly
rare, not completely

663
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:19,080
rare. So what do we
do? we watch for it.

664
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,380
GI nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea,

665
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:25,880
pretty common. When
I say diarrhea,

666
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,900
unless I say C.
difficile associated

667
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:30,520
diarrhea, I'm
just talking about

668
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:33,940
non-secondary
infection diarrhea

669
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:36,960
and C. difficile
super infection.

670
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:41,060
So let's talk about
now what happens

671
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:43,660
when we add the beta
-lactamase inhibitor.

672
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:55,360
Inhibit Ambler class
A beta-lactamases,

673
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:58,780
including KPCs,
and also the class

674
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:03,360
C, AMP-C beta
-lactamases, but not the

675
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:07,700
metallobeta-lactamases.
None of the drugs

676
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:10,360
is effective against
organisms that

677
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:13,140
produce those
metallobeta-lactamases.

678
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:21,320
Relobactam improves
imipenem activity

679
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,400
against most
enterobacteriallies

680
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:26,640
and non-susceptible
pseudomonas.

681
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:31,660
Vabrobactam improves
meropenem activity

682
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:33,840
against most of the
enterobacteriallies.

683
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:38,520
Relobactam does not
improve imipenem

684
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:41,140
activity against
these two multi

685
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:43,140
-drug resistant
organisms that I have

686
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:45,080
not asked you to
memorize by name.

687
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,060
But I must mention these

688
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:50,480
things for context.

689
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:54,280
Vabrobactam has not
shown to improve

690
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,020
meropenem
activity against

691
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:59,580
Pseudomonas or these
other two bad bugs.

692
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,840
Finally,

693
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:07,180
the monobactam astreanam.

694
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:09,620
Finally, in terms
of beta-lactams,

695
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,140
You may notice
the structure

696
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:13,320
looks quite different.

697
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:16,480
This ring here
is not attached

698
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,960
to the beta-lactam ring.

699
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:20,600
So that's why
it's called a

700
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,280
monobactam. The beta
-lactam ring is kind

701
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,940
of hanging out
here by itself.

702
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:31,640
IV, IM, widely
distributed, renal

703
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:35,200
excretion. Here's the
big takeaway with S

704
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:40,060
-trianam. Only gram
-negative aerobic

705
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:44,600
cocci and bacilli,
including Pseudomonas

706
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:47,480
aeruginosa. You see
the pattern here?

707
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:49,860
Chunk it all together.

708
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:53,620
Gram-negative
aerobic organisms,

709
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:56,540
including Pseudomonas.

710
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,480
So resistance,

711
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:01,000
gram-positives, and some

712
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:01,720
of the enterobacteriales.

713
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:06,200
Sorry, I keep pushing
that wrong. button.

714
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:12,160
ESBLs, KPC, AMPC beta
-lactamases, and of

715
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,540
course the metallo
-beta-lactamases will,

716
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:19,040
organisms producing
these will

717
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,880
be resistant to
the Aztreonam.

718
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:26,460
What do we use it
for? Well, it's going

719
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:29,800
to be renally
excreted, producing

720
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,480
high concentrations
of active drug in

721
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,000
the urine, so urinary
tract infections.

722
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,160
Also,

723
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:37,620
gram-negative lower

724
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:39,820
respiratory
tract infections.

725
00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:43,700
Bacteremia, skin
and skin structure,

726
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:46,320
intra-abdominal
pelvic infections.

727
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:49,440
So it's got a lot
of uses as long

728
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,240
as it's gram
-negative infections.

729
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:52,920
Interestingly,

730
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,880
cystic fibrosis
patients, which have

731
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:00,220
just gunk in
their lungs, tend

732
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:02,600
to get pseudomonas
lung infections.

733
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:05,840
So astreanam has
been developed into

734
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:09,660
an inhalation
product so that the

735
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:11,480
patient can just
breathe in the

736
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:14,820
astreanam, which
will go in high

737
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:17,260
concentrations right
into the lung tissue.

738
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:22,840
So thinking about
empiric therapy.

739
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:25,180
Remember empiric
therapy? That's when we

740
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:28,000
don't know what the
organism is. the patient

741
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,160
is presenting with
signs and symptoms

742
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:33,360
of infection. We
can't wait to treat

743
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:36,460
it, so we have to
use a broad-spectrum

744
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:38,220
organisms that's
going to hit the gram

745
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:41,270
-positive and gram
-negative potential

746
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:44,200
pathogens that it's
causing the infection.

747
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:48,480
So we cannot use
STRIANAM. It's got a

748
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,680
narrow spectrum,
gram-negative only.

749
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:52,340
Aerobes.

750
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:57,920
It has a low immunogenic
potential. We've

751
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,980
been talking about
cross-reactivity.

752
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:05,940
Anybody who has a
penicillin allergy with

753
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:10,060
anaphylaxis, what is
the likelihood that

754
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:14,760
the patient will have
an allergic reaction

755
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:17,760
to other beta-lactams?
Well, Astrianam

756
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:21,080
has a very low
immunogenic potential. You

757
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:23,980
may recall the
structure is completely

758
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:27,020
different than the
others. There is one

759
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:30,680
exception and that is
ceftazidine. If a person

760
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:33,920
has had an anaphylactic
response to

761
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:37,140
ceftazidine they really
should not get estrianab

762
00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:40,520
because it has a
similar side chain.

763
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:46,460
Usual common adverse
effects of antibiotics,

764
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:51,320
IV, thrombophlebitis,
yes C.

765
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:53,980
difficile super
infection is a potential.

766
00:45:54,680 --> 00:46:00,020
So there are many
similarities of

767
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:03,940
Astrianam with
the class effects.

768
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:09,160
this is different
and this is different

769
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:16,640
so moving now away
from our beta-lactams

770
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,160
to vancomycin which
is the only cell

771
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:22,720
wall inhibitor I have
put a I should say

772
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,420
non-beta-lactam cell
wall inhibitor that

773
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:28,680
I've put a star
on vancomycin is a

774
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:33,460
glycopeptide we see
the sugar residues here

775
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:37,040
and here is this big
ol looking protein.

776
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:39,380
It's a peptide.

777
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:49,340
Vancomycin is not
absorbed from the gut so

778
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:51,820
we can't give it ******.
It's administered

779
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:59,600
only IV for systemic
infections by slow infusion

780
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:05,200
in a dilute solution
because of a particular

781
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:08,360
adverse effect called
Redman syndrome,

782
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:15,160
which causes erythema,
flushing, and it's not

783
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:18,040
immune-related. It's
related directly to the

784
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:20,720
vancomycin, causing
the systemine release.

785
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:25,440
Widely distributed in
tissues and fluids.

786
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,080
It stays in the tissues
and fluids. It's not

787
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:32,420
going to cross into
intracellular spaces.

788
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,880
like the beta-lactams
low ***********

789
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,940
of the csf unless
the meninges are

790
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:43,340
inflamed like
the beta-lactams

791
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:47,000
glomerular filtration
of unchanged drug

792
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,960
half-life well this
is really going to

793
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:54,510
depend on renal
function vancomycin can

794
00:47:54,510 --> 00:47:57,080
cause nephrotoxicity
and nephrotoxicity

795
00:47:57,080 --> 00:48:00,500
during therapy can
reduce renal function.

796
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:04,260
So in a patient who
has excellent renal

797
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:06,840
function, the half-life
is about six hours.

798
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:10,500
But as that renal
function decreases,

799
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:13,840
the frequency
and dose of the

800
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:16,420
vancomycin need
to be reduced.

801
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:22,180
extending the
dosing interval and

802
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:25,060
lowering the dose
and or depending

803
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:28,500
on what the
renal function is

804
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:36,020
t greater than mic pkpd
profile and a short

805
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:41,680
antibiotic effect
And clinical efficacy

806
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:45,700
correlates with 24
-hour AUC to MIC ratio.

807
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:54,300
So the AUC to MIC
ratio is dependent. The

808
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:58,300
dose based on AUC to
MIC ratio is dependent

809
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:01,040
on the organism being
treated. So I've given

810
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,820
you an example here.
You don't need to

811
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:04,720
memorize these numbers,
but I think it will

812
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:09,700
help you to conceptualize
what we're talking

813
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:14,140
about with this PKPD
24-hour AUC to MIC

814
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:19,340
ratio concept of dosing
to maximize efficacy.

815
00:49:19,930 --> 00:49:22,740
And in the case
of vancomycin, it

816
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:25,900
actually minimizes
nephrotoxicity. So,

817
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:30,420
for MRSA, which
is a major use of

818
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:36,340
vancomycin, if the 24
-hour AUC to MIC ratio

819
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:43,660
falls between 400
and 600, the clinical

820
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:48,180
correlation with
success of therapy

821
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:52,840
for MRSA is demonstrated
by this number.

822
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:57,920
Bactericidal,
most of the time.

823
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:02,660
Mechanism of action.

824
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:08,660
This is that big
vancomycin chemical again.

825
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:16,320
It has affinity for
the D-alladiala on the

826
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:19,400
pentapeptide chain.
So this is right

827
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:24,400
here. and by hooking
up with that part of

828
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:29,640
the pentapeptide it
prevents the building

829
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:33,580
blocks to come together
so that's called

830
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:37,540
transglycosylation
it prevents the

831
00:50:38,310 --> 00:50:41,300
transglycosylation step
which is why they have

832
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:43,970
vancomycin right
here it doesn't block

833
00:50:43,970 --> 00:50:47,340
transglycosylase it
just prevents the step

834
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:50,380
because it's created
this big bulky thing.

835
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:54,520
And that's really
basically it.

836
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:57,680
Now let's talk
resistance.

837
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:05,160
Changing of the
site of action.

838
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:10,320
Some of these
organisms, Enterococci,

839
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:11,280
it's effective against

840
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:15,660
Enterococci, and
staphylococcus aureus.

841
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:20,940
So enterococci can
change the site here

842
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:29,800
from d-alladiala to
d-alladilactate. So d

843
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:32,660
-alladilactate. And
that's going to reduce

844
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:36,520
the affinity for
vancomycin such that

845
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:39,220
vancomycin becomes
completely ineffective.

846
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:50,090
Some more
information here.

847
00:51:50,930 --> 00:51:52,770
Spectrum of action.

848
00:51:52,930 --> 00:51:57,350
So important. Gram
-positive only. How easy

849
00:51:57,350 --> 00:52:00,810
is that to remember?
Gram-positive only.

850
00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:03,810
Particularly MRSA.

851
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:07,990
MRSA, MRSA, MRSA.
So vancomycin

852
00:52:07,990 --> 00:52:11,250
has been for many
decades the go-to

853
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:14,190
drug for the
treatment of MRSA.

854
00:52:14,970 --> 00:52:18,230
Of course, it'll be
effective against

855
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:22,590
MSSA and MSSE, but
the penicillinase

856
00:52:22,590 --> 00:52:25,070
-resistant penicillins,
the napcillin group,

857
00:52:25,290 --> 00:52:26,950
have better activity than

858
00:52:26,950 --> 00:52:28,810
vancomycin, and
they're preferred.

859
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:33,230
Vanco is also useful
against penicillin-

860
00:52:33,230 --> 00:52:36,010
resistant streptococcus
pneumoniae,

861
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:39,790
enterococcus fecalis,
and enterococcus faecium.

862
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:42,850
That's the first
time we've seen that,

863
00:52:42,850 --> 00:52:46,350
that anterococcus
faecium is susceptible.

864
00:52:47,970 --> 00:52:50,270
Intrinsic
resistance. Well,

865
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:53,450
all gram negatives.
That's it.

866
00:52:53,450 --> 00:52:55,470
That big bulky
molecule just

867
00:52:55,470 --> 00:52:56,850
can't get through
the porins.

868
00:52:57,490 --> 00:53:01,230
And mycobacteria,
the drug doesn't

869
00:53:01,230 --> 00:53:04,150
get through the
cell wall of the

870
00:53:04,150 --> 00:53:07,070
mycobacteria.
Mycobacteria, for example,

871
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:09,850
cause tuberculosis.

872
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:15,970
Now, I mentioned
the DL-D-lactate

873
00:53:15,970 --> 00:53:19,510
preventing
vancomycin binding,

874
00:53:19,510 --> 00:53:21,890
so that's high
-level resistance.

875
00:53:23,610 --> 00:53:25,550
Staph aureus,

876
00:53:26,090 --> 00:53:31,030
well plasmids can, I
mean the Van A gene

877
00:53:31,030 --> 00:53:34,910
cluster can be passed
on through plasmids

878
00:53:34,910 --> 00:53:37,670
to staph aureus
and now that's high

879
00:53:37,670 --> 00:53:39,790
level resistance for
staph aureus too.

880
00:53:42,210 --> 00:53:47,150
and also Staph aureus
there's an this is

881
00:53:47,150 --> 00:53:52,050
intermediate resistance
it seems that

882
00:53:52,050 --> 00:53:56,810
the organism can
develop this thick cell

883
00:53:56,810 --> 00:54:00,190
wall because it's
got a lots of DL more

884
00:54:00,190 --> 00:54:03,350
than usual and that'll
trap the vancomycin

885
00:54:03,350 --> 00:54:07,030
within the cell
cell wall And as a

886
00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:11,590
result, the drug is
just not going to be as

887
00:54:11,590 --> 00:54:16,230
available to reduce
the MRSA infection.

888
00:54:19,310 --> 00:54:20,950
So MRSA,

889
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:23,510
you name it, anywhere the

890
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:25,340
drug can get to, MRSA.

891
00:54:26,010 --> 00:54:29,010
Bacteremia,
pneumonia, empyema,

892
00:54:29,350 --> 00:54:32,610
that's a ***** infection.

893
00:54:33,390 --> 00:54:35,710
endocarditis,
osteomyelitis, skin

894
00:54:35,710 --> 00:54:38,650
soft tissue
abscess, and more.

895
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:40,730
Penicillin-resistant

896
00:54:40,730 --> 00:54:43,970
enterococcus
endocarditis.

897
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:47,550
And if the organism
is not known,

898
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:50,790
if it's suspected
to be resistant,

899
00:54:50,970 --> 00:54:53,750
then vancomycin will just

900
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:55,830
be used as
empiric therapy.

901
00:54:57,290 --> 00:55:00,050
Meningitis due to
penicillinase-resistant

902
00:55:00,050 --> 00:55:02,930
streptococcus
pneumoniae. gram-positive

903
00:55:02,930 --> 00:55:05,810
infections in penicillin
-allergic patients.

904
00:55:05,810 --> 00:55:09,090
So here is an
option for people

905
00:55:09,090 --> 00:55:12,850
who have a
penicillin allergy

906
00:55:12,850 --> 00:55:14,950
and a gram
-positive injection.

907
00:55:15,090 --> 00:55:16,770
Now, C. difficile.

908
00:55:17,290 --> 00:55:21,230
Every single drug
up till now has

909
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:25,070
been a potential
cause of C. Well,

910
00:55:26,030 --> 00:55:28,690
oral vancomycin,
which of course is not

911
00:55:28,690 --> 00:55:34,650
absorbed from the
GI tract, will move

912
00:55:34,650 --> 00:55:38,950
through the intestine
to the gut, to the

913
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:43,130
lower small intestine
and large intestine,

914
00:55:43,130 --> 00:55:50,190
and it is used to
treat C. difficile.

915
00:55:50,310 --> 00:55:53,210
Oral vancomycin to treat

916
00:55:53,210 --> 00:55:54,930
C. difficile infection.

917
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:59,850
C. difficile, remember,
is a gram positive

918
00:55:59,850 --> 00:56:07,130
anaerobic rod and
vancomycin is effective.

919
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,680
Cautions, well,
nephrotoxicity.

920
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:18,880
Acute kidney injury
can occur and this is

921
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:22,040
usually in patients who
already have multiple

922
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:25,020
risk factors for
acute kidney injury.

923
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:29,780
Still we watch that
kidney function closely.

924
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:34,500
Non-immune
anaphylactoid infusion

925
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:37,120
related reaction.
This is the

926
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:39,580
red so-called
red man syndrome,

927
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:42,680
but patients
can have a true

928
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:44,980
hypersensitivity
reaction.

929
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:47,720
Phlebitis at the
injection site.

930
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:52,340
Some patients really
do need to get

931
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:55,120
long-term therapy
such as endocarditis

932
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:59,640
and we need to be
looking at white blood

933
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:02,000
cell count.
Neutropenia can occur.

934
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:04,980
Ototoxicity it's
much more rare

935
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:06,500
than it used to be
in the beginning

936
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:09,760
because vancomycin
which is a

937
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,560
natural substance
it comes from

938
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:15,900
a natural product
is much purer

939
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:17,500
now than it was
in the beginning.

940
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:22,320
Drug interactions.
Well, drugs with

941
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:25,400
the same toxicities,
especially

942
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:26,820
nephrotoxicity.

943
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:31,460
Ototoxicity, while rare,
becomes more likely

944
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:34,760
with other drugs that
cause ototoxicity.

945
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:37,480
So, nephrotoxicity, what

946
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:38,340
are we thinking about?

947
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:40,760
Aminoglycosides,
because we are going

948
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:42,660
to talk about this
group of drugs.

949
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:46,720
Diuretics,
loop diuretics.

950
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:53,840
Amphotericin B and
NSAIDs. Now I know for

951
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:56,270
you right now this
is just kind of

952
00:57:56,270 --> 00:57:58,880
memorization but I would
like you to remember

953
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:04,100
all of these. They
are so so important.

954
00:58:12,610 --> 00:58:16,430
So what do we do?
Well if a drug causes

955
00:58:16,430 --> 00:58:18,590
adverse effects, does
it mean we can't use

956
00:58:18,590 --> 00:58:21,070
it? Well, sometimes
it's contraindicated,

957
00:58:21,070 --> 00:58:25,380
but most of the time
we remain vigilant.

958
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:29,230
So how do we do that?
We monitor. So in terms

959
00:58:29,230 --> 00:58:31,590
of vancomycin, we
monitor the serum

960
00:58:31,590 --> 00:58:35,770
levels. We want to keep
the vancomycin in that

961
00:58:35,770 --> 00:58:40,130
range. So for example
MRSA we want to

962
00:58:40,130 --> 00:58:46,790
keep it in this 400 to
600 AUC to MIC ratio

963
00:58:46,790 --> 00:58:52,450
and we do that by
taking serum levels over

964
00:58:52,650 --> 00:58:57,450
time and figuring out
the AUC we already

965
00:58:57,450 --> 00:59:01,030
know the MIC from the
microbiology lab and

966
00:59:02,010 --> 00:59:04,810
of course we monitor
signs and symptoms

967
00:59:05,530 --> 00:59:07,910
always always monitor
for the signs and

968
00:59:07,910 --> 00:59:11,870
symptoms of adverse
effects and we have to

969
00:59:11,870 --> 00:59:14,470
let especially with
oral therapy when the

970
00:59:14,470 --> 00:59:16,690
patient's going home
you have to let them

971
00:59:16,690 --> 00:59:18,810
know what to expect
but we should do that

972
00:59:18,810 --> 00:59:23,930
in the hospital too
so our non-immune

973
00:59:23,930 --> 00:59:28,090
anaphylactoid meaning it
looks like anaphylaxis,

974
00:59:28,090 --> 00:59:31,550
but it isn't. It's
like anaphylaxis. So

975
00:59:31,550 --> 00:59:35,490
anaphylactoid infusion
-related reaction.

976
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,050
We see on the
left this very

977
00:59:38,050 --> 00:59:40,110
light-skinned
individual, so it's

978
00:59:40,110 --> 00:59:42,490
easy to make out
the flushing.

979
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:48,930
Here on the trunk,
and on the neck, and

980
00:59:48,930 --> 00:59:54,710
face, and see how
flushed it is. And on the

981
00:59:54,710 --> 00:59:57,050
right hand side, we
have a darker skinned

982
00:59:57,050 --> 01:00:01,780
individual, and it's
not as easy to identify.

983
01:00:02,850 --> 01:00:05,770
However, if the
patient is complaining

984
01:00:05,770 --> 01:00:08,650
about this hot feeling,
hot kind of itchy

985
01:00:08,650 --> 01:00:12,190
feeling on their
chest, neck, and face,

986
01:00:12,350 --> 01:00:16,030
then you know the
infusion is going in

987
01:00:16,030 --> 01:00:19,710
too fast and or is
not dilute enough.

988
01:00:19,810 --> 01:00:23,010
So this is not a
reason to withdraw the

989
01:00:23,010 --> 01:00:25,070
therapy. It just
has to be adjusted.

990
01:00:28,190 --> 01:00:29,990
And our last
drug that we'll

991
01:00:29,990 --> 01:00:33,330
talk about is daptomycin.

992
01:00:33,670 --> 01:00:38,470
It is a cyclic
lipopeptide. So

993
01:00:38,470 --> 01:00:42,230
here's the lipid
component and here

994
01:00:42,230 --> 01:00:45,550
is the circular
peptide component.

995
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:53,680
This part you may
need to know for the

996
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:55,640
boards. You don't have
to know it for now.

997
01:00:55,780 --> 01:00:56,960
So I just put
it down here

998
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:58,220
on the bottom in gray.

999
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:03,720
Dapnomycin profile,
G absorption, poor,

1000
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:05,640
so it's only IV.

1001
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:08,740
Distribution,
body fluids,

1002
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:10,940
high protein binding,

1003
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:14,500
low ***********
of unenflamed

1004
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:16,520
meninges, all
the same thing

1005
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:18,820
we've been seeing
all this time.

1006
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:21,500
So it's easy to
remember the differences

1007
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:24,520
because you've already
learned class effects.

1008
01:01:25,220 --> 01:01:31,680
An OK half
-life, of course,

1009
01:01:33,020 --> 01:01:40,020
renal, renal impairment,
adjust the dosage.

1010
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:43,280
PKPD profile, this
is concentration

1011
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:45,300
dependent and
it does have

1012
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:47,020
prolonged
persistent effects.

1013
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:51,980
And clinical
effect, as with the

1014
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:54,660
rest, is associated
with the AUC-MIC

1015
01:01:54,660 --> 01:01:57,980
ratio and it is
bactericidal. Okay,

1016
01:01:57,980 --> 01:01:59,600
so what's different
about this one?

1017
01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:03,440
Well, the mechanism
for one thing.

1018
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:06,540
And this is a
proposed mechanism of

1019
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:09,960
action based on
experimental observations.

1020
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:14,400
It appears that this
tail, this lipid

1021
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:19,600
tail, goes into
the membrane, and

1022
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:24,320
along with calcium,
it will form this

1023
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:29,800
complex, and it
will form a hole,

1024
01:02:30,210 --> 01:02:36,400
and from this hole,
ions will escape.

1025
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:43,140
and as that happens
there is a rest of DNA

1026
01:02:43,140 --> 01:02:46,040
RNA and protein
synthesis and when that

1027
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:50,380
happens rapid cell
death notice that cell

1028
01:02:50,380 --> 01:02:52,800
lysis does not occur
we're not talking

1029
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:58,160
about osmotic lysis
because of a cell wall

1030
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:01,160
action or lysis because
of any other reason.

1031
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:04,260
It's just the leakage
of ions and the

1032
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:07,160
arrest of DNA, RNA,
and protein synthesis.

1033
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:13,380
Taptomycin is
active against, oh,

1034
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:16,190
here we go again,
gram positive only.

1035
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:21,100
Aerobic, facultative
anaerobic, obligate

1036
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:23,360
anaerobic, so anything
gram positive,

1037
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:26,340
basically. Oh, here
we go again, MRSA,

1038
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:31,340
VESA, VERSA, V
-R-E. Okay, what

1039
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:32,700
do all those
letters mean?

1040
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:34,480
All right, MRSA,
you know that.

1041
01:03:34,580 --> 01:03:36,280
Methicillin
-resistant staph

1042
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:38,080
aureus, staph
epidermidis.

1043
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:42,740
Vancomycin-intermediate
sensitivity.

1044
01:03:44,060 --> 01:03:45,700
Sorry, vancomycin

1045
01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:48,220
-intermediate
staph aureus.

1046
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:52,500
Vancomycin
-resistant staph

1047
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:55,580
aureus. So, VERSA, MRSA.

1048
01:03:56,720 --> 01:04:02,720
Vancomycin-resistant
enterococci sounds

1049
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:05,940
pretty bad we want
vancomycin to be useful

1050
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:10,180
well when these resistances
occur we do have

1051
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:14,680
the alternative of
daptomycin complicated

1052
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:18,220
skin and soft tissue
infections endocarditis

1053
01:04:18,220 --> 01:04:20,400
bloodstream infections
osteomyelitis

1054
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:24,220
septic arthritis
meningitis on and on for

1055
01:04:24,220 --> 01:04:27,200
all of these various
infections caused by

1056
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:30,460
these resistant gram
-positive organisms.

1057
01:04:31,150 --> 01:04:33,380
So you can see
a blank square

1058
01:04:33,380 --> 01:04:35,700
here. What's
special about it?

1059
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:41,730
There is an interesting
characteristic

1060
01:04:43,620 --> 01:04:47,680
with daptomycin that
you really must know.

1061
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:52,460
Daptomycin is inactivated

1062
01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:54,620
by pulmonary surfactants.

1063
01:04:55,570 --> 01:04:57,740
So, of course,
it's not going

1064
01:04:57,740 --> 01:04:59,560
to be useful
for pneumonia

1065
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:04,720
as it concentrates
in the lungs and is

1066
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:07,380
inactivated by the
pulmonary surfactants.

1067
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:11,040
And because it's
useful only against

1068
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:12,500
gram-positive,
anything gram

1069
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:14,560
-negative is
inherently resistant.

1070
01:05:14,750 --> 01:05:17,920
Simple to remember.
Very simple drug.

1071
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:20,320
Simple like vancomycin.
You can think

1072
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:23,040
of them together
because they're so

1073
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:25,660
similar in their
spectrum of activity, but

1074
01:05:25,660 --> 01:05:27,680
totally different
in their mechanism.

1075
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:33,620
Daptomycin can
cause myopathy.

1076
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:36,420
So breakage of
skeletal muscle,

1077
01:05:36,430 --> 01:05:39,180
weakness in
skeletal muscle,

1078
01:05:39,580 --> 01:05:43,600
pain in skeletal
muscle, And in the worst

1079
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:47,360
case scenario,
breakage of those lysis

1080
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:49,320
of the skeletal
muscle cells that can

1081
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:58,140
lead to rhabdomyolysis
or rhabdomyolysis.

1082
01:06:00,870 --> 01:06:02,300
So what do we do?

1083
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:05,700
Do we withdraw the
drug? Well, we might

1084
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:08,020
have to, but we
want to prevent it.

1085
01:06:08,020 --> 01:06:10,260
So how do we prevent
it? By monitoring

1086
01:06:10,260 --> 01:06:14,300
the creatine fossil
kinase levels.

1087
01:06:14,660 --> 01:06:17,040
As these levels,
the creatine

1088
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:18,580
kinase levels increase,

1089
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:23,840
it is the result
of lysis of

1090
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:25,540
the skeletal
muscle cells.

1091
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:29,960
Also, if the patient
has new onset or

1092
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:32,620
worsening muscle pain
or weakness, that's

1093
01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:35,400
another indication
of the myopathy.

1094
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:39,040
Now, in addition,
we could look for

1095
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:43,420
peripheral neuropathy,
fever infiltrates,

1096
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:46,900
hypersensitivity
reactions, of course,

1097
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:50,160
always, and daptomycin
hypersensitivity

1098
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:52,120
reactions can
cause some serious

1099
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:58,660
adverse effects,
both immediate and

1100
01:06:58,660 --> 01:07:02,380
delayed, skin and
systemic symptoms.

1101
01:07:03,550 --> 01:07:05,820
Can we use it in
pregnancy? Well, there

1102
01:07:05,820 --> 01:07:07,460
isn't a whole lot
of information on

1103
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:10,640
that. If we're going
to be saving the

1104
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:13,980
life of the mother
and daptomycin is

1105
01:07:13,980 --> 01:07:16,780
the only effective
drug, that's going

1106
01:07:16,780 --> 01:07:18,940
to have to be a risk
-benefit decision.

1107
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:21,220
The drug is
excreted in breast

1108
01:07:21,220 --> 01:07:25,140
milk and there is dosing

1109
01:07:25,140 --> 01:07:27,780
guidance for
pediatric patients.

1110
01:07:28,660 --> 01:07:32,680
all right think
myopathy think

1111
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:35,240
about what other
drugs can cause

1112
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:38,300
myopathy and
that's statins

1113
01:07:38,990 --> 01:07:41,660
statins i'm sure you've
heard of along the

1114
01:07:41,660 --> 01:07:44,960
way in your lifetime
are these drugs for

1115
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:48,920
the treatment of high
blood cholesterol

1116
01:07:49,580 --> 01:07:53,640
hypercholesterolemia
millions and millions of

1117
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:56,340
patients are on statins
So we need to be

1118
01:07:56,340 --> 01:07:59,240
thinking about this
drug-drug interaction

1119
01:08:03,870 --> 01:08:04,730
monitor.

1120
01:08:05,910 --> 01:08:09,290
So in summary,
I'm not going

1121
01:08:09,290 --> 01:08:11,170
to read this all to you.

1122
01:08:14,410 --> 01:08:16,830
There's quite a bit. It's

1123
01:08:16,830 --> 01:08:18,550
everything that
we talked about.

1124
01:08:19,770 --> 01:08:24,110
I put a summary of
some adverse effects

1125
01:08:24,110 --> 01:08:29,730
here of the different
drugs and vancomycin.

1126
01:08:30,130 --> 01:08:33,870
and daptomycin and
please remember

1127
01:08:33,870 --> 01:08:36,330
unnecessary outpatient

1128
01:08:36,330 --> 01:08:41,350
antibiotic use
endangers kids one

1129
01:08:41,780 --> 01:08:46,110
because of increasing
the risk of resistant

1130
01:08:46,110 --> 01:08:50,750
organisms and putting
them in harm's

1131
01:08:50,750 --> 01:08:53,870
way for adverse
effects of the drugs we

1132
01:08:53,870 --> 01:08:56,590
don't use antibiotics
unless the patient

1133
01:08:56,590 --> 01:08:59,410
has a bacterial
infection. That's it.

1134
01:08:59,590 --> 01:09:03,290
So that concludes
the two lectures

1135
01:09:03,290 --> 01:09:07,190
on this very, very,
very important

1136
01:09:07,190 --> 01:09:10,710
category of
antibiotics, the beta

1137
01:09:10,710 --> 01:09:14,690
-lactams, vancomycin,
so the glycopeptide,

1138
01:09:14,690 --> 01:09:18,950
and daptomycin,
the lipopeptide.
