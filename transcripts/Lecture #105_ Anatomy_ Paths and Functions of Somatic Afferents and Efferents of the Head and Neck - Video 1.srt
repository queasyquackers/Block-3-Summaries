Video 1. Cranial
Nerves 3, 4, and 6 This

6
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:19,110
material represents
a distillation of

7
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:20,790
information that can
be found in Moore's

8
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,210
Clinically Oriented
Anatomy, Chapters 8 and

9
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:25,570
10. For more specific
information about

10
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,630
each cranial nerve,
I recommend reading

11
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:30,050
chapter 8 and paying
close attention to

12
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:32,790
the blue boxes slash
blue pages as they

13
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,490
highlight the many
clinically relevant

14
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:37,190
aspects about this area
of cranial anatomy.

15
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,370
This lecture series
will cover 9 of the 12

16
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:42,970
cranial nerves. The
special afferents,

17
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:45,990
cranial nerves 1, 2,
and 8, will be covered

18
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:47,910
in a future lecture.
Throughout this

19
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:49,850
lecture, I will make
reference to the endocranium

20
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,050
and the skull as
separate structures.

21
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,930
The reason for
this is because the

22
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:55,810
hole a cranial
nerve uses to exit

23
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:57,690
the endocranium may
not always be the

24
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,790
same hole used to
exit the skull.

25
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,250
This will be made clearer

26
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,430
in this second video.

27
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,610
The first cranial nerve
that we will cover

28
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:07,570
today is cranial
nerve 3, oculomotor.

29
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:09,950
This is the major motor
nerve for the eye.

30
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:12,130
The oculomotor nerve
leaves the brain and

31
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:15,490
courses rostrally towards
the orbit. It runs

32
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:18,070
lateral to the cella
tercica and inside

33
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:20,290
the lateral wall of
the cavernous sinus.

34
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:23,030
The oculomotor nerve
exits the endocranium

35
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:25,810
via the superior
orbital fissure. After

36
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:28,130
exiting the endocranium,
oculomotor passes

37
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,670
through the common
tendinous ring. This

38
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,630
is where most of the
extraocular muscles

39
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:34,870
attach, and it is an
important anatomical

40
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,990
landmark for structures
within the orbit.

41
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:40,370
Past the ring, oculomotor
splits into two

42
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:43,910
major divisions, a
superior division and an

43
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:46,630
inferior division.
The superior division

44
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:49,710
innervates just two
muscles, the superior ******

45
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,590
and the levator palpebrae
superioris, a muscle

46
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,070
of the upper eyelid.
The inferior division

47
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:57,850
of oculomotor innervates
medial ******,

48
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:02,150
inferior ******, and the
inferior oblique. The

49
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:04,270
inferior division is
also responsible for

50
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:07,570
sending presynaptic
parasympathetic fibers to

51
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:10,970
the ciliary ganglion.
From this ganglion,

52
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:13,710
nerve fibers continue
into the eye as the short

53
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,210
ciliary nerves, where
they innervate the

54
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:18,990
ciliary body and sphincter
pupillae muscles.

55
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:22,110
Clinical correlate.
The multiple structures

56
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,090
innervated by oculomotor
can be used to

57
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,090
determine the location
of an oculomotor

58
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:29,150
lesion. For instance,
pitosis, or drooping

59
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,950
upper eyelid, is a
paralysis or weakness to

60
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,290
the levator palpebrae
superioris muscle.

61
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,350
Drooping eyelids
are a sign of

62
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:37,550
a lesion to the superior

63
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,650
division of the
oculomotor nerve.

64
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:42,870
In contrast, a
weakened medial ******

65
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:45,070
indicates a lesion to
the inferior division

66
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:47,110
of the nerve. A
complete lesion to

67
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:49,330
oculomotor results
in the signature down

68
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:50,910
-and-out presentation
of the affected

69
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,770
eye due to paralysis
of the four

70
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:55,330
extraocular muscles
controlled by the nerve.

71
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:58,830
Lastly, an inability
to constrict the eye

72
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:00,790
against light
suggests damage to the

73
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,950
parasympathetic fibers
traveling to the

74
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:05,030
sphincter pupillae
muscle, indicating a

75
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:07,390
potential lesion to
either the short ciliary

76
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:10,210
nerves or the ciliary
ganglion itself.

77
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:12,630
This is called anisocoria
and can best be

78
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:15,350
seen in famed rock legend
David Bowie. Moving

79
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:18,690
on to cranial nerve 4,
the trochlear nerve.

80
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:21,690
The trochlear nerve
is the smallest of our

81
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:23,670
cranial nerves and
is the only nerve to

82
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,010
leave the brain from
its dorsal surface.

83
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:28,330
All other cranial
nerves leave the

84
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:30,310
brain from the
ventral surface. From

85
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,670
the brain, the
trochlear nerve

86
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,790
follows the same path
as the oculomotor

87
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,890
nerve within the
cavernous sinus.

88
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:38,570
The trochlear nerve
passes superior

89
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:40,310
to the oculomotor
in the sinus

90
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,110
before exiting
the endocranium

91
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:44,490
through the superior
orbital fissure.

92
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,970
The trochlear nerve
innervates a single

93
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:49,890
extraocular muscle,
the superior oblique.

94
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:52,150
The superior oblique
follows a unique

95
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,090
path from the common
tendinous ring to reach

96
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:56,770
the posterolateral
aspect of the eye.

97
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:59,170
To accomplish this
feat, the muscle passes

98
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:01,950
a long tendon through
a fibrous loop that

99
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,490
juts out from the medial
wall of the orbit.

100
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,830
This loop creates
a pulley, which

101
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,810
in Latin is
called a trochlea,

102
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,110
hence where the trochlear

103
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,390
nerve gets its name.

104
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:12,610
Clinical correlate.

105
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,670
Damage to the
trochlear nerve results

106
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,430
in weakness or
paralysis of the

107
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,110
superior oblique,
affecting the

108
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:20,130
ability to look down
or even straight.

109
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:23,050
Unopposed actions from
the inferior oblique

110
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:25,030
and superior ******
cause an upward

111
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:27,770
and inward deviation
to the affected eye.

112
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:29,870
The final cranial
nerve that we will be

113
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,970
looking at in this
video is cranial nerve

114
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:35,490
6, the abducens nerve.
The abducens, or

115
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:37,530
abducent nerve, leaves
the brain near the

116
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:39,750
pons medulla junction,
where it pierces the

117
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,130
dura mater near the
clivus of the skull.

118
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:45,270
From here, the nerve
crawls its way rostrally

119
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,590
towards the cavernous
sinus, following

120
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:50,070
the same general path
as both the trochlear

121
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:52,590
and oculomotor
nerve. The abducens

122
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:55,310
nerve lies furthest
medially within the

123
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:58,090
cavernous sinus before
it exits the endocranium

124
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,490
through the superior
orbital fissure.

125
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:03,110
Within the orbit, the
abducens nerve travels

126
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:05,050
straight to the
lateral ****** muscle,

127
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:07,570
the only muscle
innervated by this nerve.

128
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:11,230
Note the AB in abducens.
The name of the

129
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:13,230
nerve is based on the
function of lateral

130
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:16,310
******, which is
to abeduct the eye.

131
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:17,650
Clinical correlate.

132
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,570
Abducens nerve
lesions present as

133
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,250
a weakness or
paralysis of the

134
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,310
corresponding lateral
****** muscle.

135
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,570
The lack of antagonistic
action against

136
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:27,730
the medial ******
results in the affected

137
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:30,490
eye turning medially
towards the nose.

138
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:33,590
Abducens palsy is the
most common palsy of

139
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,330
the nerves that we
have looked at so far.

140
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:38,130
This is due to the more
medial location of the

141
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,510
abducens nerve within
the cavernous sinus.

142
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,510
This placement puts
the nerve closest

143
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,510
to the internal
carotid artery.

144
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:46,770
Blood clots in the
cavernous sinus, or

145
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:48,510
an aneurysm of the
internal carotid

146
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,310
within the sinus,
are more likely to

147
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:52,290
compress the abducens
nerve compared to

148
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,290
the other nerves
running in the sinus.

149
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:58,120
This brings us to
the end of video 1.
