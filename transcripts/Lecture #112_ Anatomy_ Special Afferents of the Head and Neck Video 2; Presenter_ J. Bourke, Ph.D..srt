1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,580
Special Afferents of the

2
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:03,880
Head and Neck, Video 2,

3
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:06,740
Cranial Nerve 2, Vision

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,460
This is, by far,
the most important

5
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,360
special afferent
that we have.

6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,960
Around 30-60% of
our brain is devoted

7
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,060
to processing
visual information.

8
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,900
The optic nerve
is similar to

9
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,280
the olfactory
nerve in that

10
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,420
it is also not
really a nerve.

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,260
As with our
olfactory stalks,

12
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,180
the optic nerve
is actually an

13
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:31,480
anterior extension
of the brain.

14
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,660
The optic nerve travels
rostrally in the

15
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,260
anterior cranial fossa
before exiting the

16
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,540
endocranium through
the optic canal. The

17
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,160
nerve ends in a large
evagination more

18
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,000
affectionately known
as the eyeball. That's

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,480
right, our eyes are
both special afferent

20
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,500
organs and the terminal
nerves of the optic

21
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,520
nerve. The eyeball can
be divided into three

22
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,380
layers, a fibrous
layer, a vascular layer,

23
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:01,500
and a neural layer.
The fibrous layer

24
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,660
of the eye consists
of the outside of the

25
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,700
eyeball itself. This
is called the sclera.

26
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,260
Anterior to the eyeball
is a specialized

27
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,760
part of the sclera
called the cornea.

28
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,940
The anterior portion
of the eye is housed

29
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,260
within an extraocular
compartment known

30
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:20,360
as the conjunctival
layer. This compartment

31
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,680
serves to hold and
moisten the eye.

32
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,160
Both the sclera and the
cornea are comprised

33
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,120
of the same collagen
fibers. The only

34
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,560
difference is that in
the sclera, all the

35
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,300
collagen fibers are
arranged in this helter

36
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,520
-skelter pattern,
resulting in the fibers

37
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,840
blocking all incoming
lights. In the cornea,

38
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:42,100
these same fibers
are all arranged

39
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,180
parallel to each other,
allowing light to

40
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,600
pass through the
translucent fibers and

41
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,340
into the eye. The
sclera is tough,

42
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,500
protecting structures
inside the eye and

43
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,600
blocking out light
from other directions.

44
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,320
It also serves as
the distal attachment

45
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,040
for all six of the
extraocular muscles.

46
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,200
The cornea is the window
for light to enter

47
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,680
in the eye. The fibers
of the cornea are

48
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,260
misaligned just enough
to block out the high

49
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,560
energy photons such
as those from most

50
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,780
ultraviolet rays. It
also acts as the main

51
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,420
refractor of light for
the eye. More on that in

52
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,000
a minute. Blood flow to
the sclera is sparse,

53
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,980
and the cornea
itself is completely

54
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,260
avascular, relying on
capillary beds, lacrimal

55
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,580
fluids, and aqueous
humor to bring nutrients

56
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:28,160
to the cells of the
cornea. Lastly, the

57
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,380
cornea is highly sensitive
to touch. The second

58
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,740
layer of the eye is
the vascular layer.

59
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,760
This consists of
the iris, ciliary

60
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,140
body, and the
choroid. The iris is

61
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,260
the most noticeable
part of the eye.

62
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,620
It lies just
anterior to the lens.

63
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,820
It makes the
color of the eyes,

64
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,260
and it is responsible for

65
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,260
changing the size
of the pupil.

66
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,020
The iris is comprised
of two different

67
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,180
muscles that form
a ring around the

68
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,880
pupil. The innermost
portion of the iris

69
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,500
houses the
constrictor muscle for

70
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,180
the pupil, known as
sphincter pupillae.

71
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,280
This is a ring of
smooth muscle that

72
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,840
is circularly arranged
around the pupil

73
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,180
and when contracted,
will shrink the

74
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:13,000
size of the pupil. It
is parasympathetically

75
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,900
innervated.
In this image,

76
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,020
sphincter pupillae is
partially covered by

77
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,520
another muscle, the
dilator pupillae.

78
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,740
This is a ring of
radially arranged smooth

79
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,340
muscle fibers that,
when contracted,

80
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,020
pull open the eye
equally from all

81
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,480
directions, resulting
in dilation.

82
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,500
the dilator pupillae is

83
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,000
sympathetically driven.

84
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,780
Now, due to the
radial orientation of

85
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,120
the muscle fibers,
the dilator pupillae

86
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,760
takes longer to contract
than its counterpart,

87
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,760
sphincter pupillae.
Or to put it

88
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,880
another way, you can
constrict your eyes

89
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,820
a lot faster than
you can dilate them.

90
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,260
Posterior to these
muscles is a very thin

91
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,320
layer of pigmented
epithelium. Iris

92
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,860
color is determined by
the amount of melanin

93
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,460
granules produced
by melanocytes in

94
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:03,440
this pigmented
epithelium. These cells

95
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,660
produce melanin, which
gets trapped between

96
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:08,020
the fibers of the
two iris muscles.

97
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,520
The more melanin
produced, the darker the

98
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,520
eyes are. Brown eyes
carry the most melanin

99
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,160
in their pigmented
epithelium, whereas green,

100
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,060
hazel, and blue represent
decreasing amounts

101
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,720
of melanin in that
pigmented epithelial

102
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,900
layer. The iris also
serves as a landmark,

103
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,020
demarcating the
end of the anterior

104
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:30,480
compartment of the eye.
The anterior compartment

105
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,900
of the eye contains
aqueous humor, which

106
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,060
maintains pressure
inside the eye and

107
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,380
helps distribute
nutrients to the cornea.

108
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,200
The ciliary body lies
posterior to the iris.

109
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,900
It is a muscular
ring located at the

110
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:47,440
corneoscleral junction.
The ciliary body is the

111
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,440
attachment site for
the lens, and it is

112
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,480
responsible for the
production of aqueous

113
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,720
humor in the anterior
compartment of the eye.

114
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,000
The lens is attached
to the ciliary body via

115
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,740
a collection of fibers
known as zonular

116
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:05,040
fibers, or the zonule
of Zinn, which sounds

117
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,740
like a Lord of the
Rings or Game of Thrones

118
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,860
character. When the
ciliary body is at rest,

119
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:12,580
the zonular fibers are
taut and pull on the

120
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,820
lens, changing its
shape by making it

121
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:18,120
thinner and straighter.
When the ciliary body

122
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,960
contracts, the zonular
fibers loosen and the

123
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,840
lens bounces back to
its natural biconvex

124
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,700
shape. This changing of
lens shape is important

125
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,640
for accommodation,
which will be covered

126
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,200
a little later in this
video. The ciliary

127
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,100
body receives
parasympathetic innervation.

128
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,760
The final layer of
the vascular layer is

129
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,920
the choroid. It
comprises the majority of

130
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,500
the posterior compartment
of the eye and is

131
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,160
the main source of
sustenance for structures

132
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,020
inside the eyeball.
It is a dark,

133
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:53,280
reddish-brown layer. The
red in red-eye pictures

134
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,460
from cameras is the
choroid reflecting

135
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,700
back through the lens.
The choroid consists

136
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,540
of an extremely dense
mesh of capillaries

137
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:04,000
that deliver nutrient
-rich blood to the

138
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,460
retina. The choroid
is tightly attached

139
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:09,020
to the posterior part
of the retina, but

140
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:12,120
only loosely attached
to the anterior part.

141
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,460
Attachment is
maintained by pressure

142
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,920
produced by the
vitreous humor, which is

143
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,300
a gelatinous mass
that fills up most of

144
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,420
the posterior
compartment of the eye.

145
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,700
The innermost layer of
the eye is the neural

146
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,700
layer, and it consists
of the retina. The

147
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,840
retina houses around
150 million different

148
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,900
neurons, and it can be
divided into a neural

149
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:37,180
layer, again, where the
light-sensitive rods

150
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:40,080
and cones reside, and
a pigmented layer that

151
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,120
helps reduce the
scatter of light around

152
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,360
the photoreceptors of
the retina. Due to a

153
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,680
fluke of our embryology,
the neural layer of

154
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,420
the fetal retina in humans
and other vertebrates

155
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,200
differentiates
backwards. The light

156
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,180
-sensitive rods and cones
lie deep to the bipolar

157
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,820
interstitial neurons
and ganglionic cells,

158
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,660
which are in direct
line of sight of the

159
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,500
light rays. This means
light has to pass through

160
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,240
this mesh of extra,
non-light-sensitive

161
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,200
material before it hits
our photoreceptors.

162
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,900
For comparison,

163
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,880
the convergently
evolved eyes of

164
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,120
cephalopods, such as
octopus and squid, have

165
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,180
their photoreceptors
arranged the opposite

166
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,300
way, so they are
the first structures

167
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,320
to come in contact
with light rays.

168
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,040
This roundabout way
of getting light

169
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,820
information back to the
brain has produced two

170
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,000
important anatomical
structures within

171
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,880
the eye. One structure
can be seen at the

172
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,400
convergence of all the
neurons of the optic

173
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,460
nerve. This is called
the optic disc, and

174
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,520
it is so dense with
neurons that light

175
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,980
cannot effectively
********* it, resulting

176
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:45,540
in no photoreceptors
being placed there.

177
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,000
This forms a
blind spot in our

178
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,540
eye. To offset
this, our brains

179
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,340
incorporate some
post-production

180
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,640
trickery to fill
in that blind spot.

181
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,260
On the opposite
end is the macula

182
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:00,060
lutea. This is a
small depression in

183
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,360
the neural layer
formed by the sloping

184
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,800
of the non
-photoreceptor cells away

185
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,780
from the angle of
incoming light.

186
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,280
At the center of
the macula lutea,

187
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,520
the sloping of the
non-photoreceptive

188
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,300
cells produces
the most direct

189
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:16,120
access to light for
our photoreceptors,

190
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,120
resulting in the
clearest vision.

191
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,800
This area is called the

192
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,400
fovea or fovea centralis.

193
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:25,580
Here we see a
histological

194
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,260
slice through the fovea.

195
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,080
Even though most of
the non-photoreceptive

196
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,520
cells have been
pushed to the

197
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,200
side, there is still
a hefty amount of

198
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,580
non-photoreceptive
mesh to cut through

199
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,880
before reaching
these photoreceptors.

200
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:42,060
Whenever you focus
on an object, you

201
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,860
turn your eye towards
it so that the

202
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,520
image of the object
hits your fovea.

203
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,340
This behavior is
called foveation.

204
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:52,140
Both of these ocular
structures can

205
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,730
be viewed with an
ophthalmoscope.

206
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:56,600
The optic disc will
always pop out,

207
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,380
whereas the macula,
because there are

208
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,480
no blood vessels
directly in it, will

209
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,440
often look like a
faint, dark disc.

210
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,400
An important function
of the eyes is the

211
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,960
ability to change the
focal point based on where

212
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,480
an object is in three
-dimensional space.

213
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,360
This is called
accommodation.

214
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,920
To get a focused
image on the back

215
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,380
of our eyes, light
rays need to be bent

216
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,760
into focus as they
enter the eye.

217
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,020
This is done
via refraction.

218
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,420
Light refraction in
the eye is a two-part

219
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,560
process that starts
when light passes

220
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,700
through the cornea. The
cornea is the largest

221
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,120
contributor to
refraction in the eye.

222
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,000
It is responsible
for two-thirds of the

223
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,760
bending of light rays
to focus an image.

224
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:42,380
The remaining one
-third comes from the

225
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,940
lens, which fine
-tunes the image to

226
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,360
hit the back of the
eyes just right.

227
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,340
The lens by itself is

228
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,040
spherical and elastic.

229
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,200
To adjust the
focal point of the

230
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,300
eyes, the lens
must be deformed.

231
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,600
Objects that are far
away reflect parallel

232
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,580
light rays. To focus
on them, the lens needs

233
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:04,020
to be stretched and
made thinner. This

234
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,600
reduces its refractive
power, allowing only

235
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,340
for a slight bend to
incoming light rays.

236
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,160
This action is
largely done passively

237
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,260
as the tension of
the zonular fibers

238
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,900
pulls on the lens,
thinning it out.

239
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,140
Objects that are close
to the eye reflect

240
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:23,280
divergent light rays,
requiring a wider lens

241
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,200
to more strongly bend
the light into focus.

242
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,940
This is an active
process from our eyes,

243
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,880
as parasympathetic
innervation from the

244
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,300
oculomotor nerve,
via the short ciliary

245
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,640
nerves, is required
to stimulate

246
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,620
contraction of the
ciliary body and loosen

247
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:41,500
the zonular fibers,
allowing the lens to

248
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,120
return to its normal,
spherical shape.

249
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,780
And this is
the part where

250
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:46,780
it gets counterintuitive.

251
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,740
Because the act
of changing the

252
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,980
lens shape is
a passive one.

253
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,260
No nerve stimulation
is required to

254
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,340
focus on objects
in the distance.

255
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:00,320
In contrast,
returning the lens to

256
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,120
its normal spherical
shape requires

257
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,420
the eye to contract
the ciliary body

258
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,840
and loosen those
zonular fibers.

259
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,420
This is why our
eyes get tired

260
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,440
after reading or
staring at a screen

261
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,540
for a long time.
the ciliary body

262
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,480
has been contracted
for too long.

263
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:19,520
Since light typically
travels in a straight

264
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,680
line and the retina
covers the entire

265
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,020
back half of our
spherical eye, our retina

266
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,540
and vision are actually
broken into two

267
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,940
hemispheres per eye.
The retina is divided

268
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,660
into a temporal
hemiretina that covers

269
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,860
the side of the eye
closest to the temporal

270
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,680
bones and a nasal
hemiretina that covers

271
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,840
the side of the eye
closest to the nose.

272
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,100
This divides our
visual field into a

273
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,480
temporal visual field
that covers the half

274
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,320
of our vision closest
to the side of

275
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,100
our face, and a nasal
visual field that

276
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,040
covers light rays
coming closer to the

277
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,320
nose. You will go
into much more detail

278
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,560
on vision later
during neuroanatomy.

279
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,960
For now, the big takeaway
from this picture

280
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,600
is that each hemiretina
receives light

281
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,180
input from the opposite
visual field. For

282
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:11,480
example, the nasal visual
field will send light

283
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,320
rays to the temporal
hemiretina, and vice

284
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,420
versa. If you find
yourself confused by

285
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:20,340
this, remember to view
light rays as traveling

286
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:23,440
in straight lines, and
just draw a straight

287
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,560
line into the eye
from any visual angle.

288
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,180
Neurons from each
hemiretina travel

289
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:31,340
back to the brain
differently. While

290
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,540
all the optic neurons
pass through this

291
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,860
junction, called
the optic chiasm,

292
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,220
only the neurons
from our nasal

293
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:41,360
hemiretinas cross
over, or decasate,

294
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,460
at the chiasm,
and then travel to

295
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:45,720
the contralateral
side of the brain.

296
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,500
Again, this is a
relatively brief summary

297
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,560
of vision. You will
learn much more

298
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,020
about this in neuroanatomy
next semester.

299
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:56,940
Clinical correlate.
As our most important

300
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,380
special sense, there
are no shortage of

301
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:02,200
clinical correlates for
vision. By far the most

302
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,640
common is simply the
effects of age. As

303
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:08,360
we age, our lenses
lose their elasticity,

304
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,620
making it harder for
the lens to bounce back

305
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:13,460
to its original,
spherical shape, which is

306
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,020
necessary for looking
at close-up objects.

307
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,940
Even though we use
muscular contraction to

308
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,520
look at objects that are
close up, the contraction

309
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,800
only loosens the
attachments of the

310
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,500
zonular fibers. There is
no way for our body to

311
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,820
force our lens to
return to its original

312
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,920
shape once that elasticity
has started to go.

313
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,000
We've all seen
parents, grandparents,

314
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,280
and professors do
the pull-object

315
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,180
-away-from-face
technique to read the

316
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:43,700
words. This is a
behavioral adjustment

317
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,600
for the reduced
close-up vision.

318
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:48,080
Treatment is
typically glasses or

319
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,580
contacts, with the
relatively new ability

320
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,760
to use multifocal
presbylasic as a way

321
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,780
to change the
cornea's refractive

322
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:58,460
ability to accommodate
the stiffer lens.

323
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,780
As with the rest
of the body,

324
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,720
the lens is
comprised of cells.

325
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,320
Normal wear and tear
causes the breakdown of

326
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,960
proteins in these cells.
As we age, the rate

327
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,280
of repair to these
denatured proteins starts

328
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,920
to diminish, resulting
in the lens thickening

329
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,320
with what amounts
to cellular garbage.

330
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,580
Eventually, this
thickening can lead

331
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:21,720
to a cloudiness
called a cataract. If

332
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,320
left untreated,
the cataract will

333
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,680
eventually cause
blindness as it diffuses

334
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,100
more and more light
across the retina.

335
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,840
Cataracts can be
exacerbated by other

336
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,340
underlying
problems such as

337
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:35,240
hypertension, poor
nutrition, and smoking.

338
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,080
Cataracts also have
a strong genetic

339
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,620
component to them
and can be brought

340
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,800
on by other congenital
disorders such

341
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,420
as Down syndrome or
Turner's syndrome.

342
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:47,620
In all cases, cataracts
require surgical

343
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,840
intervention to fix.
This is usually done via

344
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,180
a partial or total lens
replacement depending

345
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,500
on the degree of
cataract cloudiness.

346
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:58,420
In a healthy person,
aqueous humor is

347
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,080
continuously produced
by the ciliary

348
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,560
body and distributed
across the anterior

349
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,400
chamber of the
eye where it will

350
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,000
drain from the
scleral venous sinus,

351
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,300
which is otherwise known

352
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,240
as the canal of Schlem.

353
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,860
Aqueous humor is
important for proper

354
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,620
nutrition to the
cornea, and when that

355
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,680
flow pattern gets
blocked, the humor can

356
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,060
start to stagnate
and become cloudy.

357
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,980
This cloudiness is
called glaucoma,

358
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,620
and it's usually
caused by a

359
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,760
blockage of that
drainage system.

360
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,720
There are two common
forms of glaucoma.

361
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,540
Open-angled glaucoma
has the scleral venous

362
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,540
sinus blocked by some
of the trabecular

363
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,540
meshwork comprising
the canal itself.

364
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,840
This can lead to a
slow-forming glaucoma.

365
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,480
The second form
is called closed

366
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,860
-angle glaucoma,
and it is caused by

367
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,960
the angle between
the iris and scleral

368
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,940
venous sinus
being too acute.

369
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:50,880
blocking access to
the canal entirely.

370
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,860
Closed angle glaucoma
is usually more of

371
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:56,180
a medical emergency
than open angle as

372
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,380
the pressure buildup
happens a lot faster.

373
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,640
Finally, we have
retinal detachment.

374
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,300
Remember that the
retina forms two layers,

375
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:07,000
a pigmented layer
next to and tightly

376
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,440
adhered to the choroid,
and a neural layer

377
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,340
that has the
photoreceptors on it. The

378
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,780
neural layer is not
tightly adhered and

379
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:18,020
requires constant
pressure from the aqueous

380
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,500
and vitreous humor
to maintain contact

381
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,820
with the capillary
bed of the choroid.

382
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,600
Any type of eye
damage that reduces

383
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,820
intraocular pressure
puts the retina at risk.

384
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,020
Patients who suffer
retinal detachment

385
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,200
complain of flashes
of light or of

386
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,540
constant specks of
light in their vision.

387
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,080
Retinal detachment is
considered a medical

388
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,060
emergency as the
neural layer of the

389
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,520
retina is very
intolerant of hypoxia

390
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,040
and cell death can
happen very quickly.

391
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:49,140
This brings us to
the end of video two.
