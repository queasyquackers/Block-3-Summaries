Hearing and Balance.

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,420
The vestibulocochlear
nerve comes off the

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,500
pond's medulla junction
and follows the

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,840
facial nerve out of
the endocranium via

7
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,040
the internal acoustic
meatus. The nerve

8
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,920
starts as a single
structure leaving the

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,060
brain, but it quickly
splits into two

10
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,440
nerves as it reaches
its destination within

11
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,740
the inner ear. These
two nerves are the

12
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:32,560
vestibular nerve and
the cochlear nerve.

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,580
The vestibular nerve
handles the vestibular

14
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,040
system, the area
associated with balance,

15
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,520
whereas the cochlear
nerve covers the

16
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,600
cochlea, which is
the organ of hearing.

17
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,800
Although both vestibulocochlear
and facial enter

18
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,480
the internal acoustic
meatus, only the

19
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,100
facial nerve exits
the skull. The

20
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,860
vestibulocochlear nerve
only goes as far as the

21
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:57,340
inner ear. The nerve
splits into finer nerves

22
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,540
that receive sensory
information from a

23
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:02,420
specialized organ
called the otic capsule.

24
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,560
The otic capsule
consists of a bony or

25
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,780
endosseous labyrinth.
This is a set of cavities

26
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,160
filled with a fluid
called perilymph.

27
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:14,040
Perilymph has a
consistency similar to

28
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,100
most extracellular
fluids. Just deep to

29
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,180
the perilymph covered
endosteous labyrinth

30
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,200
is a secondary
structure called the

31
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,880
membranous labyrinth.
This is where the

32
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,340
hearing and balance
organs really function.

33
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,180
The membranous
labyrinth is filled

34
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,180
with endolymph, a
positively charged

35
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,220
substance similar to
intracellular fluid.

36
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,900
The membranous
labyrinth can be divided

37
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,720
into the vestibular
organ and the cochlea.

38
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,080
The vestibular organ
provides our sense

39
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,860
of balance and direction.
It is comprised

40
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,040
of two different
structures, the

41
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,120
otolith organs and the
semicircular canals.

42
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:52,260
There are two
otolith organs,

43
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,800
the utricle and the
saccule. They are

44
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,740
responsible for
detecting change in

45
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:01,020
direction. They do
this via two expansions

46
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,960
of the bony labyrinth
that house many

47
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,180
small calcifications
called otoliths.

48
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,820
Otolith, literally
translated,

49
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,100
means ear rock.
These little

50
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,160
calcifications give
weight to the gelatin

51
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,580
inside the saccule
and utricle.

52
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,600
Embedded within
that jelly are

53
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,740
the cilia of
sensory neurons.

54
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,760
The utricle is aligned
horizontally in

55
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,960
the head with the
sensory neurons placed

56
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,560
along the floor of
the utricle in an area

57
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,720
called the macula.
This lets the utricle

58
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,240
act as a horizontal
acceleration sensor,

59
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,680
letting us know
where our head is in

60
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,840
space. Data from the
utricle is compared to

61
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,800
semicircular canal
data to further

62
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,960
determine where our head
is oriented. We will

63
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,120
cover the semicircular
canals in a bit.

64
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,740
The saccule has a
similar construction

65
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:51,120
as the utricle,
but it is placed on

66
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,280
the medial wall
of the vestibular

67
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,040
organ. The saccule
detects vertical

68
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,540
motion and acts as
our gravity sensor.

69
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,160
Lastly, we have the
semicircular canals.

70
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,460
These provide
information on head

71
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:07,700
tilt and position
in space. We have

72
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:11,020
three semicircular
canals, the anterior,

73
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:14,700
posterior, and lateral
semicircular canal.

74
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,220
The anatomy of all three
canals is the same.

75
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,260
Each canal is filled
with endolymph, and

76
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:24,240
each canal ends in an
expanded section called

77
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,280
the ampulla. Inside
the ampulla resides

78
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,180
the ampullary crests,
or crista ampullari.

79
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,240
These crests protrude
into the membranous

80
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,920
labyrinth and house
multiple stereocilia

81
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,660
attached to sensory
neurons. Each semicircular

82
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:42,220
canal works as a pair
with a semicircular

83
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,560
canal from the other
side of the head.

84
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,560
This allows us to
accurately determine our

85
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,420
head rotation and
orientation in space.

86
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,040
The three opposing
pairs of semicircular

87
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,040
canals are the left
and right horizontal,

88
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,640
the right anterior
and left posterior,

89
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,140
and the left anterior and

90
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:06,020
right posterior
semicircular canals.

91
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,400
As the head rotates
in space, these three

92
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,820
semicircular
canals switch their

93
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,320
endolymphatic fluid
around, pushing on the

94
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,780
ampullary crests and
bending them one way

95
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:19,440
or the other. This
bending causes

96
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,500
depolarization of afferent
neurons on the side

97
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,660
that the head is
turning towards, while

98
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,260
hyperpolarizing,
or inhibiting, the

99
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:30,080
aferrit neurons on the
contralateral side.

100
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:33,260
This asymmetric
firing of neurons

101
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,660
allows the brain
to determine

102
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,460
which way the
head is turning.

103
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,920
These movements can

104
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,500
seem confusing at first.

105
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,180
The key part to
remember is that your

106
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,760
brain is just measuring
the difference in

107
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,150
signal intensity
between the paired

108
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:51,180
semicircular canals in your
head. So, for instance,

109
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,480
if you turn your
head to the left,

110
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,860
then your left
horizontal semicircular

111
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,860
canal would increase
signal intensity, whereas

112
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,200
your right horizontal
semicircular

113
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,120
canal would decrease
its signal intensity.

114
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,440
The second portion of the

115
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,420
otic capsule
is the cochlea.

116
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,040
Cochlea means
spiral, and it earned

117
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,480
its name from
the snail shell

118
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,340
shape that it
takes in the ear.

119
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,320
As part of our
hearing system,

120
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,880
the cochlea sends all its

121
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,720
information to the
cochlear nerve.

122
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,360
Inside the cochlea,
the membranous

123
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,100
labyrinth continues as
the spiral ligament,

124
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,540
and within the
spiral ligament is

125
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:30,160
the endolymph-filled
cochlear duct.

126
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,880
The walls of the spiral
ligament create a

127
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,000
barrier that separates
the rest of the

128
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,220
endosseous labyrinth
into two channels, the

129
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:41,400
perilymph-filled scala
vestibuli and scala

130
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,420
tympani. To understand
how sound travels

131
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,360
through the cochlea,
we have to start in

132
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,400
the middle ear. At the
tympanum, sound waves

133
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,760
shake the tympanic
membrane, transmitting

134
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,640
those sound waves
to the attached ear

135
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:57,900
ossicles, the malleus,
incus, and stapes. It

136
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,680
is at the footplate
of the stapes that

137
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,140
the sound waves reach
the cochlea. The

138
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:04,820
footplate of the stapes
taps on a special window

139
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,380
on the cochlea called
the oval window.

140
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:11,040
This sends a pressure
wave into the perilymph

141
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,020
of the endosseous
labyrinth through the

142
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:16,100
scala vestibulae. This
pressure wave distorts

143
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,540
the cochlear duct,
stimulating afferent

144
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,960
neurons placed in a
specialized region of

145
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,180
the duct called the
organ of corti. This

146
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,560
structure houses sensory
neurons with cilia

147
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,500
encased in jelly similar
to the otolith organs

148
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,880
and the ampullary crests
of the semicircular

149
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,900
canals. These
neurons depolarize at

150
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,060
different harmonic
frequencies, sending their

151
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,280
information back to
the brain via the

152
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,060
cochlear nerve. That
pressure wave is then

153
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,220
translated to the other
channel, the scala

154
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,920
tympani, where its energy
is eventually released

155
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,340
through the round
window of the cochlea.

156
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:52,120
This is all a very
basic rundown of

157
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,120
sound transduction,
which you will learn

158
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,840
more about in
neuroanatomy. The

159
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,000
frequency of sound waves
entering the middle

160
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,260
ear determine how
far up the spiral

161
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,980
cochlea that sound
wave will go. Lower

162
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:06,240
sounds travel further
up the spiral.

163
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,480
Due to the large size
difference between our

164
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,700
tympanic membrane and
the footplate of the

165
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,840
stapes, all sounds get
naturally amplified

166
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,680
on their way to the
cochlea. To keep from

167
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,240
destroying the cochlear
membrane with very loud

168
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,040
sounds, we have two
built-in safeties. Those

169
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,280
two little ear muscles
we talked about in

170
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,920
the previous lecture
series, tensor tympani

171
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:32,640
and stapedius. These
little muscles lock down

172
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,620
the ear ossicles and
dull incoming sounds.

173
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,260
Clinical correlate.

174
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:40,180
Hearing loss is,
of course, the most

175
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,560
common clinical case
associated with the

176
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,560
vestibulocochlear
nerve and the ear.

177
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,740
Hearing loss can be
congenital, or it can

178
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,700
be acquired from
being around very loud

179
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,140
noises for an extended
period of time.

180
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,480
Hearing loss can
be divided into

181
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,520
two types, conductive
hearing loss

182
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,940
and sensorineural
hearing loss.

183
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,520
Conductive hearing
loss affects the

184
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,220
middle ear and is a
problem with either

185
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,260
the tympanum or
the ear ossicles.

186
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:09,280
A perforated tympanic
membrane or scarring

187
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,360
around the ear
ossicles caused by an

188
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,240
untreated case of
otitis media can result

189
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,600
in dulled sounds
reaching the cochlea.

190
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:19,300
People with conductive
hearing loss typically

191
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,680
speak quieter than
normal as they hear

192
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,860
their own voice louder
than anything around

193
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:26,260
them. This type of
hearing loss can be

194
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,600
treated surgically or
with a hearing aid.

195
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,840
Sensory neural hearing
loss is another matter

196
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,360
entirely. It is a
problem with the inner

197
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,600
ear and can include
the loss of the sensory

198
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,240
hair cells in the
cochlea, or it can

199
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,540
incorporate the cochlear
nerve itself and any

200
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:44,040
of its relays along
the way to the brain.

201
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,520
Treatments require
cochlear implants. However,

202
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,620
even these implants
produce only crude

203
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,020
improvements compared
to natural hearing.

204
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,360
Tinnitus is by far the
most common hearing

205
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,620
problem, affecting
some 15-20% of the

206
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,140
U.S. population. It
is associated with

207
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,460
aging as hair cells
from higher frequency

208
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,780
regions of the cochlea
start disappearing.

209
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,440
The result is a
ringing sensation

210
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,620
in the ear whenever the

211
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,680
brain checks on
that frequency.

212
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,880
Tinnitus is not
actually a disease, but

213
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,420
instead is a symptom
of a larger problem.

214
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,060
Tinnitus can be acquired
earlier in life by

215
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,680
people living or working
in very loud areas.

216
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,520
The ringing is
constant and typically

217
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,140
does not require an
outside stimulus.

218
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,120
The rates of tinnitus
and sensorineural

219
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,100
hearing loss have
been on the rise

220
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,360
as an entire
generation has grown up

221
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,400
listening to music
through earbuds.

222
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,160
There has been
roughly a 30% increase

223
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,320
in hearing loss among
young adults over

224
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,740
the past 20 years.
The underlying problem

225
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:48,000
is that most
earbuds don't form a

226
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,240
tight seal around
the external auditory

227
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,760
meatus, resulting
in sound leaking out

228
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,840
into the world and
making sounds coming

229
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,500
from those earbuds
appear too quiet.

230
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,440
The response to this
is often to raise

231
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,620
the volume to a listenable
level, resulting

232
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,400
in high decibel
sound waves hitting

233
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,780
the ear for extended
periods of time.

234
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:11,220
The vestibular system
is not immune to

235
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:14,120
pathologies either. A
common pathology for the

236
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,640
vestibular system
is benign paroxysmal

237
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,880
position vertigo. This
pathology is caused when

238
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:23,360
otoliths break free
from the utricle. These

239
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,760
otoliths find their
way into one of the

240
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,180
semicircular canals,
where they push against

241
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,540
the ampullary crests,
producing conflicting

242
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:33,040
signals about head
position to the brain.

243
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,580
There are multiple
causes behind

244
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:38,780
BPPV, ranging from
head trauma to age

245
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,560
-related tissue
weakening to the most

246
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,900
common reason that
it just happens.

247
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,880
Patients with BPPV
experience intense

248
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,540
and debilitating
dizziness and nausea.

249
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,800
The effect can
last for minutes to

250
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,680
days and, in really
bad cases, months.

251
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:59,420
Most cases of BPPV
resolve themselves over

252
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:02,000
time as the free
-floating otoliths are

253
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,680
broken down and
reabsorbed by the body.

254
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,020
There are treatment
options that

255
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,940
can speed up this
process, such as

256
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,720
canolith
repositioning, which is

257
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,720
otherwise known as
the Epley maneuver.

258
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,980
This technique helps
to move the rogue

259
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:18,460
otoliths out of the
offending semicircular

260
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,760
canal and back into
the vestibule, where

261
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,780
they won't cause
vertigo and will get

262
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:26,300
reabsorbed faster. In
extreme cases, surgery

263
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,260
may be required
to free an otolith

264
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,680
that has gotten hung
up on a nerve bundle.

265
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:34,220
As with olfaction
and gustation,

266
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,200
the eyes and
vestibular system are

267
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,720
another instance
of a coupled

268
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,820
sense, the vestibulo
-ocular reflex.

269
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,480
This reflex is
necessary for

270
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,080
proper gaze
stabilization.

271
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,780
We are moving our
heads and bodies around

272
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:50,700
constantly. If our
eyes did not compensate

273
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,980
for the rotation
of our heads, the

274
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,000
world would look like
a bad found footage

275
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,320
movie. The vestibulo
-ocular reflex

276
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,800
uses information relayed
from the vestibular

277
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,940
system through the
vestibular nerve.

278
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,900
Balance information
passes through several

279
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,900
different nuclei
in the brain before

280
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,360
reaching the motor
nerves for the eyes.

281
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,720
These motor nerves
activate the appropriate

282
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,020
extraocular muscles
for each eye,

283
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,620
allowing our eyes to
compensate for the

284
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:20,180
jittery movements of
our heads and bodies,

285
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:22,600
and keeping our view
of the world stable.

286
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:25,000
You can test this
for yourself by

287
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,400
holding an object
in front of your

288
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,160
face and rotating
your head around

289
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,400
while focusing
on that object.

290
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,480
However, to really see
the vestibulo-ocular

291
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,620
reflex in motion, we
need to turn to birds.

292
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:39,660
Bird eyes are so large
relative to their

293
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,920
skull that the
extraocular muscles are

294
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,880
not able to do much
to adjust the eyes.

295
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,260
Birds compensate
for their lack

296
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,920
of eye movement
by turning their

297
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,760
entire heads to
see something.

298
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:54,080
To maintain gaze
stabilization, the vestibulo

299
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,460
-ocular reflex of birds
incorporates their

300
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:59,120
neck muscles, allowing
their extremely flexible

301
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,760
necks to act the same
way our extra-ocular

302
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,000
muscles act, leading
to this wonderful

303
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,500
example from a 2013
Mercedes-Benz commercial.

304
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:13,760
Clinical Coralip A
delay in the vestibulo

305
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,940
-ocular reflex
produces nystagmus,

306
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:18,380
or an unwanted
saccade of the eyes as

307
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,060
they attempt to
adjust to delayed

308
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,100
information from the
vestibular system.

309
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,060
Nystagmus can be
acquired through

310
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,900
alcohol and
heavy drug use.

311
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,920
Nystagmus is a
common symptom

312
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,620
looked for by
police when testing

313
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,610
to see if someone
is intoxicated.

314
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,580
Nystagmus can also be

315
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,960
acquired congenitally.

316
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,900
The majority of
nystagmus cases are

317
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,820
benign and do not
require medical

318
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,860
intervention. In
rare instances of

319
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,240
persistent debilitating
nystagmus, a

320
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,460
pharmacological
treatment can be offered.

321
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:50,180
This brings us
to the end of the

322
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:53,240
lecture and the
end of video 3.
