of our discussion of
health disparities,

12
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,060
Closing the Gap Through
Cultural Competencies.

13
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:39,040
In the second segment
of this presentation,

14
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,520
we will be
defining, at the end

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,680
of this presentation,
you should be

16
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,220
able to define
and explain the

17
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:46,100
frameworks of
cultural competency.

18
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,200
Explain the
role of cultural

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,200
beliefs in
influencing health.

20
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,400
Explain the role of
cultural competence

21
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,680
and humility in
addressing the

22
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,220
disparity gaps in
healthcare. care.

23
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,900
Before we take
a deep dive into

24
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:18,300
cultural competency,
let's take a

25
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:22,220
moment to define
what is culture.

26
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,320
Culture is considered
a central concept in

27
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,480
the study of anthropology
and sociology.

28
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,240
It encompasses a range
of phenomenas that

29
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,720
are transmitted
through social learning

30
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,700
in human societies
it reflects the

31
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,660
whole of human behavior
including ideas

32
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:46,840
attitudes ways to
relate to one another

33
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,830
manners of speaking
or expression systems

34
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,120
of belief etiquette law
morals entertainment

35
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,160
and education
that are commonly

36
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,780
shared among members
of a particular group

37
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,780
Something to keep in mind
is that any individual

38
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:11,140
can identify with
one or more culture.

39
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:18,650
Also something to keep
in mind is that culture

40
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:22,510
is not necessarily
synonymous with race.

41
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:36,830
So what is cultural
competency?

42
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:38,610
Well, first,
let's start with

43
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:41,570
what is not
cultural competency.

44
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:46,790
Cultural competency
is not being really

45
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:49,890
polite, although you
should be. but even

46
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:53,130
a very polite and
well-mannered, well

47
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:57,030
-intended individual
may lack cultural

48
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,970
competency. So just
something to keep in

49
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:02,290
mind is that we're
not equating manners

50
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:06,630
and politeness to
cultural competencies.

51
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:10,650
Also, cultural
competency is not just

52
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,810
because, not just about
being able to speak a

53
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:16,510
person's language that
connection actually

54
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:19,810
can help but even
if you do speak the

55
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:23,410
language or understand
the language of another

56
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:27,490
group of people does
not necessarily mean

57
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:30,330
that the individual
or you may have

58
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:34,930
competencies related to
cultural competencies

59
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,530
another thing that
culture competency

60
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:43,830
isn't is um it isn't
about knowing the

61
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:48,770
stereotypes of different
cultures um there

62
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:52,270
is a strong temptation
to put a broad

63
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:56,410
brushstroke of
different people groups

64
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:59,210
it's something that's
done very often

65
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:02,590
and even within our
own western culture,

66
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,450
things that we may
hear or experience.

67
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:08,410
But it's very important
not to come in

68
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:15,130
resting and relying
or depending on these

69
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:18,770
learned stereotypes
of different cultures.

70
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:23,430
This can be hazardous,
certainly if

71
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:27,150
misappropriated, and also
does not show a posture

72
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:30,910
of someone who's learning
and understanding

73
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:34,470
that not everyone
in a specific people

74
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:37,630
group adhere to all
of the norms within

75
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:40,240
that people group. So
it's one, it's very

76
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,730
important. These are
common things that I

77
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:44,110
often come up with. This
is not an exhaustive

78
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,870
list when we talk
about cultural

79
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:48,270
competency, but these
are things certainly to

80
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:50,490
keep, some of the
things to keep in mind.

81
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:54,870
The definition of
cultural competency will

82
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:57,290
be adopting from the
NIH and essentially

83
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:00,410
cultural competency
positively impacts care

84
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:03,650
through service delivery
that is respectful

85
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:06,350
of and responsive
to the health belief

86
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:09,950
practices cultural
and linguistic

87
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:12,530
needs of diverse patients

88
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:18,070
it's understanding
it's adapting

89
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:20,850
and being responsive
to individuals

90
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:23,450
from other cultures
with different

91
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:25,290
belief systems
than your own.

92
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:28,370
The ability of
health professionals

93
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,090
to communicate and
effectively provide

94
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:34,250
high-quality care
to patients from

95
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,410
diverse sociocultural
backgrounds.

96
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:43,970
In this discipline of
cultural competency,

97
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:46,830
there have been
some emerging terms.

98
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:50,810
A term called cultural
competability.

99
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:57,430
um what this term
aims to do is to

100
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:01,010
reconcile the relationship
between cultural

101
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:04,650
competency and
cultural humility and

102
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:07,410
here's why in this
discipline of cultural

103
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:10,630
competency there's
been a critique that

104
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:13,990
this term cultural
competency can be seen

105
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:17,170
as acquiring a technical
skill, something

106
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:19,630
that is to be
mastered. And there

107
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:23,150
is a strong potential
of reinforcing and

108
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:26,710
adhering to
stereotypes, and that it

109
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:30,610
really does not
genuinely address the

110
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:33,210
issues and underlying
issues of inequities

111
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:35,450
or social justice.
So those are

112
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:37,210
some of the critiques
in the discipline.

113
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:42,130
Uh, cultural humility
has been, um,

114
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:44,070
uh, a word, a
term that's been

115
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,410
used that talks
about, um,

116
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:49,870
uh, dynamic
and a lifelong

117
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:52,390
process of focusing
on self-reflection

118
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:54,430
and personal
critique, uh,

119
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:59,250
in the area of
learning and, and, um,

120
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:00,810
understanding others.

121
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,890
So while we may not use

122
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,450
cultural competability

123
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:10,030
throughout this
entire presentation,

124
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,030
I just wanted you
to be aware of

125
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,370
some of these
emerging terms as

126
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,490
you may be desiring
to learn more

127
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:17,330
and go deeper into
the literature.

128
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:20,470
You may see these
terms. For the sake

129
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:22,470
of this presentation,
we'll be using

130
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,770
the word cultural
competency, but

131
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:27,570
being aware of
these contingencies,

132
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:30,130
that this is not something
that is necessarily

133
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:34,090
mastered because we
can never understand

134
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:36,010
and learn all of
the cultures in the

135
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:40,090
globe, but it really
is a posture of, um,

136
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:43,790
and of, of continual
lifelong commitment

137
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:46,530
to understanding the
lived experiences

138
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:49,710
of people that requires
self-reflection

139
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:52,590
and personal critique
and so i just wanted

140
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:58,120
to make this these
definitions um clearer

141
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:00,770
to you and even
just hold attention

142
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:02,610
for some of these
definitions because this

143
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:06,750
is a very dynamic
topic and discussion

144
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:12,910
this is a venn diagram
of the process of

145
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,950
cultural competency
and i like the word

146
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:17,590
process of cultural
competency, because

147
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:19,970
indeed it is. It's a
lifelong commitment, as

148
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:23,870
I noted before. This
process of cultural

149
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:26,910
competency requires
cultural awareness,

150
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,370
cultural knowledge,

151
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:31,810
cultural skill,

152
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:38,010
cultural encounters,
and cultural desire.

153
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:41,650
And these five elements

154
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:44,810
overlapping one
another is the

155
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:47,150
place where you'll
see a process, the

156
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:49,650
process of cultural
competency.

157
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:57,050
In the area of cultural
awareness, one of

158
00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:00,230
the areas of the Venn
diagram, it's the place

159
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:03,770
of self-examination.
It's in-depth exploration

160
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:06,910
of your own cultural
and professional

161
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:10,870
background, recognition
of your own biases,

162
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:13,790
assumptions, or
prejudices. So the more

163
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:16,570
you, um, have in a
greater awareness of

164
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:21,670
yourself, um, awareness
of what you carry into

165
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:24,010
a conversation with
people or different

166
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:28,410
types of people, the
more you are engaging

167
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:31,630
in this process of
cultural competency.

168
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,650
The next area that
was in that Venn

169
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,390
diagram was cultural
knowledge. And

170
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:40,250
that's the process of
seeking and obtaining

171
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:44,210
sound educational
foundation about

172
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:46,530
diverse cultural
and ethnic groups.

173
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:50,370
Intracultural
variation is the

174
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:53,550
avoiding of stereotypes
and understanding

175
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:56,050
that everyone in
a culture adhere

176
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:59,210
to various degrees
of the culture.

177
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,750
So it's always important
to keep in mind

178
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:07,830
that when you're
having any inquiries,

179
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:10,350
that is important
specifically to the medical

180
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,650
care of the patient
you'll be caring

181
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:16,070
for is that it's
important just to ask and

182
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:18,020
to explain why you're
asking questions

183
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:21,110
pertaining to their
culture that may have

184
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:23,790
an impact on their
health outcome to get

185
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,850
a better understanding
of what degree does

186
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:29,150
this individual adhere
to their culture

187
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:33,230
the next area
in that previous

188
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:35,410
venn diagram was
cultural knowledge

189
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:38,350
The clinician must
be able to integrate

190
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:41,270
health-related beliefs
and cultural values in

191
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:43,710
the care of the patient,
understanding what

192
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:46,930
is important, what is
the driving why for

193
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:50,910
the patient, what are
the perspectives and

194
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:55,090
worldviews that influence
the behavior, the

195
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:57,230
health, and the
understanding of the patient

196
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:00,710
is vital, regardless
of how well a physician

197
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:03,670
is able to manage
high blood pressure, a

198
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:06,170
heart attack, a ******,
or any other chronic

199
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:08,790
or acute illness. But
if they're able to

200
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:13,910
inquire thoughtfully,
respectfully, the

201
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:17,050
understanding of what
is important in terms of

202
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:20,010
values of the patient,
it will allow you to

203
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:23,910
provide a customized
care for this patient.

204
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:27,990
The clinician must
be able to integrate

205
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:30,790
disease incidence
and prevalence.

206
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:34,450
So essentially,
being aware of

207
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:37,710
prevalence of
illness in people

208
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:40,470
groups actually
is helpful,

209
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:44,330
not assuming that all
people may have an

210
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:47,850
illness, but to have
an awareness that there

211
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:50,010
is a prevalence. For
instance, in the previous

212
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:54,470
presentation, we talked
about the maternal

213
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:57,730
and infant health,
particularly in

214
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:00,770
minority population.
And because we are aware

215
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:03,510
of that data, there's
a certain level of

216
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:06,770
awareness that we bring
into these encounters

217
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:10,790
so that we can be
present a certain level

218
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:13,850
of thoughtfulness when
we're providing care.

219
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:17,970
And also the efficacy
of treatment is

220
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:21,310
important. If you're
not aware about how the

221
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:26,970
culture of an individual
responds to how um,

222
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:29,390
the culture of an
individual, um,

223
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:32,090
um, sees the
treatment that you're

224
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:33,970
offering, it may not be

225
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:36,190
effective. It may
not be effective.

226
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:39,850
The other area in
that Venn diagram was

227
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:41,950
cultural, cultural skill.
And essentially that's

228
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:44,430
the ability to collect
relevant cultural

229
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,690
data regarding the patient's
presenting problem,

230
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:49,150
as well as accurately
performing physical

231
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:54,330
assessment in cultural
contexts in mind. So

232
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:57,330
the collection of
cultural data, as you're

233
00:12:57,330 --> 00:13:00,470
learning more about
your patient, if it is

234
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:04,730
certainly relevant to
the care of your patient,

235
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:07,210
if they're telling
you where their family

236
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:10,750
is from, what are the
meals that they eat,

237
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:14,730
what are the activities
they participate in.

238
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:17,470
Those things can be
really helpful to

239
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:21,230
understand the context
of the mind of your

240
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:23,910
patient, right? Who's
important in their family

241
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:26,930
unit that they must
include in their care.

242
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:29,310
Not everyone that
you're going to see may

243
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:32,770
have a Western mindset
in the way that, um,

244
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,350
and Western mindset
in the way that we

245
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:38,630
think about healthcare.
Perhaps you're engaging

246
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:40,550
with an individual
where the family

247
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:44,270
unit is considered in
decision making. And

248
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:46,070
so there are ways
that you have to learn

249
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:49,090
how to navigate that
perspective to provide

250
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:51,470
care, not only for
that individual, but

251
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,790
because that individual
invites other family

252
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,450
members, how to
help to have them

253
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:57,890
participate in those
decision making as well.

254
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:03,570
Also in the process,
again, the process of

255
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:06,890
cultural competency are
cultural encounters.

256
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:11,010
You must encounter
with people who are not

257
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:13,970
like you. You must
engage. You will engage

258
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:16,070
with people who are not
like you, most likely.

259
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:18,470
But if you find yourself
that you're not,

260
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:21,870
putting yourself in that
position will actually

261
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:24,290
help you in your
lifelong commitment to

262
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:27,250
do so. This process
encourages healthcare

263
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:30,010
professionals to
directly engage in cross

264
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:31,910
-cultural interactions with
patients with different

265
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,950
backgrounds, and
even cross-cultural

266
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:36,790
interactions with your
team members as well in

267
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:40,650
the healthcare team
cultural encounters will

268
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:44,590
also require assessment
of linguistic needs

269
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:50,590
whether it has to do
with someone who may

270
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:53,590
be may not be proficient
in the english

271
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:59,350
language or they may be
deaf or hard of hearing

272
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:03,150
so you have to understand
or learn how you

273
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:05,450
can meet that specific
need to communicate.

274
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:12,970
And one key point
here is having really

275
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:15,090
the motivation to
want to, rather than

276
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:17,770
I have to engage
with a process in the

277
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:19,530
process of being
culturally aware, right?

278
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:23,710
How you approach
this whole dynamic is

279
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:26,950
so key. The level
of motivation that

280
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:31,930
you have to desire
and want to do it is

281
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:35,010
really important and
really sets the stage

282
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:37,170
for the success of
these encounters.

283
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:43,810
Here's a guide
to assess how to

284
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:47,450
develop consistent
cultural humility.

285
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:51,230
So one, ask questions
in a humble manner.

286
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:54,850
This is what a lifelong
learner is committed

287
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:57,590
to do. But one of the
things you have to

288
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:00,130
keep in mind when
you ask questions is

289
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:02,290
that you're not asking
questions for the sake

290
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:05,210
of your curiosity,
right? But you should

291
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:07,750
only really be asking
questions because it

292
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:11,450
sincerely and truly
has a lot to do with

293
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:14,270
the medical issue or
care of the patient.

294
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:17,450
And you should always
explain to the patient

295
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:19,750
why you're asking
that question, right?

296
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,830
Why are you asking
them about their

297
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:23,830
background? Why
is that important

298
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:25,280
to the care that
you provide?

299
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:28,030
how that informs
the customized care

300
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,990
that you provide for
them. So if you're

301
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:34,110
able to transition and
ask them and explain

302
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:36,190
why you're asking
them in a humble

303
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:39,990
manner, it's actually
quite inviting and

304
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:42,710
comforting that a
physician would take

305
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,330
the time to want
to know a place of

306
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:48,130
origin. How were they,
how did they experience

307
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:50,530
their life, their
life as a child?

308
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:54,110
What difficulties or
joys they experienced

309
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:56,550
growing up? What
did they learn about

310
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,870
health? What was
their experience with

311
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:01,130
healthcare professionals
growing up in that

312
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:04,190
context? Those types
of questions are really

313
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:07,710
important and it
informs you how this

314
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:11,390
individual is approaching
you, how this individual

315
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:13,390
is engaging with the
healthcare system.

316
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:16,730
Next is seek self
-awareness and you're

317
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:19,620
going to have to have
some honest people

318
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:22,880
around you who will
hold you accountable,

319
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:25,690
right? So we can't
just, we won't see what

320
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:27,190
we see until there's
someone else holding

321
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:30,170
a mirror for us. So
seek self-awareness.

322
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:33,410
One, also suspend
judgment. We all judge.

323
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:35,530
Judgment is going to
happen. We're human

324
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:39,990
beings. In healthcare,
when someone comes

325
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:42,860
with a complaint,
we have immediately,

326
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:44,690
once you get used
to it, you'll make

327
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:46,930
judgments about what
it could be, what it

328
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:49,050
may not be, what it
might be, what it

329
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:51,670
definitely isn't, et
cetera, X, Y, and Z.

330
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:56,750
So we do judge, but
the issue here is that

331
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,990
you're asked to
suspend your judgment.

332
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:01,270
And what that
means is you might

333
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:03,270
have a judgment
that comes to mind.

334
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:06,370
Just pause, let it
sit on the shelf

335
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:08,350
and you might
have to test your

336
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:11,310
assumptions, right?
In a respectful way.

337
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:13,670
So just don't jump
to conclusions.

338
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:16,470
Just, okay, a judgment
comes to mind.

339
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:20,590
put a pin on it. Be
aware of it. Hold

340
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:22,890
that tension there.
Be aware that

341
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:24,910
without checking
that judgment, it can

342
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:27,270
influence how you
speak to the patient,

343
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:29,590
how you care to
with the patient.

344
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:32,550
So again, suspend
your judgment.

345
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,530
Okay. The next
is E, express

346
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,870
kindness and
compassion. Always,

347
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,150
always. You can't,
you can't lose with

348
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:42,170
this. Express kindness
and compassion.

349
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:45,010
as support a safe and

350
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:46,470
welcoming environment.

351
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:48,970
And this is done through

352
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:51,250
verbal and
nonverbal skills.

353
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:55,190
A welcoming environment
doesn't just start

354
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:57,870
with, hey, welcome
to my clinic. Maybe

355
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,030
there's something in
your intake form that

356
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:03,010
makes them feel
unwelcome, that makes them

357
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:05,990
feel other than, that
makes them feel unseen.

358
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:08,750
Maybe there's signs
around you or the

359
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,570
area makes them feel
like they really don't

360
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:14,330
belong and you have
to get assessments of

361
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:16,650
those spaces. So a
welcoming environment

362
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:19,490
is more than a welcome
sign. It's the sense

363
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:21,570
that people feel that
they belong in your

364
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:24,070
space where you're
providing care. Okay.

365
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:26,490
And the last S is start

366
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:28,470
where the patient
is, right?

367
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:32,590
Begin where the
patient is. That

368
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:36,010
requires inquiry,
that requires empathy,

369
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:38,710
that requires
understanding. So

370
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:57,570
culture and health.

371
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:02,290
Culture is a
significant, a

372
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:04,390
significant issue
in health care.

373
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:08,550
And we may not learn
about every culture,

374
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:11,810
but you should
understand how culture

375
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:15,310
affects communication
and health outcomes.

376
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:19,660
When there is a lack of
cultural competencies,

377
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:22,810
there's a there's
some impacts to

378
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:24,830
clinical outcomes you
should be aware of.

379
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:32,250
It leads to barriers
that may include,

380
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,370
but are not limited
to, stigmas,

381
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,790
mistrust of the
patient in healthcare,

382
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:40,270
the healthcare
system and healthcare

383
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:43,990
professionals,
discrimination,

384
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:45,890
poor health outcomes
as we talked

385
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:48,290
about before,
but also higher

386
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:50,390
costs in
healthcare itself.

387
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:52,390
There are studies
that have shown this.

388
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:56,650
Other impact of
clinical outcomes

389
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:57,790
that patients
fear of being

390
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:00,500
misunderstood
or disrespected.

391
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:03,930
Providers not
familiar with the

392
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,550
prevalence of
conditions among certain

393
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:09,010
minority groups, if
you're not aware of

394
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:11,250
that, that has
significant outcomes.

395
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,390
Healthcare professionals
may fail to take

396
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:17,150
into account
differing responses to

397
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:20,290
medications or may lack
knowledge about the

398
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:23,150
traditional remedies
leading to harmful drug

399
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:25,410
interactions if they
don't ask about it.

400
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:28,690
Patients may not adhere
to medical advice

401
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:31,070
because they don't
understand or trust

402
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:33,390
the provider. That
can happen when

403
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:34,770
there's a lack of
cultural competencies.

404
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:40,150
There can be more or
fewer diagnostic tests

405
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:42,350
for patients of
different cultural

406
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:45,230
backgrounds, And that
really can affect finding

407
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:48,830
the illness or if
it's underdiagnosed,

408
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:50,970
missed illnesses.

409
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:58,170
If there are four
broad categories

410
00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:03,250
of how culture
influences health,

411
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:05,170
it would be in
the following.

412
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,970
Cultures affect
health care seeking

413
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:16,670
behavior. okay um we
are informed by our

414
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:19,190
culture how we've
been raised um the

415
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:21,920
area of the globe
we've been raised and

416
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:25,570
how and when and
the way that we seek

417
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:28,910
health care um is
influenced by that

418
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:32,910
how we perceive the
causes of our illnesses

419
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:38,270
is is informed by our
culture understanding

420
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:43,530
of disease processes
how and why illnesses

421
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:46,450
are developing in our
bodies are informed by

422
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:50,710
our culture and
treatment decisions why I

423
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:56,180
choose one thing over
the other is driven by

424
00:22:56,180 --> 00:23:02,090
our culture what I have
presented to you is

425
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:05,730
the dimensions of the
health believe model

426
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:09,970
model the dimensions
include perceived

427
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:13,670
susceptibility which
means an individual's
perceptions

428
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:16,430
of their chances of
getting the disease

429
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:21,830
perceived seriousness an
individual's knowledge

430
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:24,730
related to the
severity of the disease

431
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:30,070
perceived benefits an
individual's opinion

432
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:32,790
of desirable behavioral
health beliefs

433
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:34,890
that need to be taken
into consideration

434
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:37,960
during the treatment
plans, perceived

435
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:42,050
barriers and individuals'
opinions as to what

436
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:44,270
will stop them from
seeking behavioral

437
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:47,310
health services or health
services in general

438
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:50,670
and returning for
continued services.

439
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:53,190
And then the last
dimension is self

440
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:55,750
-efficacy. And that's
the individual's belief

441
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:58,150
that they can do
something to improve

442
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:00,910
their current
situation. Now, it's

443
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:03,980
important to be aware
of these dimensions

444
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:07,730
because as you're
educating a patient, if

445
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:09,750
they don't perceive
that it is serious,

446
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:13,370
they may not take
your advice to heart.

447
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:16,070
If they're not
convinced that

448
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:18,910
there's any benefit,
your recommendations

449
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:21,810
may not be
adhered to. Um,

450
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:25,950
a culture or a
lack of trust, um,

451
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:30,750
um, a culture of, of
the value of health

452
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:33,610
or how value is, how
health is perceived

453
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:35,530
or the trust they may
have in the healthcare

454
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:38,110
professional may
affect their, their,

455
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:40,650
their thoughts of
why the benefits of

456
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:43,450
health, the benefits,
uh, are perceived.

457
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:48,110
The culture also informs
the barriers, right?

458
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:52,150
So what is keeping
this individual from

459
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:54,030
getting health care?
Now, this model that I'm

460
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:56,970
showing you was based
out of the Technical

461
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:58,990
Assistance Network for
Children's Behavioral

462
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:00,630
Health, but you can
replace that for health

463
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:05,170
in general. So what
are the things or

464
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,810
thoughts and opinions,
for example, in the topic

465
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:11,620
of mental health, if
the culture stigmatizes

466
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:15,330
health and finds
mental health and sees

467
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:19,590
mental health simply
as a spiritual thing,

468
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:25,250
that may keep that
individual from seeking

469
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:29,910
medical treatment
for the mental

470
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:31,730
health disease that
they're experiencing.

471
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:35,050
So it's important
to know what this

472
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:38,050
individual's perceived
susceptibility is,

473
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:40,090
how serious it is,
what the benefits

474
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:43,950
barriers and how they
can engage through

475
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:46,010
empowerment in their
own care. These are

476
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:48,530
very valuable concepts
to keep in mind.

477
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:53,270
And again, in the
context of behavioral

478
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:54,430
health, and this
really can be

479
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:57,070
used for other health
values, not just

480
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:58,910
behavioral health
issue questions.

481
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:03,150
The graphs that I have
in the next couple

482
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:05,190
of slides actually
breaks down some

483
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:07,950
questions that can
be asked around

484
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:11,070
susceptibility and perceived
seriousness, right?

485
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:13,350
So around perceived
susceptibility,

486
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:15,110
one question is, does
anyone among your

487
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,640
friends and your
family share the same

488
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,990
issue as you? Did they
seek help? What was

489
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:22,950
the result? Just
seeing how people, um,

490
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:26,610
engage with, uh, health,

491
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:27,830
um,

492
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:30,230
engage with, um,

493
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:31,490
um,

494
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:34,590
um, the healthcare
system, asking them

495
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:36,590
what role do your
spiritual belief play

496
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:39,110
in, uh, in regaining
your health? Those

497
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:41,210
are really important
questions to ask.

498
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:44,490
Perceive seriousness,
right? What do you

499
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:46,470
know about your current
issue that brought you

500
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:48,710
here today? Some
questions you may ask.

501
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:51,550
how do people in your
community talk about

502
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:53,350
mental illness as an
example or it could be

503
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:55,970
anything else such as
heart attack or ******

504
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:59,710
health right how different
is the perception

505
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:01,470
of your health issue
in the american

506
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:04,270
culture compared to the
culture of your country

507
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:08,130
of origin if their
country of the origin

508
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:09,630
is the united states
so these are just

509
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:12,290
questions that you can
use not every single one

510
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:13,750
of these questions
but certainly some

511
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:16,710
questions to get a better
understanding of how

512
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:19,150
this person perceives
the seriousness of their

513
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:21,580
illness because that
way you can intervene

514
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:23,730
based on where they're
at meeting them

515
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:27,890
where they are perceived
benefits one question

516
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:30,770
you might ask is
um what things are

517
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:33,490
meaningful in your
life right what role do

518
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:36,050
spiritual beliefs play
in regaining your health

519
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:40,430
do you meditate
um have you had

520
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:43,250
any position ex
positive experiences

521
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:45,550
with behavioral uh health

522
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:49,790
Under perceived barriers,
have you ever been

523
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:52,650
discriminated against
for being different?

524
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:54,070
How did you react?

525
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:56,950
How do you want your
behavioral health care

526
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:59,030
specialist to treat
you? So these questions

527
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:02,130
are refreshing, and
these are not common

528
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:04,130
questions. If you've
been to the health

529
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:06,100
care, I've seen a health
care professional,

530
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:08,030
there's not common
things that you

531
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,860
hear, but I ask
you as osteopathic

532
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:13,350
physicians to start
having a repertoire of

533
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:16,750
questions that
really will show the

534
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:19,710
patient that you
really care about their

535
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:21,690
well-being and
want to learn more.

536
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:25,310
So take a time, go
through these questions,

537
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:27,650
have a few of them
in your pocket,

538
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:29,950
just so that you
can get a better

539
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:32,710
understanding of where
your patient is at.

540
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:37,770
So keep in mind,
cultural forces are very

541
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:40,470
powerful and they
affect health behaviors.

542
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:42,270
And if you're not
aware of it and

543
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:44,830
you're not sensitive
to it, it will limit

544
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:47,310
your ability to take
good care of folks.

545
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:50,270
I want to share
with you a patient.

546
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,530
This was a patient
that I, um, uh,

547
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:55,570
that I patient that
I, um, cared for

548
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:57,820
when I first came
out of residency.

549
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:00,790
Um, and I just wanted
to kind of just

550
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:02,870
share with you an
experience I had in

551
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:06,990
this, this, Um, her
name is, is, um,

552
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:08,790
um,

553
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:10,830
I used a different
name here to

554
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:13,270
protect, protect
her, her identity.

555
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:16,830
Um, but for the most
part, this is the

556
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:19,030
general gist and
the experience, um,

557
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:22,030
that, that we
had. So I saw a

558
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:24,030
33 year old woman
from Pakistan.

559
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:27,210
Um, she's a Muslim
woman and she presented

560
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:29,090
to the clinic for
an evaluation.

561
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:31,950
And in her official
screening, she noted

562
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:33,770
that English is
her second language

563
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:35,630
and she's she's
proficient in English.

564
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:39,430
So she did not require
an interpreter.

565
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:41,650
She was very comfortable

566
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:42,990
communicating with me.

567
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,590
She also shared that
she had preferred to

568
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:47,770
see female, a female
physician. And in the

569
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:52,050
encounter, I came to
find out that she had

570
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:54,950
a medical history of
diabetes and she hadn't

571
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:56,910
been taking her
medications for some time

572
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:58,270
now. i'm just trying
to get a better

573
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:03,470
understanding of um
why um and get a better

574
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:07,950
understanding of what
happened and something to

575
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:09,970
the point of she just
wanted to get back

576
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:14,220
on it again she hasn't
been feeling well um

577
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,190
and so it's just a
discussion that we had

578
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:18,690
during that time but
what really drove her

579
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:21,530
to come in was because
she had complaints

580
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:23,910
of vaginal discharge
and frequency

581
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:27,410
and urination So
we did some labs.

582
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:30,110
We found out that
her blood sugars

583
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:32,510
indeed was very
much elevated.

584
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:40,970
And in that, we realized
we needed to start

585
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:42,810
her back on her
medication. She was on

586
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:46,250
insulin. We gave her
and provided in-depth

587
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:50,610
education, had her repeat
back the instructions.

588
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:52,450
She said she was
committed to get

589
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,850
back on it and she was
supposed to come back

590
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:58,130
and see me after
after a month with her

591
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:01,990
results with her with
her records so we can

592
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:05,430
go ahead and and um
and make sure that she

593
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:08,970
was right on track
so upon her return we

594
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:11,290
rechecked her blood
sugars and it was it

595
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:13,310
stayed really hot
there wasn't any change

596
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:17,710
and she still remained
pretty frustrated that

597
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:20,630
the vaginal discharge
had not resolved.

598
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:25,310
So what I wanted to
do, because I thought

599
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:28,470
we educated well,
gave her the right

600
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:32,750
prescription. She
showed me how she knew

601
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:34,810
how to take the
insulin and when to

602
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:37,890
take it and how much
she showed it all. But

603
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:42,910
I ran into something
and I couldn't,

604
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:45,670
I had to take a deeper
dive. And I used

605
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:48,810
the health belief
model to help me, um,

606
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:51,190
um, get a better
understanding of what's

607
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:55,130
going on. So when I wanted
to see her perceived

608
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:58,230
seriousness of this
situation, and it was

609
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:02,110
the discomfort she
was experiencing, um,

610
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:07,810
with dysuria and vaginal
discharge. Um, also

611
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:10,650
her perceived, the
perceived benefits of

612
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:12,990
treatment I asked her
was that she would be

613
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:15,370
able to care for her
family. And she was

614
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:17,610
concerned about the
complications of diabetes.

615
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:18,990
So it was important
for me to see what

616
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:21,110
was important for her.
So I could keep that

617
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:24,190
in mind, um, as a source
of her motivation.

618
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:27,830
Um, and then I asked
about some barriers.

619
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:31,090
And when I took a deeper
dive, she said she

620
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:34,470
felt some shame in using
the insulin, right?

621
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:37,570
She, um, and she
couldn't eat what, what

622
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:39,750
her family eats. Like
she couldn't eat what

623
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,990
she cooked for her
family. And that really

624
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:45,510
brought some sense
of isolation to her.

625
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:50,990
And so that actually
opened up a lot of

626
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:54,690
doors and discussion
and really helped me

627
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:58,810
to see her lived
experience when it came to

628
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:01,650
diabetes. Diabetes
meant shame for her.

629
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:04,090
It means isolation.
And usually when we

630
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:06,090
think about those
illnesses, we really don't

631
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:08,490
think about it in
that terms, but that

632
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:10,290
was her lived
experience. And that was

633
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:13,150
important for me to
keep in mind as I was

634
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:16,130
coaching and helping
her and supporting her.

635
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:19,690
The other thing around
self-efficacy is

636
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:21,450
wanting to know if she
can do it on her own or

637
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:23,690
if she needed more
professional help, right?

638
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:26,570
And how can we use
the role of her family

639
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:30,430
and her spirituality to
enable self-efficacy?

640
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:33,910
So just so that you
know, little bit

641
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:37,250
background, the elevated
blood sugars cause

642
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:39,230
increased urination. So
that's why she was having

643
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:41,770
these issues. So the
blood sugars itself

644
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:46,110
being high was not
alarming, but this part

645
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:48,830
was in the vaginal
discharge, which was a

646
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:50,750
yeast infection that
causes us, that usually

647
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:52,910
comes from uncontrolled
blood sugars of

648
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:54,750
what really was driving
it. So that's what

649
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:57,410
caused her. So if she
had, you know, checked

650
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,890
her blood and her
blood sugars are really

651
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:02,790
high, that wasn't the
thing that tipped her

652
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,450
off the edge. It were
these complications

653
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:07,090
from it that was, that
was causing it. So,

654
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:09,590
um, I just wanted
to just share with

655
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:11,210
you just the
breakdown of how this

656
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:13,710
model can give me
a better insight of

657
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:15,700
how she was
experiencing diabetes.

658
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:20,670
As I mentioned before,
culture influences

659
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:22,530
how people make
judgment and make sense

660
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:24,410
about the world and
the decisions about

661
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:29,090
their behavior. um it
defines good it defines

662
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:33,410
bad healthy unhealthy
large body types

663
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:36,250
in some cultures may
signify wealth and

664
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:40,170
well-being right um it
affects daily habits

665
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:42,910
of living food choices
for people groups

666
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:44,310
who live in the
mediterranean is much

667
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:47,390
different from people
who um live in the

668
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:50,430
united states so just
really important again

669
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:53,470
not to overlook culture
these are just a

670
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:56,050
few graphs that
highlight how behaviors,

671
00:34:56,710 --> 00:35:00,150
culture-related
behaviors affect health.

672
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:02,030
For example,

673
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:06,690
cultures can affect
how food are prepared.

674
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:10,710
Cultures can affect,

675
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:13,510
cultures related
to the type of

676
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:15,230
interventions that
are acceptable.

677
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:18,050
Cultures related to
the response of disease

678
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:20,690
and interventions,
right? And how they

679
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:24,050
adhere to the
practices or adhere to

680
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:27,070
the recommendations
that one may make.

681
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:30,250
Okay, so just some
things to keep in mind.

682
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:33,630
Religion also,
there's a culture

683
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:35,010
within different
religions and

684
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:37,870
that may affect
****** behaviors,

685
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:40,430
certain food to avoid
or some religions

686
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:45,490
that doesn't allow
the eating of certain

687
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:50,070
foods like pork or beef
or drinking alcohol

688
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:52,970
or tobacco use. So
those are important

689
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:56,410
things to keep in mind
in terms of how culture

690
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:58,470
may inform health
behavior. So as I

691
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:01,150
mentioned before, religion
may influence attitudes

692
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:03,890
and social practices,
****** practices,

693
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:06,970
food, alcohol,
tobacco, response to

694
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:09,050
symptoms. People groups
may not prescribe

695
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:11,970
traditional Western
medical care as a response

696
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:14,750
to symptoms. Some
people may choose to

697
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:17,150
respond by first through
prayer and meditation

698
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,990
before they go and
seek out health

699
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:21,830
care. And so that's
important to know that.

700
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:24,850
So you can incorporate
that or be aware

701
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:26,650
of that in the care
you're providing

702
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:29,570
patients. Other areas
where you might see

703
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:31,190
religion, faith
or spirituality

704
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:35,690
influencing health is
types of intervention,

705
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:38,830
right? Blood
transfusion for Jehovah

706
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:41,290
Witnesses, attitudes
towards stem cell

707
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:43,950
research, attitude
towards contraception

708
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:45,690
or abortion,
certain aspects of

709
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:47,750
end-of-life treatment,
even fertility,

710
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:51,950
response to diseases,
the role of prayer

711
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:54,550
as an intervention
to alter outcomes. So

712
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:57,250
these are lived
experiences that you should

713
00:36:57,250 --> 00:37:00,310
be aware of. And
having a patient know

714
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:02,670
that their physician,
even if you don't

715
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:05,030
practice or share
that, but the fact that

716
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:07,050
you're bringing it up
in the conversation

717
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:10,150
really will show that
patient that you care

718
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:12,610
and that they want to
share more information

719
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:14,070
with you. And that
information they

720
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:16,390
share with you really
can unlock some

721
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:18,390
things for you in the
way that you provide

722
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:21,930
care. So really important
to keep in mind.

723
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:25,410
Again, I've mentioned
this before that

724
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:27,570
while we talk about
culture, there are

725
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:29,890
various degrees to
which individuals adhere

726
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:32,070
to the norms of
their own culture. So

727
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:35,650
don't assume they
adhere to all the norms.

728
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:38,950
Let them let you know
to ask them first,

729
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:41,090
right? Because it's
important for you to know

730
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:43,090
because it is affecting
their health care.

731
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:45,350
and keep in mind
that people belong

732
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:47,530
to more than one
culture, okay?

733
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:50,350
Culture related to

734
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:55,290
gender identity or
geography or profession,

735
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:56,730
right? Being a
healthcare professional

736
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:58,350
is a culture.
We have our own

737
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:01,390
language, the way we
process things, the

738
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:03,010
way we engage with
the world and other

739
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:06,090
people. So we live
in subcultures within

740
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:08,370
ourselves as complex
human beings.

741
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:11,130
there are five
essential elements of

742
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:13,710
cultural competencies
one assessing cultural

743
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:15,890
knowledge and avoiding
stereotypes in

744
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:19,650
the process valuing
diversity managing the

745
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:22,210
dynamic of difference
right there's a the

746
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:24,130
way that we manage
that is really key

747
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:27,270
and adapting to
diversity and then

748
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:29,850
institutionalizing cultural
knowledge these five

749
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:34,390
core context concepts
are um are known

750
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:37,210
as these five essential

751
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:38,930
elements to
cultural competency.

752
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:42,850
So when you, when
we're, our approach to

753
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:44,890
cultural competency is
that we're developing

754
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:47,450
a skill set and a framework
through a critical

755
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:50,150
conscious of self and
others in the world.

756
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:52,650
And we're really
posturing ourselves as a

757
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:55,630
curious learner. So
in cultural humility,

758
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:58,010
in this context is
developing a lifelong

759
00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:00,830
commitment towards self
-evaluation and critique,

760
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:03,150
as I mentioned before,
when engaging with

761
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:05,890
patients and communities
of different culture,

762
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:08,970
always from a place
of empathy, right?

763
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:13,050
And understanding.
Now we say this now,

764
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:15,890
because right now you're
sitting, you're listening

765
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:17,370
to this lecture,
you're taking some

766
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:21,530
notes, but when you are
in the heat of health,

767
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:24,070
the healthcare system,
where your patient

768
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:27,030
panel is long, there
are complex situations.

769
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:29,830
You may be dealing with
your own situations.

770
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:32,090
You may be dealing
with your own problems

771
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:34,630
and you're coming
into a very complex

772
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:37,610
healthcare system with
a complex healthcare

773
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:41,130
team. Those tensions
are very, very real. And

774
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:44,110
if you don't learn how
to practice mindfulness,

775
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:48,830
self-evaluation
and critique in the

776
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:51,170
most tense times,
because the healthcare

777
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:54,750
system is not the
easiest place to practice

778
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:56,810
this. That's why I'm
telling you this now so

779
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:59,350
you can be aware of
this if you begin to

780
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:02,870
practice these mindsets
and it becomes like a

781
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:05,750
second hand for you
no matter what the

782
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:09,170
tensions are you can
you'll be able to to to

783
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:12,010
step into this mode of
cultural humility almost

784
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:13,890
immediately because
you're aware if not

785
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:16,630
if not if you don't
errors are going

786
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:20,510
to happen if you
don't cost will

787
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:23,810
be high if you don't
people can die.

788
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:26,730
And when you have that
level of awareness,

789
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:29,750
you will pause, you
will be mindful no

790
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:32,170
matter how tension
and how high the

791
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:34,430
tension may be when
you're stepping into

792
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:36,010
that. So you'll always
have that tension as

793
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:37,520
a healthcare
professional. You'll see

794
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,710
those things are there.
That's why you have

795
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:41,430
to start practicing
those skills now.

796
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:42,970
Okay.

797
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:46,030
Um, the cultural
proficiency continuum

798
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:49,570
is a model that's often
used to talk about

799
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:53,270
cultural competency
as a spectrum, right?

800
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:56,510
So there's cultural
destructiveness,

801
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:59,410
cultural incapacity,
cultural blindness,

802
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,070
cultural pre
-competency, cultural

803
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:05,110
competence, and cultural
proficiency. All right.

804
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:07,090
So as I mentioned
before, I know that

805
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:08,590
we have been talking
about different

806
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:11,470
terms in a discipline
of cultural competency,

807
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:13,970
cultural humility,
cultural competability.

808
00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:18,050
Okay. This is a
spectrum of, um,

809
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:21,570
different spaces
people may land in the

810
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:25,510
continual of cultural
proficiency. Okay.

811
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:30,750
So the first three
cultural destructiveness,

812
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:34,090
cultural incapacity,
cultural blindness are

813
00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:37,290
on the negative, uh,
side of the spectrum,

814
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:40,210
right? So, um, under
cultural destructiveness,

815
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:42,770
they see, an individual
may see a cultural

816
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:45,210
difference and they
aim to eliminate it.

817
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:45,870
Okay.

818
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:46,970
Um,

819
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:49,530
a prime example of
this is indigenous

820
00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:52,730
people in this
country, right? So, um,

821
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:55,250
you have a group
of people from a

822
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:57,510
different, from a
different place who comes

823
00:41:57,510 --> 00:42:01,010
to this, to this,
to this country, um,

824
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:04,550
and encounter
indigenous people and

825
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:07,510
literally indigenous
people were eliminated,

826
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:09,610
uh, where this culture
would be due to,

827
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:12,990
um, so many, so many
things that have, um,

828
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:15,010
essentially genocide
that has eliminated

829
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:17,610
this people group.
Next you see, see

830
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:20,950
culture difference and
you devalue it, right?

831
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:23,650
So, um, yes, there's
a difference, but

832
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:28,850
it's less than, um,
it's your, you, there's

833
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:31,990
a posture of
superiority over it. Um,

834
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:34,370
and that's cultural
incapacity. And there's

835
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:37,110
cultural blindness,
where you see cultural

836
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:40,410
difference, but you
act as if it, if

837
00:42:40,410 --> 00:42:42,310
you don't, as if it
doesn't matter, something

838
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:44,610
where someone
may say, oh, I'm

839
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:47,150
colorblind, right? I'm
culturally blind. Well,

840
00:42:47,370 --> 00:42:49,690
although the intent
of that comment

841
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:54,630
is usually said to
explain that, um,

842
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:57,790
um, that, that there is
no difference amongst

843
00:42:57,790 --> 00:43:00,390
people, that posture
actually is, is, can,

844
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:02,490
can cause some danger
to people because

845
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:05,690
if you're not aware
of how someone's lived

846
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:09,870
experience is affecting
how they engage with

847
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:13,990
the healthcare system,
you are negating a

848
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:16,250
whole side of their
lives that needs to be

849
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:18,370
aware of so that you
can provide really good

850
00:43:18,370 --> 00:43:21,470
care. So it's not a
helpful posture to be

851
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:25,710
culturally blind. Okay.
On the other side of

852
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:27,690
the continuum, you
have cultural pre

853
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:30,790
-competence, right? You
have, you see the cultural

854
00:43:30,790 --> 00:43:32,510
difference and you're
making some efforts,

855
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:34,950
but it's not working
out that great. It's

856
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:37,490
maybe not responding
totally appropriately,

857
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:39,590
but you know, you have
to. So you're kind

858
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:41,210
of in this learning
stage, you know, you have

859
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:43,130
to make a difference,
but there's some

860
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:46,850
response that's, that's
inappropriately made.

861
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:49,550
And then the next one
is cultural competence.

862
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:51,230
So you see the
cultural difference,

863
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:52,770
you appreciate it and
actually making more

864
00:43:52,770 --> 00:43:55,130
appropriate steps,
right? And the next

865
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:57,190
step after that is
seeking is cultural

866
00:43:57,190 --> 00:43:59,330
proficiency, where
you're actually seeking

867
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:02,490
out these experiences.
Like you desire it,

868
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:04,670
you wanna learn more,
you're an advocate

869
00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:07,710
for that inequity. So
that's the spectrum

870
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:13,110
of cultural competency
or proficiency.

871
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:15,350
And this is just for the

872
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:17,150
breakdown of
this definition

873
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:22,530
adapted from a manual
for school leaders

874
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:24,870
around the area of
cultural competency, right?

875
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:26,590
And cultural
destructiveness, as we said

876
00:44:26,590 --> 00:44:28,110
before, you see the
difference you want to

877
00:44:28,110 --> 00:44:30,550
stomp it out so that
could be manifested in

878
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:32,870
attitudes practices
policies that are

879
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:35,310
destructive to cultures
you have cultural

880
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:37,990
incapacity you see the
difference you make it

881
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:40,170
wrong so there are
systems and individuals in

882
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:42,050
a culture that are
extremely biased believe

883
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:44,250
in a superiority of
a dominant group and

884
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:46,850
assume paternal posture
toward those of the

885
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:49,130
lesser groups and these
systems or individuals

886
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:51,170
are often characterized
by unrealistic

887
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:53,590
fear of people who
are different from

888
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:54,750
the dominant group
and then you have

889
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:57,230
cultural blindness as
we said before, where

890
00:44:57,230 --> 00:44:59,190
the belief that the
culture makes no

891
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:01,070
difference, right?
There's a belief that

892
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:03,050
no matter what the
culture of the person,

893
00:45:03,050 --> 00:45:04,870
I'm going to treat
everyone the same.

894
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:07,690
While you should be
respectful of everyone,

895
00:45:07,690 --> 00:45:10,050
it could be very
dangerous if you make the

896
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:12,770
same assumptions about
people's lived experiences,

897
00:45:12,770 --> 00:45:14,370
because people's
lived experiences are

898
00:45:14,370 --> 00:45:16,610
different. And that
means how they come into

899
00:45:16,610 --> 00:45:18,550
the healthcare system
and their expectations

900
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:20,010
will be different,
and those needs will

901
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:22,940
not be met. So that is
not a helpful posture.

902
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:26,930
But moving toward pre
-competence is that

903
00:45:26,930 --> 00:45:28,920
there's an awareness,
but there's a

904
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:31,200
limitation in the way
that you're responding.

905
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,810
Although you want
to desire, you

906
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:35,170
desire for the change,
moving to competency,

907
00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:39,630
where you begin
to grow and learn,

908
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:42,110
seek experiences out,

909
00:45:42,570 --> 00:45:46,930
start adapting policies
and practices that

910
00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:49,750
can respond to different
cultural contexts

911
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:51,870
in the populations
you're caring for.

912
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:53,550
And then you move to
cultural proficiency

913
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:55,080
and you see the
difference in response.

914
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:58,470
So please have these
definite, be comfortable

915
00:45:58,470 --> 00:46:01,360
with these definitions
and these different

916
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:08,590
milestones in the,
in the continuum.

917
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:14,110
Moving to our cultural
competency. So elicit

918
00:46:14,110 --> 00:46:16,190
the patient's understanding
of the illness

919
00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:19,030
and strategies for
identifying different

920
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:21,710
styles of communication.
Ask them, tell me

921
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:23,970
what you understand
about what's going on,

922
00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:27,430
right? Ask them about
their preferences.

923
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:30,190
What is the role
of their family

924
00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:32,550
members in their
decision-making,

925
00:46:32,810 --> 00:46:33,370
right?

926
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:35,710
Acknowledge the use
of complementary

927
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:37,750
alternative medicine.
If they're using

928
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:40,250
it, let them ask
them, Hey, tell me

929
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:41,690
what you're using.
And you're not going

930
00:46:41,690 --> 00:46:43,370
to know every, I
mean, it's such, it's,

931
00:46:43,370 --> 00:46:44,790
there's so many
things out there and

932
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:46,050
you're not going
to know everything.

933
00:46:46,310 --> 00:46:49,690
Um, but it's really
important to ask, have

934
00:46:49,690 --> 00:46:52,030
a conversation and
say, hey, I'm not

935
00:46:52,030 --> 00:46:54,970
familiar with this over
-the-counter medication

936
00:46:54,970 --> 00:46:56,950
or this thing you're
getting by mail. I'll

937
00:46:56,950 --> 00:46:59,390
have to look some
things up because I want

938
00:46:59,390 --> 00:47:01,930
to know how this may
affect the care that

939
00:47:01,930 --> 00:47:03,350
I'm going to be
providing for you. So I

940
00:47:03,350 --> 00:47:05,410
need to know that.
Perhaps you can hold off

941
00:47:05,410 --> 00:47:07,170
on taking that until
I find out because

942
00:47:07,170 --> 00:47:08,810
I'm giving you some
medication, for example,

943
00:47:08,810 --> 00:47:10,610
for your blood
pressure. I want to make

944
00:47:10,610 --> 00:47:12,290
sure what I'm providing
for you isn't going

945
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:14,710
to cause a conflict
in your body. Okay.

946
00:47:15,970 --> 00:47:18,990
Being a really good
physician requires some

947
00:47:18,990 --> 00:47:21,990
good negotiation
skills in the best way.

948
00:47:21,990 --> 00:47:23,670
Number one, when you
start with negotiations,

949
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:26,850
you have that
patient's interest in

950
00:47:26,850 --> 00:47:29,330
mind. That is your
starting point, empathy and

951
00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:31,750
their best interest
in mind. Number two,

952
00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:35,690
their best, your
idea of their best

953
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:37,890
interest doesn't mean
anything if it's not

954
00:47:37,890 --> 00:47:40,630
centered at the core
of their values,

955
00:47:40,670 --> 00:47:43,350
at the core of their
understanding of their

956
00:47:43,350 --> 00:47:47,030
lived experience, right?
So that must drive

957
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:49,670
that conversation
when you're providing

958
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:51,700
care for patients. So,
and there's a lot of

959
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:53,550
negotiation, right,
about what's important

960
00:47:53,550 --> 00:47:54,970
to them and what you're
providing for them

961
00:47:54,970 --> 00:47:57,570
as a healthcare
professional to see, well,

962
00:47:57,570 --> 00:47:59,530
how does what I'm, how
is what I'm offering

963
00:47:59,530 --> 00:48:02,850
you going to fit in,
in what's important

964
00:48:02,850 --> 00:48:05,230
to you and how you
want to take it, right?

965
00:48:05,570 --> 00:48:08,170
use skills to increase
your awareness of

966
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:11,850
mistrust prejudice and
the impact that may

967
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:16,870
have in clinical
decision making so you

968
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:18,870
must understand your
patient population you

969
00:48:18,870 --> 00:48:21,030
must understand acceptable
social behaviors

970
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:23,710
you must understand
the awareness of

971
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:25,510
cultural health and
acquiring cultural

972
00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:29,350
sensitivity and
incorporating all above all

973
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:31,710
of the above for the
care of your patient

974
00:48:32,830 --> 00:48:37,170
Now, for your DPR
lab, I'm going to ask

975
00:48:37,170 --> 00:48:40,030
you to take the implicit
assessment tests.

976
00:48:40,030 --> 00:48:42,630
There's a hyperlink
on your PowerPoint.

977
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:45,250
Please take it
before your lab.

978
00:48:45,470 --> 00:48:49,470
Also, in the CPG,
there is a module

979
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:51,650
that you are going
to be asked to

980
00:48:51,650 --> 00:48:53,390
take on maternal
health and health

981
00:48:53,390 --> 00:48:55,710
disparities. That
module is going to be

982
00:48:55,710 --> 00:48:59,270
needed for you to,
uh, to take, um,

983
00:48:59,850 --> 00:49:02,630
uh, so that it can count
towards your credit

984
00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:04,510
of your truck, towards
credit, towards

985
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:07,890
your, your, your, your,
um, grade for DPR.

986
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:09,950
So please make sure that

987
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:11,690
you take the modules,

988
00:49:12,010 --> 00:49:13,950
read the CPG and take the

989
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:15,770
IAT before your next lab.

990
00:49:16,970 --> 00:49:18,650
Thank you so much.
