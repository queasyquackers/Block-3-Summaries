1
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:04,360
This is part three
of the FOM lecture on

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,500
the introduction of
the head and neck. And

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,180
in this part, we're
gonna be covering all

4
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,280
12 cranial nerves.
And this will serve

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,500
as an introductory
summary and overview of

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,170
these cranial nerves,
which are vitally

7
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:18,160
important for the
function of not only the

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,840
head and neck, but
the rest of the body.

9
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,740
So the cranial nerves,
as I mentioned, there

10
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,540
are 12 of them and
they are numbered based

11
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:31,140
on the sequence in which
they leave the brain

12
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,180
cavity. So all of them
emerge from the brain

13
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,000
and they exit the brain
cavity in order to

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,100
innervate structures
outside of the skull.

15
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,660
So it starts
anteriorly from

16
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,820
olfactory nerve or
cranial nerve 1.

17
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,540
And then the larger
numbers, cranial nerve

18
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,860
11 and 12, for example,
the accessory and

19
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,300
hypoglossal nerves
emerge from the brain

20
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,600
and exit the brain
cavity more posteriorly.

21
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,140
so it is your
responsibility to know

22
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,400
how these cranial
nerves exit the brain

23
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,540
cavity and into the
structures within

24
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,660
and outside the
skull but we won't go

25
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:13,320
over this in detail
right now because

26
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,620
of interest of time
but make sure to

27
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:18,520
know their cranial
exits for the exams

28
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,560
a useful resource for
learning the functions

29
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,860
of different cranial
nerves is in the more

30
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,140
clinically oriented
anatomy ninth edition

31
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,940
which you have access
to to the electronic

32
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:34,460
copy through the NYIT
library and specifically

33
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,880
figure 10.4 which
is shown here shows

34
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,560
a nice diagram where
it highlights all the

35
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,860
different functionalities
of the cranial

36
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:44,700
nerves and as i mentioned
in the beginning

37
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,940
of this part of the
video or the lecture.

38
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,700
This is just an
introductory overview of

39
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,500
these 12 cranial nerves.
So I will be going

40
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,960
over just one or a couple
of the functions of

41
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,060
each of these nerves,
but make sure by the

42
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,200
end of the block,
you will need to know

43
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,620
all the functions of
all 12 cranial nerves.

44
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,840
So towards this goal,
I highly recommend

45
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,600
you to pause this video
to create this table

46
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,180
right here. And
what this table will

47
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,680
show is summarize basically
all the information

48
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,160
I will be giving
you, not only in this

49
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,430
part of the lecture,
but by other lectures

50
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:29,300
given by the anatomy
faculty members.

51
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,400
So in the first
column, you'll have the

52
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,360
cranial nerves numbered
as well as their names.

53
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,420
In the second column,
you can have the

54
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,380
cranial exits. So
these are the foramina

55
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,940
or the openings
that the cranial

56
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,200
nerves will use to
exit the brain cavity.

57
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,000
And then we also have
the fiber types. Are

58
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,890
they sensory, motor,
visceral, or skeletal?

59
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,500
And then their functions.

60
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,800
So what do they do?

61
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,720
So what we're going to
do now is we're going

62
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,840
to go through this
cranial nerve marathon.

63
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,880
And I'm going to make
it interactive so

64
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,440
you understand some
of the functions.

65
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,920
so the best way to
start is with cranial

66
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,220
nerve 1 which is also
called olfactory nerve

67
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,680
and tract and
the reason why we

68
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,780
differentiate between
olfactory nerve and tract

69
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:16,560
is the stock that you
see here coming out

70
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,060
of the brain is
referred to as olfactory

71
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,260
tract because technically
it's not a nerve

72
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,080
it's actually a
pinched portion of the

73
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,380
brain that extends
towards the nasal cavity

74
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:32,040
but the olfactory nerve
refers to the nerves

75
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,100
that connect the
olfactory bulb to the

76
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:39,100
sensors in the olfactory
epithelium which is

77
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,780
where you're actually
going to be smelling

78
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:44,440
the compounds so
olfactory nerve as the

79
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,060
name implies has only
one function and this

80
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,740
is olfaction or the sense
of smell and because

81
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:53,260
sense of smell is one
of the five special

82
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,000
senses that only
exist in the head and

83
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,380
neck, its fiber type
is special sensory. So

84
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:03,120
if you have a coffee,
a tea, or any kind of

85
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,480
food in front of you,
you can go ahead and

86
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,040
smell it. And you can
thank this cranial

87
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,880
nerve or the olfactory
nerve for allowing

88
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,020
you to smell wonderful
things in the world.

89
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,020
Now let's go over
to the optic nerve.

90
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:23,360
And similar to the
olfactory nerve, this

91
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,520
has only one special
function, which is

92
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,520
vision. And because
vision is one of those

93
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,840
five special senses,
the fiber types

94
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,320
is also going to be
special sensory. So

95
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,060
if you're looking at
these slides right

96
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,560
now, then you can
thank the optic nerve.

97
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:46,910
Moving forward, we
have the oculomotor

98
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:48,650
nerve, which is
cranial nerve three.

99
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:50,750
So if you see the
laser pointer right

100
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,050
now on the slide,
you can follow it

101
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:57,230
around the slides
while you keep your

102
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:00,610
head still. So just
move your eyes.

103
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,370
And if you're following
the laser pointer,

104
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,640
then it means that
you're using this

105
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:09,410
oculomotor nerve. So
oculomotor nerve is

106
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:12,310
responsible for providing
motor innervation to

107
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:16,230
extraocular muscles,
which surround the eyes.

108
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,810
And these include
the superior ******,

109
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:21,070
inferior ******, and
medial ****** muscles,

110
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,790
as well as inferior
oblique and levator

111
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,430
palpebrae superioris.
And this last muscle

112
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:29,910
is responsible for
elevating your eyelids.

113
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:34,490
And you'll notice that
I have a grayed out

114
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:37,790
text down here. So in
subsequent slides, if

115
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,530
you see these gray
texts, it means that

116
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:42,530
these are other functions
and the fiber types

117
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:44,770
that are included
in these cranial

118
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:47,070
nerves. But for now,
don't really focus

119
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:49,370
on them. For this
week, just focus on

120
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:51,730
learning at least
one or two of the

121
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:53,770
functions of each of
the cranial nerves.

122
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:56,430
Next up is the trochlear

123
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:58,350
nerve, cranial
nerve four.

124
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:02,630
And just like the
last slide with the

125
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:05,450
oculomotor nerve,
while keeping your

126
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:08,850
head still, follow
the laser pointer.

127
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,690
So look down and
then to the side.

128
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:17,270
And this is the
function of the superior

129
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:20,010
oblique muscle. So this
is another nerve that's

130
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:21,970
responsible for eye
movement or at least

131
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:24,550
one component of it.
And so it provides

132
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:28,890
somatic motor innervation
to the superior oblique

133
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:31,250
muscle. And the word
trochlear comes from

134
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,410
Greek word trochlea,
which means pulley.

135
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:37,330
So when you're dissecting
in the orbit region

136
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:40,330
in the anatomy lab,
you're able to see

137
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:43,590
the superior oblique
actually go through

138
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,850
this pulley system. And
that's why they have

139
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:51,410
a slightly strange
action on the eyeball.

140
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,310
Now, what I want
you to do is make

141
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,850
this face that
Albert Einstein

142
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,670
is making in this
famous photo.

143
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:02,590
And keep in mind what
you can see in this

144
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:05,130
photo, which part of
the face and the tongue.

145
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:12,370
And the sensory innervation
for what you saw

146
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:13,990
on Albert Einstein's
face, and hopefully

147
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:16,850
your face if you were
making one, is the

148
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:20,710
trigeminal nerve. So it
provides somatic sensory

149
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:23,470
innervation to most
of the head, as well

150
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,710
as the teeth. And it's
divided into three

151
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:28,210
major branches or
divisions, which you will

152
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:30,970
learn in both lab and
subsequent lectures.

153
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,370
So this means that if
someone touches your

154
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:39,070
face, hopefully you
don't get punched in

155
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,690
the face. But what
you're feeling, the

156
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:43,390
sensation, is thanks to
the trigeminal nerve.

157
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:48,490
cranial nerve six uh
so we're almost halfway

158
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:52,230
there is called abducens
nerve uh so just

159
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:55,090
like the trochlear
nerve it provides motor

160
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:57,150
innovation or somatic
motor innovation

161
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:00,330
to one of the extraocular
muscles that move

162
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:02,570
the eye and this is the
lateral ****** muscle

163
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:06,130
which abduxt the
eye so hold up your

164
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:09,790
skull or head still
and follow the laser

165
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:13,350
pointer and when you're
moving your eyes side

166
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:16,770
to side, you can thank
the abducens nerve.

167
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,270
Now we're on to
the facial nerve or

168
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:22,530
cranial nerve
seven. And so what I

169
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:25,590
would like you to
do is make a smile.

170
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:32,090
And facial nerve is
the cranial nerve

171
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:33,950
that allows you to make
facial expressions.

172
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:36,270
So they provide somatic
motor innervation

173
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:38,470
to muscles of facial
expression. And

174
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:40,790
there's a lot in
humans because facial

175
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:43,330
expression is such
an important part of

176
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:45,770
our daily lives,
including healthcare.

177
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,090
And you'll see that
it has a lot of

178
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:49,890
other functions,
which again, you

179
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:52,070
don't need to worry
about today, but

180
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,770
you will need to
know for the exams.

181
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:01,580
Cranial nerve eight is
called vestibulocochlear.

182
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:04,050
So what I'd like
you to do is,

183
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:06,710
well, if you're hearing
this lecture, it means

184
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:08,890
that you're using
the sense of hearing.

185
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:11,430
And if you want to
stand up and do some

186
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:15,390
jumping jacks and sway
your body left and

187
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:18,010
right, you should be
able to sense, you

188
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:19,810
know, where you are in
the space. And that's

189
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,950
because of the sense
of balance that you

190
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:24,390
have. And both hearing
and balance are

191
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:27,190
provided by this
vestibulocochlear nerve.

192
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:29,870
And both of these
senses are, of course,

193
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,830
two of the five
special senses of the

194
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:34,530
head and neck. So the
cranial nerve eight

195
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:36,310
or vestibulocochlear
nerve provides

196
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,930
special sensory nerves
or innervations.

197
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,190
Next up is
glossopharyngeal nerve or

198
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:47,210
cranial nerve 9. And
if you have food or

199
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:49,910
drink in front of
you, ingest them and

200
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:53,570
any taste that you
can sense towards the

201
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:56,290
back of the tongue
is thanks to the

202
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:57,890
glossopharyngeal
nerve. So they provide

203
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:00,250
special sensory or
the sense of taste

204
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,950
for a posterior one
third of the tongue.

205
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:05,770
Another function that
I'd like you to know

206
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:07,550
at this point for
glossopharyngeal nerve

207
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,410
is that they provide
visceral sensory

208
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:11,650
innervation to the
carotid sinus and body,

209
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:13,490
which talked about
earlier in this lecture.

210
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:19,450
Now we're on to the
vagus nerve or the

211
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:22,180
cranial nerve 10. This
is a big nerve and

212
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:26,530
it provides visceral
motor innervation.

213
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:28,290
So it's part of the
parasympathetic pathway

214
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:30,730
for all the smooth
muscles and glands in

215
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:33,030
the thoracic abdominal
visceral organs.

216
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:37,690
So vagus means wander
in Latin. So it

217
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:39,650
lives up to its
name. So its nerves

218
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:42,310
extends all the way
from the head, neck

219
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:44,950
into the thoracic
abdominal regions.

220
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:48,930
So one of the other
functions is actually

221
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,370
what you're hearing.
The ability for

222
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:54,850
me to speak is thanks
due to the vagus

223
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:57,510
nervous, specifically
the recurrent

224
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:59,690
laryngeal nerves,
which is a branch off

225
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:01,770
of the vagus, which
you would have seen

226
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:05,170
in block one anatomy
labs. So remember

227
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:07,670
that function as
well for this week.

228
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,690
Okay. So the penultimate
cranial nerve is

229
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:14,770
called spinal accessory
nerve or cranial

230
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:17,170
nerve 11. So this is
partly going to be

231
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:18,870
reviewed because this
is one of the first

232
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:22,230
nerves that you
studied in the anatomy

233
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:25,190
lab. So So you know
from before that

234
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:27,510
spinal accessory nerve
provides somatic motor

235
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:29,970
innervation through
the trapezius

236
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:33,170
muscle, but it
also innervates the

237
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:36,110
sternocleidomastory muscle,
the side of the neck.

238
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:39,070
So what that allows
you to do is to

239
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:42,110
rotate your head to
the left and the right.

240
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:44,090
So do that right
now. And that's all

241
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:46,050
thanks to the spinal
accessory nerve.

242
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,170
Now we're at the end.
So this is cranial

243
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:52,790
nerve 12 or the
hypoglossal nerve.

244
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:55,690
And this nerve
allows for tongue

245
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,690
movement. So let's
stick our tongues out.

246
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:00,270
And being able
to do that is

247
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:02,490
due to this
hypoglossal nerve.

248
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:10,670
So we've gone through
all 12 cranial nerves,

249
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,750
and it can be overwhelming.
But the earlier

250
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,010
you start studying
these cranial nerves,

251
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:17,150
the easier time you
will have with the rest

252
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:19,210
of the block on head
and neck in anatomy.

253
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:22,450
And because these 12
cranial nerves help to

254
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:26,230
unify the functions
of the head and neck.

255
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:29,350
So what's a great way
to organize all the

256
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:31,230
12 cranial nerves?
So this is one of the

257
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:33,010
ways which might be
helpful when you're

258
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:36,170
studying. So first, the
one grouping you can

259
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:39,690
have is to have cranial
nerves that only

260
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:43,150
provide special sensory
fibers and nothing

261
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:45,430
else. So these include
cranial nerve 1,

262
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:48,290
cranial nerve 2, and
cranial nerve 8. So

263
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:50,550
olfactory, optic, and
vestibulocochlear.

264
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:52,970
And these nerves
are associated with

265
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,930
special senses in
the head and neck.

266
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,290
the other way or the
other group that you

267
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:01,710
can create is cranial
nerves that provide

268
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:05,490
only somatic motor
fibers so these

269
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:08,470
include the nerves
that provide movement

270
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:11,390
in the eye so ocular
motor nerve, cochlear

271
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:14,790
nerve, and abducens
and also accessory

272
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:17,710
nerves and hypoglossal
nerves that provide

273
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:21,960
motor innervation
to the trapezius

274
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:25,310
sternocleidomastoid
as well as the tongue

275
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:29,410
and then finally we
have the third category

276
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:31,630
so these are
branchiomeric nerves you

277
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:33,650
don't need to know the
name but that means

278
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:35,970
they're derived from
pharyngeal arches which

279
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:38,190
we'll cover in the head
and neck embryology

280
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:41,730
lecture for what they
are but these nerves

281
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:45,350
so cranial nerve 5
7 9 and 10 these are

282
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:47,890
going to be relatively
complex nerves because

283
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,950
they're going to
provide a lot of

284
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:52,430
different functions. So
these will probably be

285
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:55,610
the hardest ones to
study for, but get

286
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:57,810
started on starting to
learn their functions.

287
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:03,920
So here's an example
exam question. So a

288
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,730
NYIT comm student
is about to get her

289
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:07,970
wisdom teeth pulled.
Which of the following

290
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:09,610
cranial nerves should
be targeted for

291
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:12,170
local anesthesia.
So think about what

292
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:15,410
provides sensory
innervation to the teeth.

293
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:33,410
So the answer is
pigeminal nerve or

294
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:35,530
cranial nerve
five, because that

295
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:37,750
division or branch
off of that will

296
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,730
provide sensory
innervation to all the

297
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:42,650
teeth, both upper
and lower rows.

298
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:49,330
So for the lecture on
introduction to the

299
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:51,870
head and neck, these
are some of the high

300
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,450
yield topics that
you should focus on

301
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:55,670
when you're studying.
So the first one is to

302
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,550
understand the
anatomical organization

303
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:01,010
of the skeletal, nervous,
vascular, digestive,

304
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:03,750
and respiratory
systems, and how these

305
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:07,970
changes from newborns
to adult for the

306
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:09,710
ones that I've shown
you in the lectures.

307
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:13,270
Also know the three
danger zones in the

308
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:15,230
head and neck and why
they're dangerous.

309
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,910
Also know the locations
and functions of

310
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,850
the organs that only
exist in the head and

311
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:23,210
the neck, including
glands and then know

312
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:26,050
the names fiber types
and functions and

313
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,910
the cranial exits for
each of the cranial

314
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:31,110
nerves and then finally
pay attention to

315
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:32,730
the clinical correlates
that i went over

316
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:36,750
in my lecture finally
extra set of tips

317
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,710
so head and neck is
definitely difficult

318
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:41,110
uh region to study
there's a lot packed

319
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:44,450
into a fairly small
space but don't panic

320
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:48,120
start one by one and
one way you can focus

321
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:52,010
on, you know, which
topics to study is to

322
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:54,250
go through the CPG
learning objectives.

323
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,490
And what you can also
do is start learning

324
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:59,130
the cranial nerves,
which is vitally

325
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:02,410
important for this
region. So this week,

326
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:04,510
I highly recommend
just getting

327
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:07,210
comfortable with the
names and the numbers of

328
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:09,250
each of the cranial
nerves. And then

329
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,570
next week, start
learning at least one of

330
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,310
the functions of of
each cranial nerve.

331
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:15,810
And then beyond that,
just keep learning

332
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:17,590
all the functions
that will be covered

333
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:19,610
in subsequent lectures
in more detail.

334
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,950
This is the end of
the FOM lecture on the

335
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:26,010
introduction to the
head and neck. I would

336
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:28,150
