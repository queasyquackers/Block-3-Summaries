1
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:04,410
This is Foundations
of Osteopathic

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:05,890
Medicine lecture
on head and neck

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:08,770
embryology, given
by Dr. Aki Watanabe.

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,910
Just like my
previous lecture on

5
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,470
introduction to
the head and neck,

6
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:16,530
the same rules
apply for my slides.

7
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:19,070
So any red text on
slides mean that

8
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:21,790
they're fair game
for the exam,

9
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,550
as well as anatomical
structures that are

10
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:26,910
labeled either in red
or in red highlight.

11
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:30,050
and make sure to
pay attention to

12
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:31,350
any of the
clinical correlates

13
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:33,010
that I go over
during my lectures.

14
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:36,310
And finally, I highly
recommend going over

15
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:38,210
the learning objectives
that I list in the

16
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,190
course preparation
guide for this lecture,

17
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,450
which will give you the
topics you should focus

18
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,590
on when studying for
the lecture content.

19
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,580
So here's a video
showing the remarkable

20
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,320
changes that happen
in the head and

21
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,340
neck during development.
So this is about

22
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,920
a 30-second clip that
goes to the journey

23
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,100
of four to five
-week-old embryo to

24
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,040
14 weeks. So this is
showing the changes

25
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,560
that's happening in
the head and neck

26
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,740
during essentially
the first trimester.

27
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:22,870
So during the lecture,
we'll be talking

28
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:24,510
about some of the
processes that are

29
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:26,910
involved in this
incredible transformation.

30
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:29,130
So in the first part
of this lecture,

31
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,870
we'll talk about the
segmented structures

32
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,850
in the head and
neck. And then in the

33
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,450
second part, we'll
talk about the rebels

34
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:37,630
that go against these
segmented regions.

35
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,630
And then the third
and the last part,

36
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,880
we'll talk about the
germ layer contributions

37
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:43,690
to the head and
neck structures.

38
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:45,430
So these include
the ectoderm,

39
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:48,090
endoderm, mesoderm,
and neurocrestal

40
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,250
derivatives that
exist in the head.

41
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:54,570
So let's start talking

42
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,010
about segmented
structures.

43
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:58,050
And so if you
look at somebody's

44
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,790
head or face, it's
hard to figure

45
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:02,290
out any segmented
structures.

46
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:05,200
But if you look at
the postcranium,

47
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,650
you do see some segmented

48
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:08,250
structures, as you
talked about probably

49
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,330
in previous
embryology lectures.

50
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,010
For example, when
you pay attention to

51
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:14,830
the vertebrae and the
ribs, you can clearly

52
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:17,970
see segmented
structures and system of

53
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,610
organization that
happens in the body.

54
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:23,010
So what about the head?

55
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,090
Well, in order to
look at segments

56
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:26,750
that occur in
the head, we need

57
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,510
to pay attention
to early embryos.

58
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:32,290
So when you look at
the top row, which

59
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,650
shows embryos around
four to five weeks

60
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,850
across different
animals, do you see any

61
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:39,590
segmented structures
around the head?

62
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:49,150
Here they are. And
you might have seen

63
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:52,450
these knobs that are
coming off of the neck

64
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:55,550
of the embryo. So
there are four to six

65
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,730
pharyngeal arches that
exist in early embryos

66
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:01,670
of different animals.
In humans, there

67
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:04,830
are four that are very
visible but they're

68
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,730
actually six pharyngeal
arches in the

69
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:08,730
beginning but we understand
a little bit about

70
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,830
the fifth arch which
tends to disappear

71
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,190
and then the fourth is
very closely related

72
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,890
to six so you can
consider them four and

73
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:19,290
six arches to be together
so in total there

74
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:21,570
are four visible
pharyngeal arches on the

75
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:25,450
external surface of
the embryo and these

76
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:27,990
are called pharyngeal
or brachial arches.

77
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:33,830
Here at the center
of the slide,

78
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:35,130
you see a cross-sectional

79
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:37,350
image of an embryo,
which is cut

80
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:40,770
basically where the
blue line is on this

81
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:43,350
top right inset
image. And so we're

82
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:45,990
looking down from the
top of this embryo.

83
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,030
And you'll notice
that pharyngeal

84
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,810
arches are just
part of this

85
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,530
larger pharyngeal
apparatus.

86
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:54,390
So arches are
the evaginated

87
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:57,450
segments of the ectoderm.

88
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:02,130
And there are pharyngeal
clefts that represent

89
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:05,090
the invagination of
the ectoderm, and

90
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:08,310
they exist between two
adjacent pharyngeal

91
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:11,470
arches. Similarly,
there's the pharyngeal

92
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:14,730
pouch, which is the
invagination of the endoderm

93
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:18,510
that's within the
embryo. And then between

94
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,810
the cleft and the
pouch is the pharyngeal

95
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:23,470
membrane. And these
are numbered from

96
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:26,670
cranial to caudal
direction. So the first arch

97
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:30,010
will have pharyngeal
arch one, and then

98
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:32,190
posterior to that will
be the pharyngeal cleft

99
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:34,990
one and pharyngeal
pouch one over here,

100
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:38,430
and then pharyngeal
membrane one in between.

101
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,970
what's important to
know is that these

102
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:46,870
pharyngeal apparatus
and these segments are

103
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:50,790
all associated for
with four derivative

104
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,270
structures so these
include bones and

105
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:57,530
cartilage arteries
cranial nerves and muscles

106
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:02,430
so where do the
pharyngeal apparatus go

107
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:05,430
in adults well when
you look at fish

108
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,170
and sharks for example
on the left, the

109
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:10,470
structures that
derive from pharyngeal

110
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:13,650
arches and pharyngeal
apparatus is associated

111
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:15,050
with these gills
that you see on

112
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:17,270
the sides of the head
and neck in fishes

113
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:19,690
and sharks. So they're
organs that are

114
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:22,250
involved with
respiration and feeding.

115
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,750
And in non-fish animals,

116
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:29,230
for example, other
mammals and birds, for

117
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:32,810
example, and lizards,
we obviously don't

118
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:35,890
have gills. but
the structures that

119
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:37,910
are derived from these
pharyngeal apparatus

120
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:41,270
are still involved
heavily with feeding

121
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,770
and respiration
and humans actually

122
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:46,310
have co-opted these
derivative structures

123
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:48,990
as facial muscles and
vocalizations adding

124
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:51,370
more functionality
to the structures

125
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:54,030
that come from these
pharyngeal arches.

126
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,330
So in previous
embryology lectures you

127
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,790
learned about
somites which are

128
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:07,170
packets of mesoderms
that you can see

129
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:11,090
lined up along the
anterior to posterior

130
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:14,090
axis or the body
axis of an embryo.

131
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:16,890
In the head, there are
similar structures,

132
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:18,410
but these are
called somitomeres.

133
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:21,890
And these are
units of mesoderm

134
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:24,110
in the head, but
compared to somites

135
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,610
that you see
them distinctly,

136
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:28,760
the distinction
is not as clear in

137
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,410
somitomeres. So they're
not as separated,

138
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:32,250
which you can see
of this image below.

139
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:37,430
And you can see
that the somitomeres

140
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:41,330
are responsible
for creating

141
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:44,070
mesodermal structures
in the head and

142
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,350
the neck. So let's
start with on the

143
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:47,870
anterior side.
So the first few

144
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:51,270
somitomeres will be used
to create extraocular

145
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,510
muscles. So
these are muscles

146
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,410
that are responsible
for eye movement.

147
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:59,010
And the more posterior
somitomeres will be

148
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:02,050
responsible for going
into the pharyngeal

149
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:06,650
arches to make mesodermal
structures, especially

150
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,070
the muscles that
are associated with

151
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:11,290
these pharyngeal arches.
And what's neat is

152
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:13,410
that the tongue, although
this is a structure

153
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:16,790
that exists in the
head, they are created

154
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:19,690
from mesodermal packets,
the somites, from

155
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:22,930
more posterior part of
the body. And this is

156
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:25,130
why the innervation of
the tongue, the motor

157
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:28,230
innervation, I should
say, is coming from

158
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:31,570
the most posterior
cranial nerve, which is

159
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:34,310
cranial nerve 12, or
the hypoglossal nerve.

160
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:39,750
And the arteries
are also originally

161
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,070
very segmented
in embryos.

162
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:46,370
So you have the
arches, and you can see

163
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:48,170
on the left in this
oblique view of an

164
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:51,070
embryo that there are
clearly defined arteries

165
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,830
that are based on
these pharyngeal

166
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:56,870
arches. But during
development, arches one,

167
00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:00,170
two, and five mostly
disappear, and the

168
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:04,170
other arches change
shape. So the segmented

169
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:07,110
starting point
for these arteries

170
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:09,990
become kind of lost.
So you don't really

171
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,150
see these segmented
structures or

172
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:14,770
organizations when
you look at arteries

173
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:16,870
of a baby and
adults and humans.

174
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:22,690
So now, as with
the cranial nerves

175
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:24,150
that I went over
in my introduction

176
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,390
to head and neck lecture,

177
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:27,590
I recommend creating
another table

178
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,610
to organize the
derivatives coming

179
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,250
off of the
pharyngeal apparatus.

180
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:35,710
So on the leftmost
column, you can have

181
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:38,950
the arches. So arch
number one, two, three,

182
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,530
and then you can
put the four and six

183
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:43,390
together. And remember
that five is missing

184
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:46,490
and disappears during
development. it.

185
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:50,350
So the first arch
is also called the

186
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:52,770
mandibular arch. The
second is also called

187
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:55,630
hyoid arch. Third is
also called carotid.

188
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:58,290
Fourth and sixth are
called systemic and

189
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:01,270
pulmonary arches
respectively. And as I

190
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:03,610
mentioned before,
each of these arches

191
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,490
are associated with
bone and cartilage

192
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:09,710
structures, muscles,
arteries, and cranial

193
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:11,650
nerves. And after
I've gone through the

194
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:14,130
pharyngeal arch
derivatives, I'll also go

195
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:16,830
over the derivatives
coming off of the

196
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:19,690
pharyngeal pouches,
clefts, and membranes.

197
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:24,050
So just like bingo,
you get some free

198
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:26,090
space. So actually,
you can block

199
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:28,990
out two of the
spaces. So arch number

200
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,950
one and two do
not contribute

201
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:34,430
significantly to
any of the arteries.

202
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,050
so let's start with
the pharyngeal arch

203
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:41,950
one also called the
mandibular arch so the

204
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:44,490
cartilaginous and
bony derivatives of

205
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:48,110
the mandibular arch
includes the cartilaginous

206
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:50,970
precursor of the
bony mandible this

207
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:53,690
is also called meccal's
cartilage and so

208
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:55,640
the pharyngeal arch
one does not directly

209
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,730
create the bony
mandible but rather it

210
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:01,870
creates the cartilaginous
scaffold that will

211
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:04,270
help the bony mandible
form around it.

212
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:09,010
It also is responsible
for creating the

213
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:12,330
malleus and incus
bones. And so these

214
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:17,510
are the hammer-like
bone and the incus or

215
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,830
the anvil-shaped bone.
And these are tiny

216
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:21,930
bones in the middle
ear, and these help

217
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:24,130
amplify sound so
you can hear better.

218
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,850
And so you might be
wondering, well, this

219
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:30,070
is a mandibular arch,
so it must be related

220
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:33,450
to the lower jaw. So
why are bones that are

221
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:36,190
inside of your ear
associated with this

222
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:39,570
arch? Well, there's a
neat evolutionary story

223
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:42,330
here. And that's
because the malleus and

224
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:46,430
the incus bones used
to be jaw bones in more

225
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:49,170
primitive and ancestral
mammals. And you

226
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,870
see this in other non
-mammalian animals as

227
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:55,050
well. So when you take
a look at fossils of

228
00:10:55,050 --> 00:11:00,170
mammal ancestors, you
see that the quadrate

229
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:03,470
and articular have
become decoupled from

230
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:06,390
the jaws and they have
slowly moved in to

231
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:11,650
the middle ear and this
transition evolutionary

232
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:15,290
transition could be
seen by looking at

233
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:17,790
a series of fossils
going from the most

234
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:21,950
primitive mammals or
mammal relative all the

235
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:24,470
way to modern mammals
which is a neat story.

236
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:27,730
And that's why the
malleus and incus are

237
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,970
the derivatives of
pharyngeal arch one.

238
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,310
So now let's talk
about the arterial

239
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:35,070
derivatives. Well,
actually, I told

240
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,600
you this is one of
the free spaces.

241
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:40,050
And although the
arch one contributes

242
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:42,830
to parts of the
maxillary artery and

243
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:45,690
external carotid
artery, it's too

244
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:49,330
significant to be
included in the table.

245
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:50,990
So no need to know
that for the exam.

246
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,390
In terms of the muscle
derivatives, you

247
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:55,810
have muscles of
mastication or also known

248
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:57,630
as jaw muscles. So
these are muscles

249
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,590
responsible for opening
and closing your

250
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,830
jaw for chewing. So
these include the

251
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:04,270
temporalis muscle,
masseter muscle, and the

252
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:06,510
pterygoids. You also
have several other

253
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:10,110
muscles. So tensor
tympani, which tenses

254
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:13,350
the tympanic membrane
or the eardrum,

255
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:16,670
tensor villi palatini,
an anterior belly of

256
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:19,510
the digastric muscle,
and then myelohyoid.

257
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:25,410
and what is the cranial
nerve associated

258
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,090
with these
muscles? Well, it's

259
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:30,190
cranial nerve five
or the trigeminal.

260
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,790
Now we'll move on to
pharyngeal arch two,

261
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:36,870
also known as
hired arch and the

262
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:39,950
cartilaginous and bony
structures that derive

263
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:41,950
from pharyngeal arch
two includes the

264
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:45,890
stapes bone, which
is the third middle

265
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:50,690
ear ossicles, and the
stylo process, which

266
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:53,630
the stylofaryngous
muscle attaches to.

267
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:56,780
And then you
have the hyoid or

268
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,330
parts of the hyoid,
including the

269
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:00,230
lesser horn and
the upper body.

270
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:02,470
And again, this is one of

271
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:04,050
the free spaces
for arteries.

272
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,650
So you don't need
to know for the

273
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:08,830
exam, but it
forms part of the

274
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,690
stapedio arteries
and embryos, but

275
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,650
that disappears
during development.

276
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:19,270
And then in
terms of muscles,

277
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:22,010
the pharyngeal arch 2

278
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:24,370
creates the
muscles of facial

279
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:28,210
expression, the
stapedius muscle that

280
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:30,270
holds on to the
stapes, and the

281
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:32,190
posterior belly
of the digastric.

282
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:34,390
And so what nerve
is responsible

283
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:36,010
for facial
expression muscles?

284
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:38,150
Well, it's the cranial

285
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,410
nerve 7 or the
facial nerve.

286
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:46,190
moving forward now
we're on to pharyngeal

287
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:48,250
arch 3 also known
as the carotid

288
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:52,610
arch and the cartilaginous
and bone structure

289
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:55,030
that derives from
it include the hyoid

290
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:57,950
and parts of the hyoid
which is the greater

291
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:00,470
horn and the lower
body so both the

292
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:03,310
pharyngeal arch 2 and 3
contribute to the formation

293
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:05,370
of the hyoid but
different parts of it

294
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:09,930
In terms of arteries,
it creates the

295
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:12,190
internal and external
carotid arteries.

296
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:18,610
And for muscles, it
leads to the creation of

297
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:21,590
stylopharyngous muscles.
And then the cranial

298
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:23,690
nerve that innervates
this muscle is the

299
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:26,950
glossopharyngeal nerve
or cranial nerve nine.

300
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,690
And it also makes
sense when you think

301
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:30,670
about what we learned
in my previous lecture,

302
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:33,350
where the carotid body
and the carotid sinus

303
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:36,350
is innervated by the

304
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,630
glossopharyngeal nerve.

305
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,290
Let's move on to
pharyngeal arch number

306
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:46,130
four also known as
systemic arch and the

307
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:47,970
cartilaginous and
bony structure here

308
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,890
includes the laryngeal
cartilages except for

309
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,710
the epiglottis and so
this is formed together

310
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:55,750
with the pharyngeal
arch number six.

311
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:01,070
In terms of arteries
it forms parts of

312
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:03,530
the aorta and the
right subclavian artery

313
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:05,660
And so what about
the left subclavian?

314
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:09,070
Well, that's formed
from what's considered

315
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:12,290
seventh arch, but it's
not discussed here

316
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:17,840
any further because
it's a very poorly

317
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:23,150
known arch in the
pharyngeal apparatus.

318
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:28,530
And in terms of
the muscles, it's

319
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:29,770
responsible for
creating the

320
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:32,270
cricothyroid, levator
veli palatini,

321
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:34,610
constrictors of the
pharynx, and the

322
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:36,490
strident muscles
of the esophagus.

323
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:39,250
And these muscles
are associated with

324
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:42,650
the vagus nerve,
which is cranial nerve

325
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,230
10. And pharyngeal
arch 4 actually

326
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:48,250
is responsible for
the superior laryngeal

327
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,610
branch or the
nerve of the vagus.

328
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:56,490
Now, the pharyngeal
arch six, also known

329
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:59,630
as pulmonary arch,
again, just like

330
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,330
what I've shown
you in the previous

331
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:03,850
slide, together with
pharyngeal arch four,

332
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:06,170
it's responsible
for the laryngeal

333
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:08,190
cartilages, except
for the epiglottis.

334
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,670
And it forms part of

335
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:11,890
the pulmonary arteries.

336
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,850
And in terms of
the muscles, it's

337
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,430
responsible for the
intrinsic laryngeal muscles.

338
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:22,210
that's actually,
it's one of its

339
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:24,710
functions is to allow
me to talk like this.

340
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:28,790
And the nerve that's
responsible for

341
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:31,330
that is the vagus
nerve, specifically

342
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:33,090
the recurrent
laryngeal nerve.

343
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,930
And so this is a
nice diagram that

344
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:41,490
summarizes the key
structures that are

345
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:43,230
derived from each
laryngeal arch, which

346
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:45,110
are color-coded by
the arch number.

347
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:47,830
And it doesn't include
arteries, but it

348
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:49,570
shows a lot of the
other derivatives.

349
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:53,930
So just to recap,
ARCH1 is responsible

350
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,170
for the meccalus
cartilage, which is that

351
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:59,850
cartilaginous precursor
to the lower jaw.

352
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:02,390
And also is responsible

353
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,090
for the malleus
and incus.

354
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,290
And those are the bony
and the cartilaginous

355
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:10,290
structures. and it's
also associated with

356
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,710
cranial nerve five or
trigeminal nerve that

357
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:14,570
innervates the jaw
muscles and several

358
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:16,730
other muscles as well
including the temporalis

359
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:20,490
muscle and the
masseter muscle and the

360
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:23,190
anterior body belly of
the digastric muscle.

361
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:27,950
Arch two is responsible
for the styloid

362
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:31,650
process, the stapes
which is another

363
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,030
ear bone and part of
the hyoid specifically

364
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:36,630
the lesser horn
and the upper body.

365
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:40,430
And it is associated
cranial nerve seven

366
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:42,170
that innervates the
muscles, the facial

367
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:45,950
expression, and
several others as well.

368
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:50,590
Arch three in blue,
the cartilage in

369
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:52,730
this arch forms
part of the hyoid,

370
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:55,250
more specifically
the greater horn of

371
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,310
the higher bone
in the lower body.

372
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:04,090
And the cranial nerve 9,
or the glossopharyngeal

373
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:06,190
nerve, is the one
that innervates the

374
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:09,110
stylopharyngeus muscle,
which is misspelled

375
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:12,310
on this image. It
should be STY, not STI.

376
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:15,220
And finally,
we have ARCH4.

377
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:19,390
And the cartilage
that forms from ARCH4

378
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:22,230
includes the thyroid
and cricoid cartilages,

379
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:25,270
so part of the laryngeal
cartilages, and it's

380
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,890
associated with the
vagus nerve, is more

381
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:30,710
specifically the
superior laryngeal nerve.

382
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:36,570
And this innervates
the pharyngeal muscles.

383
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:40,310
This is another
diagram that organizes

384
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:43,810
the structures by
anatomical systems, so by

385
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:46,190
nerves, muscles, and
cartilage in bone.

386
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:49,470
So once again,
arch one is

387
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:51,170
associated with
trigeminal nerve,

388
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:53,490
arch two with
the facial nerve,

389
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:55,250
arch three with the
glossopharyngeal

390
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,270
nerve, and arch
four and six

391
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,110
are both associated
with the vagus.

392
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:03,790
In terms of muscles,
arch one is associated

393
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:05,390
with muscles of
mastication or the

394
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:07,390
jaw opening and
closing muscles and

395
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:10,790
other muscles. Arch
two with muscles of

396
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:12,930
the facial expression
and several others.

397
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:14,810
Arch three with
the stylopharyngeus

398
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:17,190
muscle and arch four
and six with the

399
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,710
muscles of the larynx
and the esophagus.

400
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:22,110
In terms of
cartilaginous and bony

401
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:24,430
structures, Arch one
is associated with

402
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:27,190
mandible, malleus,
and incus. Arch

403
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:29,410
two with the hyoid,
the upper portion,

404
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:32,930
stapes, and the styler
process. Arch three

405
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:35,490
with the hyoid and
the lower portion of

406
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:38,490
the hyoid. And then
arch four and six are

407
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:41,050
associated with the
laryngeal cartilagous.

408
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,470
so we covered the
derivatives of the pharyngeal

409
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:47,750
arches and so now
we're ready to move

410
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,530
into the derivatives
of the other parts of

411
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:53,310
the pharyngeal
apparatus which includes

412
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:58,110
the cleft pouches and
the membranes and just

413
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:00,130
to help out with the
visualization recall

414
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:04,590
that the pouch is the
invagination of the

415
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:07,650
endoderm so what
that looks like three

416
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:10,450
-dimensionally so this
is a high this is a side

417
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:14,690
view of an embryo where
the pharyngeal arch

418
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:17,190
and membrane have
been removed so this

419
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:19,530
the gray is endodermal
layer and you can see

420
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:21,830
the out pocketings
of the endoderm layer

421
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:24,970
and this is what causes
the pouches to form

422
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:30,630
what makes it easier
to study is that of

423
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,730
the clefts and membranes
one through four

424
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:35,110
only the first one
contributes to adult

425
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:37,010
structures so you have
the pharyngeal cleft

426
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:40,370
here that becomes the
external auditory meatus.

427
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:42,970
And then the
pharyngeal membrane one

428
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:46,110
becomes a tympanic
membrane or your eardrum.

429
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:50,070
And so clefts and
membranes two, three, and

430
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:52,990
four do not contribute
to any adult structures,

431
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:55,750
which keeps it
simple. So in fact,

432
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,810
clefts two, three, and
four becomes invaginated

433
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:01,490
and joined together to
make a larger sinus,

434
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:04,490
the cervical sinus, which
becomes obliterated.

435
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:06,470
But when it doesn't,
it can lead to

436
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:08,590
fistula and cysts, which
we'll talk about in

437
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:10,970
our clinical call
section in a little bit.

438
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,150
So let's start with
pharyngeal pouch

439
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:18,990
cleft and membrane
derivatives from the

440
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:21,290
first pouch cleft
and membranes. And so

441
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:24,450
cleft one becomes
external auditory meatus,

442
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,790
and membrane one
becomes a tympanic

443
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:28,610
membrane or the
eardrum, which we just

444
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:31,190
covered. And then
pouch one becomes the

445
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:34,030
tympanic cavity plus
the eustachian tube

446
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:38,090
that's going to lead
into the nasopharynx.

447
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:45,230
Pharyngeal pouch
two, since we don't

448
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:48,990
have to worry about
the cleft or the

449
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:51,550
membrane, is that
pouch two becomes the

450
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:54,290
palatine tonsils. And
so tonsils are masses

451
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:56,690
of lymphoid tissue
and it traps

452
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,630
bacteria and viruses
entering the oral

453
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:01,870
cavity. And it also
produces antibodies to

454
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:03,950
help protect them
from the infection.

455
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:07,150
Now let's talk about
pharyngeal pouches

456
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:09,030
three and four and the
derivatives. You can

457
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:11,510
package pouch three and
four together because

458
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:14,330
their derivatives
consist of glandular

459
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:16,210
tissue that exists in
the deep neck that we

460
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,570
talked about in the
previous lecture. So

461
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:21,510
in the pouch three, the
cranial portion gives

462
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:23,870
rise to the inferior
parathyroid gland,

463
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:28,070
and the caudal portion
becomes the thymus.

464
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:31,950
And pouch four, the
cranial portion becomes

465
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:34,930
the superior hair
thyroid gland, and

466
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:37,530
then the caudal portion
becomes what's called

467
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:40,400
the ultimobranchial
body, which is

468
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,210
misspelled here. It's
missing an N in this

469
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:46,210
illustration,
ultimobranchial body. and it

470
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:49,270
gives rise to
parafollicular, also called

471
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:55,450
C-cells, and these
cells secrete calcitonin

472
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:58,590
and calcitonin acts
to reduce calcium

473
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:00,210
in the blood. So
it's another way of

474
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:02,970
controlling the level
of calcium in the body.

475
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:08,530
Now let's talk about
clinical correlates.

476
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:10,450
And so this is about
the brachial fistula

477
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:12,590
and cysts. So this
is pretty rare,

478
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:15,210
but it's good to know
what is caused by

479
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:17,930
that cervical cyst
remaining throughout

480
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:20,870
development. So normally
the cervical cyst

481
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:23,230
formed from pouches
two through four

482
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:26,550
gets obliterated, but
if they remain and

483
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:29,010
if there is an opening
into the external

484
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:32,190
environment, you
end up with openings

485
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,410
occurring along the
anterior margin of the

486
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:37,930
sternocleidomastoid
muscle, which you

487
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:40,490
can see on a patient
on the right here.

488
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:43,710
On the other hand, if
the cervical cyst has

489
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:45,770
an opening internally,
then it typically

490
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:48,570
follows the location
of the patine tonsils.

491
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:50,690
So you'll see an opening
inside of the mouth

492
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:53,490
at the location of
the patine tonsils. So

493
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:03,140
this is an illustration,
a drawing that

494
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,170
shows kind of a three
-dimensional configuration

495
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:07,920
of the pouches and
the derivatives, which

496
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,860
might help you
visualize and understand

497
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:13,600
the derivatives and
their relative locations,

498
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,320
a little bit better
than flat images.

499
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,000
So we have the first
pharyngeal pouch here

500
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,560
that becomes the
internal eustachian tube

501
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,020
and the middle ear or
the tympanic cavity.

502
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,660
You have the second
pharyngeal pouch that

503
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:30,340
becomes the site of
the palatine tonsils.

504
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:32,680
And then moving on to
the third pharyngeal

505
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,320
pouch, the cranial
portion becomes the

506
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,600
inferior parathyroid
gland, and then the

507
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,840
caudal portion becomes
the thymus. And then

508
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,020
finally, the pharyngeal
pouch forward, the

509
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,940
cranial portion
becomes the

510
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:48,560
superior parathyroid
gland, and the

511
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,420
caudal portion becomes

512
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,980
the ultimobranchial body.

513
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,160
Now that we're
done with the first

514
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,480
part of this
lecture, we're

515
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,680
ready for an example
exam question.

516
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,760
So a toddler has a
hearing defect. MRI

517
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,200
scans show that
the toddler has

518
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,720
developmental defects
in auditory or the

519
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,180
eustachian tube and
the tympanic cavity.

520
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:12,140
Which pharyngeal
apparatus component

521
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:15,560
mostly likely developed
abnormally? The

522
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:26,750
answer here is B,
pharyngeal pouch 1.

523
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:29,070
The derivatives
of pharyngeal

524
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,590
pouch 1 include
the tympanic

525
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:32,850
cavity and the
eustachian tube.

1
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:05,110
This is part two
of the FOM lecture

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:06,840
on head and
neck embryology.

3
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:09,910
This is going to
be on structures

4
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:11,190
that deviate from the

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:12,870
segmented pharyngeal
structures.

6
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:18,170
We'll start off
with the tongue.

7
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:20,270
So tongue
development traverses

8
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,550
multiple pharyngeal
arches, hence

9
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:25,350
why they have
complex innervations.

10
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,850
So when you look at
the figure up the

11
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:33,810
top row, you see
that pharyngeal

12
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:40,390
arch 1 extends as it
grows and forms the

13
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:42,150
anterior two-thirds
of the tongue.

14
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:46,970
When you look at
arch 2, you see that

15
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:51,650
arch 3 begins to
overgrow over arch

16
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:54,210
2. So arch 2 essentially
disappears, at

17
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,990
least from the
external surface of

18
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:58,490
the tongue, but
still provides taste

19
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:00,670
innervation to the
anterior two-thirds.

20
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,050
And arch 3 and 4
form the mucosa of

21
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:06,970
the posterior one
-third of the tongue.

22
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:12,150
and tongue muscles
that form and are

23
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,090
underlying these
external surfaces in the

24
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,370
mucosa are formed from
the occipital somites

25
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,050
which I mentioned
towards the beginning

26
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:22,150
of this lecture and
that's why cranial

27
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:24,190
nerve 12 provides
the motor innervation

28
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:26,610
which is the caudal
most cranial nerve

29
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,730
and this makes
sense when you think

30
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:33,210
about the complex
sensory innervation

31
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:36,670
to the tongue so So
anterior two-thirds,

32
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:42,110
the somatic sensory
innervation is

33
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:43,850
provided by cranial
nerve 5, which

34
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:45,810
is associated with
pharyngeal arch 1.

35
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,190
And then the
taste for anterior

36
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,810
two-thirds of the
tongue is provided

37
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,270
by cranial nerve
7, or facial.

38
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:58,290
And then pharyngeal
arch 3 provides the

39
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:02,490
mucosal and the taste
innervation for the

40
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,330
posterior one-third of
the tongue. And that's

41
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:07,650
why both the somatic
sensory and the special

42
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:10,610
taste sensory innervation
is provided by the

43
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:12,870
glossopharyngeal nerve
for the posterior

44
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,770
one-third of the tongue.
And then even more

45
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:18,630
posterior to that,
both the taste and the

46
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:21,630
somatic sensory
innervation is provided by

47
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:25,450
the vagus nerve, which
comes from arch four.

48
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:32,470
Next up is thyroid.
thyroid and thyroid

49
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:35,070
originates from the
single outpouching of

50
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:38,830
endoderm shown here on
the ventral side between

51
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:41,850
arches one and two
and this is called

52
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:44,090
the thyroid diverticulum
and diverticulum

53
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:47,330
just means an outpocketing
and this exists

54
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:50,650
if you go back one slide
at the foramen cecum

55
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:54,750
which is between the
area of the tongue

56
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,890
that's formed by arch
one and arch three.

57
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:01,450
Now let's talk about
thyroid development.

58
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:04,110
So the thyroid originates
from the single

59
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:07,030
outpocketing on the
endoderm on the ventral

60
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,750
side between arches
one and two. So if you

61
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,930
go back one slide, you
can see this foramen

62
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:17,750
cecum that exists
between the area of the

63
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,690
tongue formed by arch
one and arch three.

64
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:25,190
and so remember that
diverticulum means

65
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:27,490
outpocketing so this is
just a small outpocketing

66
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:29,490
that will eventually
become the thyroid

67
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:33,170
gland and during
development as the

68
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:36,010
embryo and the tongue
grow the developing

69
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:39,490
thyroid gland descends
down the neck so it

70
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:41,570
starts out as a thyroid
primordium or the

71
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:45,030
diverticulum but it
starts to descend through

72
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,590
the neck passing
through the developing

73
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:50,150
higher bone and laryngeal
cartilages. And as

74
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:53,270
it goes down, it
generates or produces this

75
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:56,470
narrow duct called
a thyroglossal duct.

76
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:00,530
And as it continues
or the thyroid

77
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,410
gland continues
downward, it's

78
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,690
going to create a
longer thyroglossal

79
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:08,390
duct along the
midline anterior

80
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:15,110
side of the neck and
after a while the

81
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:18,190
thyroglossal duct
degenerates and then

82
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,890
what only what
remains is the opening

83
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:25,750
pit of the thyroglossal
duct called the

84
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,170
foramen cecum which
we saw on one of the

85
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:30,970
previous slides and
this figure shows

86
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:35,090
the pathway that the
thyroglossal duct

87
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,470
took towards the
thyroid gland.

88
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:44,050
So clinical correlate
related to the

89
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:47,470
thyroglossal duct is what
happens when this duct

90
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,940
does not close up
or does not get

91
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,340
obliterated. That will
lead to the thyroglossal

92
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:55,510
duct sinus or thyroglossal
duct cyst. And

93
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,070
the difference between
the two is that

94
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:00,270
thyroduct cyst, let's
start with there in the

95
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:03,730
middle of the slide,
is there will be a

96
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:07,910
cavity or cyst that
remains because the

97
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:10,610
thyroglossal duct did
not seal up properly.

98
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:13,850
On the other hand,
thyroglossal duct cyst

99
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:16,790
forms, or excuse me,
thyroglossal duct

100
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:19,850
sinus forms when
there's an opening to

101
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:23,410
an external environment.
And both the cyst

102
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:27,150
and sinus pose a risk
because infection

103
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:30,590
can start and spread
within the cyst.

104
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:34,550
So keep in mind that
thyroglossal duct

105
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,990
cyst forms along
the midline of the

106
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:43,850
neck, not lateral like
the branchial cysts.

107
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:48,670
So make sure that
you pay attention

108
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,950
to the location of
this opening to decide

109
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,410
whether it is due
to the thyroglossal

110
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:57,930
duct cyst or sinus
or branchial cyst.

111
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,450
The third clinical
correlate related to the

112
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:08,410
thyroid gland and the
thyroglossal duct is

113
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:11,190
an ectopic thyroid
gland. And this is fairly

114
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:13,850
common. And the most
common presence or

115
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:17,250
presentation of this is
the pyramidal lobe, which

116
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:20,470
is a little extension
along the midline of

117
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:22,290
the thyroid gland so
the thyroid gland is

118
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:25,230
usually h-shaped but
sometimes you'll see

119
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:28,210
this extension along the
midline pointing upwards

120
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:31,030
and this is called
the pyramidal lobe and

121
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:36,530
this is just the thyroid
gland growing along

122
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:40,030
just the short end portion
of the phyroglossal

123
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:43,170
duct and this is not
this does not pose

124
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:46,610
any risk to someone's
health and you might

125
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:49,950
see it on your cadaver
in the anatomy lab.

126
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:56,530
Another special
developmental process that

127
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:59,830
occurs in the head
is called placodes.

128
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:03,730
And so placodes are
ectodermal discs that

129
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:06,830
form from this thin
ectodermal layer. So when

130
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,970
the ectodermal layer
during development

131
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:12,260
invaginates, so again
forming and in-pocketing

132
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:15,090
and buds off, as you
can see on this lower

133
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:18,170
left-hand corner,
then it forms what's

134
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:20,750
called a placode. And
there are a number of

135
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:24,310
special sensory structures
that are derived

136
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,610
from placodes. So
these include the nasal

137
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,890
placode, which will
form the mucosa of the

138
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:30,990
nasal cavity. So that's
going to be closely

139
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:33,590
associated with the sense
of smell or olfaction.

140
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:36,250
The lens placode,
which forms the lens

141
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:39,350
of the eye, the otic
placode, which forms

142
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:42,650
the vestibule and
cochlea of the inner ear,

143
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:45,670
and it also forms
neurogenic placoids,

144
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:47,630
which forms parts of
the cranial nerves.

145
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:52,070
So as I mentioned,
these placodes tend

146
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:55,130
to be associated
closely with cranial

147
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:57,550
nerves and especially
special sensory nerves.

148
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,470
So nasal placode
is associated with

149
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:01,390
cranial nerve one or
the olfactory nerve.

150
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,270
Lens placode is
closely associated with

151
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:05,910
the optic nerve.
and the otic placode

152
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,830
is closely
associated with the

153
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:11,250
vestibulocochlear nerve
or cranial nerve eight.

154
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,590
Now let's talk about the

155
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:14,850
development of the face.

156
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:19,090
So the facial primordia
or the precursor to

157
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:21,810
the face begins with
three major regions. So

158
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:24,920
you have the frontal
nasal prominence here

159
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:28,630
and you have the
maxillary prominences just

160
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,830
above the stomodium
or the embryonic mouth

161
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:33,890
and then the mandibular
prominences and these

162
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:36,250
three major regions will
differentiate further

163
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:40,170
so at six weeks old
the frontal nasal

164
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:43,730
prominence will divide
into sort of the frontal

165
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:48,670
area and then the
nasal process over here

166
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:52,430
on each side of the
embryonic face so on the

167
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:56,050
lateral side this lateral
nasal process will

168
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:57,910
eventually form the
sides of the nose which

169
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,610
you can kind of follow
along in the seven

170
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:03,710
and eight weak embryos.
And then the medial

171
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:07,110
nasal process will come
together to form the

172
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:11,270
intermaxillary segment
shown here in yellow.

173
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:15,470
And this will form
the nasal septum, the

174
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:18,490
middle part of the upper
lip and the philtrum

175
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:21,410
or the medial cleft,
which you can see

176
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:23,350
here on the lower right
part of the image.

177
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,150
and then the
left and right

178
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:30,090
maxillary prominences
will come meet

179
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:32,110
the intermaxillary
prominences

180
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:34,670
to form the upper
cheek regions and

181
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:37,370
the upper lip shown
here in blue and

182
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:38,670
then the left and
right mandibular

183
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:41,290
prominences will
form the lower jaw

184
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,810
lower lip and the
lower cheek regions

185
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:49,210
so now let's take
the video that we saw

186
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:50,690
at the very beginning
of this lecture

187
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,370
and just go over
what we just learned.

188
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:57,490
So here we have the
frontal nasal prominence,

189
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:59,630
and you have the
nasal process forming

190
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:02,180
here. You have the
maxillary process here,

191
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,050
and then you have the
mandibular process

192
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:07,650
over here. And here
are the lateral and

193
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:11,110
the medial portion of
the nasal processes,

194
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,530
which is going
to meet to form

195
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,190
the intermaxillary
process.

196
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:23,190
And then those will
further develop and

197
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:26,310
differentiate to form
the face of a fetus.

198
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,610
So there's a
clinical correlate

199
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,970
associated with the
formation of the

200
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:35,450
face as well as
the hard palate.

201
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:39,310
So the palate forms
through two stages.

202
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:43,240
So we have the primary
palate, which is

203
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,130
formed from the extension
of the intermaxillary

204
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:48,910
segment. So this was
the yellow portion

205
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:52,030
that we also saw
in two slides ago

206
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:54,730
before we played the
video. And this will

207
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:57,270
form what's called,
again, the primary palate,

208
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:59,030
if you follow it
to the right of the

209
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:02,570
image. The secondary
pallet forms from

210
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:05,590
joining of the pallet
time process coming from

211
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:09,590
the maxillary
prominences in blue here.

212
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:12,230
So in this view,
we're looking

213
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:14,910
at the embryo
bottom up. So

214
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:17,270
we're looking up
at the pallet.

215
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:22,030
And by the end, both
of these pallets will

216
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:25,270
close up, forming a
unified hard pallet.

217
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:28,430
So the clinical
correlate portion comes

218
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:32,510
when there is incomplete
fusion enclosure of

219
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:35,090
the maxilla and your
palate. And this is

220
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:37,330
actually pretty common.
So occurs in about

221
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:40,930
one in 1000 births.
And the cleft lip

222
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:45,290
originates from incomplete
fusion around the

223
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:48,650
lip between the
intermaxillary segment and

224
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:51,630
the palatine process.
and the more severe

225
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:54,610
version is the cleft
palate where you have

226
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:58,370
opening within the
hard palate due to the

227
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:00,550
incomplete fusion of
the path time process

228
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:04,570
on both sides as well
as the primary palate

229
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:06,370
formed from the
intermaxillary segment.

230
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:10,250
So this results in
abnormal facial appearance

231
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:13,450
and defective speech
and nowadays it can

232
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:15,970
be treated in most cases
and involves surgery

233
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:18,010
and any therapies,
for example, speech

234
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:20,850
therapies to improve
associated conditions.

235
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:24,930
So when you have a
cleft palate, it means

236
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:27,250
that the oral and nasal
cavities are connected.

237
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,910
So that definitely
needs to be treated in

238
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:33,830
order to prevent issues
with, for example,

239
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:34,570
feeding.

240
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:40,730
Now let's talk about
skull development.

241
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:42,590
So I'm going to
go through this

242
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,890
briefly, and you do
not need to know the

243
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,750
details as on this
slide for the exam.

244
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:49,930
So you have three
embryonic components

245
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,490
that make up the
skull. So you have the

246
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:54,190
chondrocranium,
which is formed from

247
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,930
endochondral bones, so
bones that start off as

248
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:59,530
cartilage and then
transforms into bone.

249
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:02,590
So these include the
occipital, sphenoid,

250
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,790
ethmoid, and
temporal bones, at

251
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,730
least the petrous
or the hard part

252
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:09,830
where the middle and
inner ear resides.

253
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:12,130
You also have the
desmocranium, which is

254
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:16,270
the membranous bone
to the sides and tops

255
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:18,890
of the brain case,
forms the calvary.

256
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:20,970
And these include
the frontal,

257
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:24,450
occipital, and
the parietal.

258
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:29,310
Although this is shown
in blue, parts of

259
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:31,850
it should be membranous
bone in purple.

260
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:34,090
You also have
viscerocranium, which is

261
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:36,890
derived from pharyngeal
arches via, again,

262
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:39,510
membranous ossification.
So these include

263
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:42,210
the temporal bone, the
squamous part, or the

264
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:45,170
flat part, maxillabone,
zygomatic, and

265
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:47,710
the mandible bone,
shown here in the image.

266
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,690
Brain development,

267
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:54,070
similarly, you
don't need to know

268
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:56,790
anything on this
slide, but just wanted

269
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:59,250
to let you know
that the neural

270
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,570
tube, which you
should have gone over

271
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:03,490
in one of the first
embryo lectures,

272
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:08,330
becomes more differentiated
into the forebrain,

273
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,630
midbrain, and hindbrain,
and these will

274
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,370
further differentiate
into different

275
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:16,490
subdivisions of the
brain. You will cover

276
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:19,670
neuronality in more
detail next semester. But

277
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:22,060
the reason why I went
over the skull and brain

278
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,950
development, even
if it briefly, is to

279
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:26,240
talk about some important
clinical correlates

280
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,070
that is caused by
deviations from this

281
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:31,410
coordinated development
of the brain and skull

282
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:34,270
they have to develop
together but what if

283
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:39,630
it doesn't so one of
the conditions that

284
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:42,130
could occur is called
craniosynostosis and

285
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:44,750
this is deformity of
the skull due to the

286
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,410
********* closure of
the sutures which means

287
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:50,410
that the fontanelle is
closed too early and

288
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:53,270
so the type of defect
and the deformation

289
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:56,950
depends on which suture
closed prematurely.

290
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,690
Microcephaly is having
a smaller brain. It's

291
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:03,790
caused by abnormal
development of the brain

292
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:06,310
rather than anything
to do with suture

293
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:10,250
closure and timing thereof
of the skull. And it

294
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,590
often results in mental
deficiency because

295
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:14,950
it's the brain tissue
that's being affected.

296
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:18,090
And then finally, we
have hydrocephalus,

297
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:20,470
which is caused by
elevated pressure in

298
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:24,410
the brain ventricles
due to excess cerebral

299
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:27,670
spinal fluid buildup.
So this results

300
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:31,370
in larger brains, which
then pushes against

301
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:34,210
the skull during
skull development. So

302
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:36,530
this leads to this
expanded brain case

303
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:40,030
morphology. And this
is pretty common, which

304
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:43,150
occurs in one in
about thousand births.

305
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,210
And finally, in
this part, I'm going

306
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:50,070
to be talking
about pituitary and

307
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:53,190
their amazing
developmental origins.

308
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:55,550
So the pituitary,
also known as

309
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:58,810
hypothesis, is a
master endocrine gland.

310
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:02,130
And this is especially
true for growth and

311
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:04,630
reproduction. And the
anterior and posterior

312
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,770
lobes produce different
sets of hormones,

313
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,590
which you can see here,
but this is not going

314
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:11,870
to be tested, at
least for this lecture

315
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:14,370
content. So don't worry
about this for now.

316
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:17,550
But what's interesting
and what you will

317
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:20,210
get tested on is the
developmental or embryonic

318
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:23,270
origins of anterior
versus the posterior

319
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:25,690
lobe or the pituitary.
And I think it's

320
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:28,870
very neat. So what
happens is that the

321
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:33,110
anterior lobe forms
from the upgrowth of the

322
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:36,130
roof of the mouth,
which you can see here.

323
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:37,710
And this is called
the hypophysiopouch.

324
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:42,010
And then the posterior
lobe comes from

325
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:45,110
above, from the
downgrowth of the floor of

326
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:47,670
the embryonic brain,
the diencephalon.

327
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:52,150
And the brain is
originally from ectoderm.

328
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:54,290
So they're both
ectodermal in their

329
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:56,250
origins, but obviously
they're coming from

330
00:16:56,250 --> 00:17:00,870
totally different
parts or tissues, which

331
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:05,370
is remarkable. And the
anterior and posterior

332
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:07,470
lobes of the the
pituitary, while

333
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:11,010
these pouches kind
of dance together and

334
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:13,450
come together to eventually
form the anterior

335
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,810
and posterior lobes
of the pituitary.

1
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:04,350
This is part
three of the FOM

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,630
lecture on head and
neck embryology.

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,810
In this last section,
we're going to be

4
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:11,350
talking about germ
layer contributions

5
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:13,770
to various head and
neck structures.

6
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:18,590
So there are three
major germ layers in the

7
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:20,970
body. So these are
ectoderm, mesoderm, and

8
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,650
endoderm, same as other
parts of the body.

9
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,230
And in the ectoderm, in

10
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:27,550
addition to
the epidermis,

11
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:31,910
the ectoderm leads
to the creation of

12
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:34,330
the brain and the
cranial nerves. And

13
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,290
these are because
it is derived from

14
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:40,190
this neural tube, which
is going to become

15
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,150
both the brain and
the spinal cord.

16
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:45,790
You also have placodes
that are derived from

17
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:48,470
ectoderm, as we talked
about in the previous

18
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:50,810
part of the lecture.
And these are

19
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:53,150
associated with some of
the special senses in

20
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:55,250
the head and neck,
including the eye lens,

21
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,530
vestidial and
cochlea in the

22
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:59,070
inner ear and
nasal cavity.

23
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:02,090
And ectoderm is
also responsible

24
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:04,430
for generating
parotid gland.

25
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:10,090
Moving on to the
mesoderm, as expected,

26
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:12,610
these form the bones and
cartilaginous tissues,

27
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:15,130
arteries, and muscles.
And in the head,

28
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:17,550
a lot of these are
coming from pharyngeal

29
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:19,770
structures. Remember
the pharyngeal arches.

30
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,370
And the funny thing
about in the head is

31
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:25,910
that these mesodermal
tissues will interact

32
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:28,750
with what's called
neocrest cells, which

33
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:29,870
we'll be talking
about in the next

34
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:33,030
section. But neocrest
cells are ectodermally

35
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:37,170
derived, a very special
set of cells that

36
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,970
can kind of go from
ectoderm into cell

37
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,690
populations that kind
of act like mesoderm.

38
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:48,650
And then you also have
the skull, which is

39
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:53,350
part of the bone and
cartilaginous tissues

40
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,350
in the head. So
that's derived from

41
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:58,450
mesoderm as well. And
then endoderm, you have

42
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:00,410
the glandular tissues,
except for the

43
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:03,430
parotid gland, and then
the mucosae around the

44
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:06,590
oral and the nasal
cavities and beyond.

45
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:12,910
so i promise that
i'll be talking about

46
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:16,150
neurocrest cells so
neurocrest cells are

47
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,170
populations of cells
that originate in

48
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:20,710
the neural fold so
recall in earlier

49
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,290
embryonic lectures
that you have an

50
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:25,910
ectodermal layer in very
early embryonic stage

51
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:32,390
and the ectodermal
layer is going to

52
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:38,690
invaginate and then
is going to split off

53
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:41,260
and that split off part
is going to form a tube

54
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,270
and called neurotube
and this is what's

55
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,410
going to become the
brain and the spinal cord

56
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:47,990
and what you're
also left with

57
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:50,010
is this continuous
ectodermal

58
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:51,410
layer which is
going to later

59
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,410
produce the epidermis
but then during this

60
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:59,700
invagination process
there's a region

61
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,430
that's folded. And
this is called a neural

62
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:04,790
fold. And from there
emerges these very

63
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:07,650
special populations
of multi-potent cells

64
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:12,590
called neurocrest
cells. And neurocrest

65
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:16,090
cells are, again,
ectodermally derived,

66
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:19,950
but forms secondary
mesenchyme. So these

67
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,950
are mesoderm-like
structures. They act

68
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:26,290
like although they
came out of ectoderm.

69
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:29,890
And these neurocrest
cells migrate all

70
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:33,290
over the body to
turn into a wonderful

71
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:35,310
array of different
tissues. So these

72
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:38,230
include cartilage
and bone, teeth,

73
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:41,730
skin, melanocytes,
smooth muscles,

74
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:44,810
glands, adipose
tissue, neurons, glia,

75
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,130
adrenal medulla,

76
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:49,870
et cetera. And it's
responsible for most

77
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,830
of the connective and
the skeletal tissue

78
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:54,510
of the head, nerves,
and pigment cells.

79
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,110
And here are the
derivatives of the

80
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,010
neurocrest cells in
the head and neck

81
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:02,330
in all its glory.
So in terms of

82
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:05,130
cartilage and bone,
it forms most of

83
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:07,150
the bones and
cartilage in the head.

84
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:09,590
So these include
the facial bones,

85
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:12,550
which are listed
here, as well

86
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,290
as some in the
cranial base,

87
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:16,090
including parts of
the sphenoid bone.

88
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:18,570
And it also forms
all three of

89
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:19,810
the middle your
ossicles, the

90
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,570
malleus, incus,
and stapes,

91
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:24,030
hyoid, and the
laryngeal cartilage.

92
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,950
So these are all
cartilage and bony

93
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,410
structures that
are derived from

94
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:30,290
pharyngeal arches
from part one of this

95
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:32,770
lecture on head and
neck embryology.

96
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:38,170
In the same way, for
the nervous system

97
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:40,750
derivatives, it includes
sensory ganglia of

98
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,930
cranial nerve 5, 7,
9, and 10, which are

99
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:46,270
branchiomeric nerves. So
these are cranial nerves

100
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,730
that are associated
with pharyngeal arches.

101
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,630
And it also includes

102
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,930
their peripheral nerves.

103
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:58,090
And for the muscles,
so the neocrest cells

104
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:01,810
do not directly become
muscles, but they

105
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:04,070
interact with the
mesoderms in the

106
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:07,050
pharyngeal arches to
form the muscles of the

107
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:10,510
head and neck, including
the jaw muscles.

108
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,610
And then there
are other key

109
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:15,210
structures that
come from neocrest

110
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:16,890
cells. So these
include teeth,

111
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:18,970
particularly the dentine

112
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,870
component of it,
but not enamel.

113
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:24,810
It also forms dermis
and hyperdermis of the

114
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:28,050
face and the neck,
creates the choroid and

115
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:30,810
sclera of the eye,
and melanocytes in the

116
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:33,350
iris, as well as the
rest of the body. So if

117
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,330
you think that someone's
eyes and their eye

118
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:37,910
color is beautiful, you
can thank neurocrest

119
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:41,430
cells. And it's also
responsible for developing

120
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:44,630
meninges and connective
tissues of lacrimal

121
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:47,010
salivary and thymus
clads not the glandular

122
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:48,670
tissues themselves
but the connective

123
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:52,490
tissues surrounding
them and now what's

124
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:56,150
interesting is so neurocrest
cells have all these

125
00:05:56,150 --> 00:06:00,770
different kinds of
derivatives so there have

126
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:03,570
been a lot of research
on why we have so

127
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:06,430
many dog breeds and one
of the secrets could

128
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:09,030
be related to neurocrest
cells and that's

129
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:11,350
been demonstrated for
some of the attributes.

130
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:13,190
So for example, if you
look across different

131
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:16,970
dog breeds, you definitely
see quite different

132
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:19,110
and varying skull
shapes. For example,

133
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:21,430
looking at husky skill
and chihuahua skull.

134
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:24,050
And then obviously
dog breeds are

135
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,210
known for the
differences in fur color.

136
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:30,350
And what is the cause
or what are responsible

137
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:32,170
for some of these
traits? Well, it all

138
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:34,350
goes back to neurocrest
cells. So there

139
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:37,350
must've been
artificial selection on

140
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,630
neurocrest cells that
produced all these

141
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:42,990
coordinated changes very
quickly historically.

142
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,710
Now, we're going
to end it talking

143
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,950
about clinical
correlates related to

144
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,750
neurocrest cells.
And so one of them

145
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,470
is called Treacher
-Collins syndrome,

146
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:58,170
and it's caused by
genetic disorder that

147
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:01,070
involves faulty
migration of neurocrest

148
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:03,390
cells in the head
in the pharyngeal

149
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:07,310
arches one and two
and occurs about one

150
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:10,450
in 50,000 births.
And so the symptoms

151
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:13,130
or the syndrome
includes hearing loss,

152
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,670
downturned eyes,

153
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:17,190
underdevelopment
of the midface,

154
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:21,030
micronathia or a small
lower jaw and cleft

155
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:23,570
palate. So these
are all coordinated

156
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:28,070
traits that neurocrest
cell controls, especially

157
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:30,730
the development of
the facial bones.

158
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:34,510
So Treacher-Collin
syndrome is the result

159
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:37,690
of faulty migration
of neurocrest cells.

160
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:44,990
So let's end it with
an example question.

161
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:47,250
So a six-year-old
girl exhibits a

162
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,090
swelling in the anterior
part of her neck,

163
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:51,390
just inferior to the
thyroid bone. Which

164
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,310
of the following may
explain a swelling?

165
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:55,930
So in this question,
think about

166
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:59,090
the location of
the opening. Is

167
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:00,650
it on the midline
of the neck or

168
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:03,110
the lateral aspect
of the neck? So

169
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:14,650
the answer is C, which

170
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:16,970
is associated with the

171
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:21,730
thyroglossal duct cyst.
So if the swelling

172
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:23,630
or opening was
associated with the

173
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,590
lateral part of the
neck, then it would

174
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:28,450
have been the intact
cervical sinus.

175
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,530
And the obliteration
of the cervical

176
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:34,340
sinus, which is answer
B, which this is just

177
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,310
part of normal
development. So this

178
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:39,530
would not lead to any
particular swelling.

179
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:42,290
And then obliteration
of thytoglossal

180
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:44,790
ducts, similarly is
what happens under

181
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,270
typical development.
And then incomplete

182
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,670
closure of
secondary palate is

183
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:51,250
something that would
cause cleft palate.

184
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:55,450
So a totally different
kind of condition.

185
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,790
So together with the
previous lecture on

186
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,610
introduction to the
head and neck, I hope

187
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:04,690
I've convinced you
that the head and

188
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:07,310
the neck that supports
it is a truly special

189
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,990
and wonderfully
complex region. I know

190
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:14,390
it's a difficult
and very complicated

191
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:16,830
area of the body,
but I also hope that

192
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:19,570
you enjoy and appreciate
this complexity.

193
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:23,170
So just to finish
up this lecture,

194
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:25,730
These are the
topics that I

195
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:27,750
recommend you
focusing on in

196
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,370
your preparation
for the exams.

197
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,310
So first, make
sure you know the

198
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:33,790
derivatives of the
pharyngeal arches, pouches,

199
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,230
clefts, and
membranes. So complete

200
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:37,510
that table and study
off of that table.

201
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:40,250
Development of the
face, skull, palate,

202
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,370
tongue, thyroid
gland, placos,

203
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:44,350
and the pituitary
gland. Make sure you

204
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:48,550
understand the
process involved in

205
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:49,950
the development of
these structures.

206
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,890
And then the germ layer
and the neurocrestal

207
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:54,730
origins of the head
and neck structures.

208
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,630
And then, of
course, the clinical

209
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,570
implications
that arise from

210
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:00,630
abnormalities in head
and neck development

211
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:02,030
that I covered
in the lectures.

212
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,990
This is the end
of the FOM lecture

213
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:08,070
on the head and
neck embryology.

214
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:10,130
And I'd be grateful
if you can provide

215
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:11,930
