00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:04,690
Hello students. Welcome
to Pharmacokinetics.

2
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:06,910
We will be
talking about the

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:10,310
properties of
absorption, distribution,

4
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:13,530
metabolism, and
excretion. In this first

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,110
part, it will just
be absorption and

6
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:18,850
distribution. Dr.
Goldstein speaking.

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,070
Please contact
me if you'd

8
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:25,830
like a pharmacology chat.

9
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:32,570
Recall the pharmacokinetics
pharmacodynamics

10
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:35,230
relationship. The drug
gets into the body,

11
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:38,870
gets distributed, goes
to the pharmacologic

12
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:43,210
site of action, produces
its effect, whether

13
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,310
it's a therapeutic
effect or an adverse

14
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:48,350
effect. There is some
sort of a clinical

15
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:53,430
response And that could
be effectiveness, the

16
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:57,370
goal, or toxicity,
something to be minimized.

17
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:02,850
The processes of
pharmacokinetics are

18
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:08,570
absorption, indicated here
by input, distribution,

19
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,950
and elimination. So
elimination would be

20
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:15,990
biotransformation, in
other words, metabolism

21
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:22,810
to an inactive
metabolite or excreted.

22
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:28,740
The key factor?

23
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:34,490
Concentration. The
concentration in the

24
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:37,410
plasma will determine
the concentration at

25
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:41,330
the site of action and
that will determine

26
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:44,830
the magnitude of the
pharmacologic effect.

27
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:50,070
So,

28
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:53,990
how important really
is pharmacokinetics?

29
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:57,670
It is the pharmacokinetic
properties of

30
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:02,310
drugs that influence
efficacy and safety.

31
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:07,030
The goal of therapy
is to increase the

32
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:09,530
probability of therapeutic
success, and this

33
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:12,270
is going to depend
on the dose and

34
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:15,250
certain other factors,
and to reduce the

35
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,630
occurrence of adverse
effects in the body.

36
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:21,550
Sometimes we can't
stop them, but we can

37
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:25,570
at least minimize them
and mitigate them.

38
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:31,030
Here are the
learning objectives,

39
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,590
and it's all related to

40
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,770
mechanisms,
mechanisms, mechanisms.

41
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:39,210
Please read these over.

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,670
You don't need me
to read them to you.

43
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:46,790
Preparation materials.

44
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,890
The only thing
that I require

45
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:50,550
is the practice
questions.

46
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:56,230
These are case vignettes
and thought problems.

47
00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:00,630
I will help you
to apply the basic

48
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:05,690
concepts of pharmacology
through practice

49
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:08,870
questions. And when you
receive the answers,

50
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,590
then you will
see the thought

51
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,530
processes and
this will help you

52
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:17,170
to really learn
pharmacology.

53
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:21,170
Here are some
resources if you

54
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:23,070
choose to use them.
I provided the

55
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,710
links. They are
all available.

56
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,170
These textbook
resources are all

57
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:34,650
available in our
medical library.

58
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:41,770
I've provided
some hints to help

59
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:45,250
you to actually
master a topic

60
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:49,470
to avoid the
illusion of knowing.

61
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:54,330
You may find them
helpful as you go

62
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:57,910
through this difficult
material. The material

63
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:00,050
itself isn't
difficult, it's just

64
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:02,230
that you get so much
of it all at once.

65
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:06,930
And here are some tips.

66
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:11,590
I really would like
you to try them out.

67
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,930
Rephrase the main
ideas in your own

68
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:19,660
words. It's about
your own words.

69
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:24,210
You can make a
question out of them.

70
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,770
That helps you
think about it.

71
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:30,170
Relate the ideas
to what you

72
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:32,950
already know and
that will help

73
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:36,430
make it stick
in your brain.

74
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,230
And here are
some techniques.

75
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:47,890
The definitions
are here to help

76
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:50,470
you with the language
of pharmacology,

77
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:52,610
the language of medicine.

78
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:56,730
More terms.

79
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:01,710
I've provided this
overview of really

80
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:04,210
of what you need to
know and understand.

81
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:08,530
So you can focus
on these concepts

82
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:12,150
and that will answer
your question of

83
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,310
what do I need to
know for the test.

84
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:18,050
And I have several slides

85
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:20,410
of concepts for you.

86
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,790
So let us begin.

87
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:35,770
The basic idea is
a drug is given at

88
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:39,330
some particular dose.
And how do we know

89
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:41,830
what dose to give?
We look it up in the

90
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:44,270
drug monograph and
that will guide us.

91
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:49,090
But we still have to
remember about our

92
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:52,190
individual patient and
there may need to be

93
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:54,890
adjustments of the doses
that are recommended.

94
00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:02,850
In the case of oral
drugs especially, they

95
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:05,970
have to be liberated
out of their tablet or

96
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:08,830
capsule or whatever
form they're going in.

97
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:17,370
And then the drug
itself must be absorbed.

98
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:21,250
If we're giving
it by intravenous

99
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,570
administration, it's just

100
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:24,150
going straight
into the vein.

101
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:29,090
An oral drug needs to

102
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:30,590
pass through the liver

103
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:35,930
and then it will
go to the central

104
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:39,470
compartment, and that
is the bloodstream

105
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:42,130
and the highly
perfused organs.

106
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:45,390
If it is an IV
drug, it just goes

107
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,570
straight into the
central compartment.

108
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:53,850
Once there, the free
drug will then move

109
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:59,050
to the site of
action, move to be

110
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:02,770
stuck on tissue
macromolecules, they call

111
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:05,910
that tissue
reservoirs, can move to

112
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:09,430
areas that are not the
therapeutic target,

113
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,950
but rather produce
adverse effects.

114
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:15,430
Notice these
two-way arrows.

115
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:19,810
The drug will move in and

116
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:23,130
out, in and
out, in and out.

117
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:31,110
the drug can be bound
to plasma proteins

118
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:34,770
and if it's bound to
plasma proteins it will

119
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:39,050
be riding around on
the protein bus in

120
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:43,010
the bloodstream and it
will not move to the

121
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:45,550
site of action until
it gets off the bus.

122
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:51,950
It can bind to the same
idea of these inert

123
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,690
molecules in the tissues,
the same concept.

124
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:04,350
Even an IV drug or
anything that bypasses

125
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:07,310
the liver first and
goes to the central

126
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:10,090
compartment will
certainly pass through the

127
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:14,580
liver where it will
undergo metabolism.

128
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:19,110
And then the
metabolites, and that can

129
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:21,610
include a metabolite
that's actually

130
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:26,090
active, toxic or
inactive, will move into

131
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:28,370
the central compartment
again from the

132
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:30,710
liver where it will
go to be excreted,

133
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:34,610
but it may also be
excreted straight

134
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:41,130
out of the liver to
the biliary system.

135
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:46,130
So that's another
route of excretion.

136
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:50,550
So this very simple
figure really

137
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:54,630
sums up absorption,
distribution,

138
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:57,990
metabolism, and
excretion, and

139
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:00,830
how all are related
to each other.

140
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:08,810
A drug must withstand
digestive fluids

141
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:11,010
and enzymes. We're
talking about drugs

142
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:13,870
that are swallowed
into the GI tract and

143
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:16,770
the digestive fluids
and enzymes are in

144
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:21,910
the stomach. The drug
must move into the

145
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:24,990
intestine where it
will be absorbed and

146
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:27,910
once it's absorbed
it has and once it's

147
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,970
the intestine it has
to be able to cross

148
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:33,730
the physiologic
barriers to be absorbed

149
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:37,630
and to be distributed

150
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,150
to the site of action.

151
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:44,690
The drug must be
able to exit the

152
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:46,690
site of action
after providing

153
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:49,210
the specific
therapeutic effect

154
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:54,010
and it must be
eliminated either by

155
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,170
metabolism to inactive
metabolites which is

156
00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:02,210
certainly the most
common, or it actually

157
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:06,890
may be metabolized to
an active metabolite

158
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:10,370
or a toxic metabolite.
In any case,

159
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:15,430
if it's metabolized to
an active metabolite,

160
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:19,030
that will terminate
the drug effect,

161
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:23,270
and that is equivalent
to elimination

162
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:27,910
via metabolism.

163
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:35,690
The drug needs to
be excreted and this

164
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:40,610
is by far most frequently
via the kidney.

165
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:41,830
By far.

166
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:45,890
In the kidney,

167
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:49,850
through the kidney,
inactive metabolites

168
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:53,910
or unchanged drug
may pass through

169
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:57,890
or active metabolites
may pass through

170
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:03,470
and then be excreted
via the urine.

171
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,670
Let's begin with
absorption. The movement

172
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:12,010
of substances
across physiologic

173
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:15,430
barriers into the
central circulation and

174
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,630
of course we're talking
about the drugs.

175
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,850
There are a
number of ways to

176
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:24,330
pass through
physiologic barriers.

177
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:29,310
Passive diffusion
through the membrane,

178
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:35,450
the lipophilic
membrane, is the most

179
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:40,650
frequent method
of diffusion, of

180
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:43,650
passage through the
physiologic barriers.

181
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:47,190
Other mechanisms that
many drugs may be

182
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:50,910
using are through
transporters. So we see all

183
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,270
these various types
of transporters listed

184
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:56,030
here. I won't go into
it now because I'll

185
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:58,850
be talking about that
a little bit later.

186
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:02,370
Another way is for
molecules that are

187
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:07,530
dissolved in the plasma,
small molecules, can

188
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:11,910
pass between cells,
paracellular transport,

189
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:14,430
by solvent drag.

190
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:20,550
So first let's
talk about passive

191
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:23,010
diffusion of the
lipid-soluble

192
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:26,790
drugs across
cell membranes.

193
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:32,670
The key driver is
the concentration

194
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:35,790
gradient. The
drug will pass

195
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:39,390
down an area of
high concentration

196
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,290
to an area of low
concentration.

197
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:50,570
When the number of
molecules on one side

198
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,910
equals the number
of molecules on the

199
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:58,850
other side, It will be
in a dynamic equilibrium,

200
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:09,250
and there will be
no net movement.

201
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:18,830
The rate, in
pharmacokinetics, we're

202
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:22,770
talking about rate,
and we will also talk

203
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:26,230
about the extent,
how much, how fast

204
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:29,410
and how much the
drug molecules move.

205
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:33,630
So the rate and
extent of the flow of

206
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:35,710
the drug molecules
are influenced by

207
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,570
the magnitude of
the concentration

208
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:40,570
gradient across the
membrane. The greater

209
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,970
the gradient, the
faster the rate.

210
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:47,230
The lipid water
partition coefficient

211
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:50,390
of the drug will
determine its ability

212
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:54,090
to get through
this lipid layer.

213
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:59,470
The membrane surface
area of the drug,

214
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:06,270
so how much of the
membrane is available

215
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:10,070
for passage? Is
it a large amount

216
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:13,510
or is it just
maybe, let's use the

217
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:16,330
other side, just
maybe a small amount?

218
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:20,410
the permeability of the

219
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:23,470
membrane and
the thickness.

220
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:26,670
If it's a thick
membrane, let's make a

221
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:30,710
thick membrane, versus
a thin membrane, it

222
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:32,770
will take longer to
pass through the thick

223
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:36,190
membrane than thin
membrane. So all kinds

224
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:39,610
of different features
of the membrane

225
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:42,810
determine the rate and
extent of the flow.

226
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:50,130
This is the basic
concept that describes

227
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:53,930
the movement of drug
across the membrane,

228
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:56,910
across the physiologic
barrier. You do not

229
00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:01,310
need to memorize
this equation, this

230
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:06,090
relationship, but you
should recognize, This is

231
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:09,010
the takeaway, that
diffusion across the lipid

232
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:12,390
bilayer of cell
membranes depends on the

233
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:15,970
drug's lipid water
partition coefficient.

234
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:19,170
And that is going
to determine how

235
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:21,730
readily the drug
enters the lipid

236
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:24,510
membrane from the
aqueous medium.

237
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:29,390
It's related to
the concentration

238
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:31,910
gradient, the area, the

239
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,970
permeability, and
the thickness.

240
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:39,530
of the drug and
the membrane.

241
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:45,410
Weak acids and weak
bases, the Henderson

242
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:48,870
-Hasselbalch equation
and ion trapping.

243
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:54,570
For weak acids and
weak bases, the pKa

244
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:57,210
of the drug and the
pH of the medium

245
00:15:57,210 --> 00:16:00,190
determine the ratio
of molecules in

246
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:03,650
the charged or
ionized form compared

247
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:07,670
to the uncharged and
non-ionized form.

248
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:10,310
Here is the key.

249
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:18,630
The uncharged, non
-ionized form is the more

250
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:24,330
lipid-soluble form of
the drug. So a weak

251
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:27,330
acid and weak bases
dissociate in fluid.

252
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:30,570
They dissociate to
an uncharged form and

253
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:33,970
a charged form. It
is the uncharged form

254
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:37,150
that will pass
through the membranes.

255
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:42,130
Now, a greater
fraction of the weak

256
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:45,870
acid will be in the
lipid-soluble form

257
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:53,690
in the more acidic
medium, where the

258
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:58,250
pH is lower than
the pKa of the drug.

259
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:02,070
A greater fraction
of the weak base

260
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:05,450
will be in the lipid
-soluble B form, you

261
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:07,270
notice there's no
proton on there,

262
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:11,610
in a more alkaline
medium where the pH

263
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:16,170
is greater than the
pKa of the drug.

264
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,930
I'm sure you're familiar
with the Henderson

265
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:22,050
-Hasselbalch equation.
What we're looking at

266
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:28,110
in pharmacology is the
ratio of the unprotonated

267
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:31,390
form to the protonated
form. How much

268
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:35,530
of the drug, of a weak
acid or weak base,

269
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:40,810
is going to pass through
the lipid membrane?

270
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:44,030
We know the pH.

271
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:48,330
pH is very in the
body. We think about

272
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:51,590
plasma as 7.4, plasma
and interstitial

273
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:54,330
fluids as 7.4, so
we know the pH,

274
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:57,210
and we know the
pKa of the drug, so

275
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:01,450
that leaves the ratio
to be determined.

276
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,390
To repeat,

277
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:08,150
the lower the pH
relative to the

278
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:11,250
pKa, the greater
will be the fraction

279
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:14,390
of drug in the
protonated form.

280
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:21,350
Weak acids are
not ionized when

281
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,550
they're protonated
and that's indicated

282
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:26,470
by A for acid
and H for proton.

283
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:32,270
Weak bases are
ionized when they are

284
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:36,730
protonated. B for
base and H for proton.

285
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,910
Key concept.

286
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:44,610
Here it is illustrated.

287
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:47,750
We have our
lipid bilayer.

288
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:52,130
We have our different
body compartments.

289
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:57,350
The non-ionized
form of the, sorry,

290
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:59,390
the ionized form of
the acid indicated

291
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:03,230
located by A- will
not pass through.

292
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:07,270
The HA form will
pass through.

293
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:09,230
Here it is on
the other side,

294
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:12,270
dissociating
dependent on the

295
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:15,610
pKa and the pH
of the fluid in

296
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:17,590
the body
compartment it's in.

297
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,730
Weak base,

298
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:24,050
the protonated form
will not pass through.

299
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:27,450
The non-protonated
B form will

300
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:29,970
pass through and
same concept,

301
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,550
just the weak
base this time.

302
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:38,020
This figure here
at the top shows

303
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:42,010
the pKa right here
in the middle.

304
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:48,090
When the pH equals
the pKa then And the

305
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:53,470
both forms, the
ionized and non-ionized

306
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:56,240
forms, are in equal
concentration.

307
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:04,770
Let's say the pKa
of the weak acid is

308
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:07,590
right here. It doesn't
have to be right

309
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:11,530
here. Let's say it's
right here. Then we

310
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:16,050
have an increasing
amount of the ionized

311
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:19,770
form as we move up.
An increasing amount

312
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:23,090
of the non-ionized
form as we move down.

313
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:29,230
But very few areas
in the body have a pH

314
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:32,450
so low. The one
exception is the stomach.

315
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:35,950
Let's say we have a weak

316
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:37,770
base of, let's say here.

317
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:43,270
then the majority
of it will be in the

318
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:49,090
ionized form BH
plus but as the pH

319
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:51,710
increases the majority
will be in the B

320
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:57,930
non-ionized form but
there the pH is in

321
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:00,870
this area are
incompatible with life.

322
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:06,830
To repeat non-ionized
molecules diffuse

323
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:09,230
used readily across
the membrane.

324
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:16,880
So what do we do
with this information

325
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,530
in terms of the
clinical utilization

326
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:23,250
of it? It's all
very interesting.

327
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:28,430
It's called ion
trapping. Trapping

328
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:32,590
of the ionized
form in a fluid

329
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:35,590
for the purpose, usually,

330
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:38,350
of increasing the rate of

331
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:41,510
excretion of a
toxic compound.

332
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:48,050
We can also talk
about it in terms of

333
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:51,110
how much drug is
going to be excreted

334
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:55,930
in a particular pH
of urine versus how

335
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:58,110
much will stay
in. That can be

336
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:00,590
therapeutically important,
but not commonly.

337
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:05,130
Starting on the
left-hand side.

338
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:09,210
Blood pH, 7.4.

339
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:18,210
A drug in concentration
of one micromolar

340
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:24,230
in the non-protonated
form. This is a weak

341
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:26,390
base we're talking
about in this example.

342
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:33,490
and the pH with this
example which I took

343
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:39,070
from the basic and clinical
pharmacology review

344
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:44,450
book it is a weight
base with a pK of 7.0

345
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:50,730
the tendency
is to be in the

346
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:53,970
non-ionized non
-protonated form

347
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:59,790
and we still of course
get a certain amount

348
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:03,170
in the protonated form
so between the two

349
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:08,050
we have one micromole
and the non-protonated

350
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:12,210
0.4 micromole and the
protonated and here's

351
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:17,270
the total it is one
drug after all the non

352
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:20,310
-protonated form readily
crosses the membrane

353
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:23,850
you see here it can
cross both directions.

354
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:27,830
The pH of the urine,
however, is 6.0 in

355
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:30,410
this example, which
is pretty common.

356
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,070
Urine tends to be acidic.

357
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:36,450
And we see this
thicker arrow

358
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:42,430
pointing towards
the protonated form.

359
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:49,690
Lower pH, more of
the molecule of this

360
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:52,570
weak base will be in
the protonated form.

361
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:55,510
So, we still have
1 micromole of

362
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:57,990
the non-protonated,
but we have 11

363
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:02,370
micromoles of the
protonated form.

364
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:05,910
Therefore, we
have a greater

365
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:07,930
amount that's
not passing back

366
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:13,650
through, indicated
by this arrow.

367
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:16,830
And it will
pass out through

368
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,050
the urine and
be excreted.

369
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:26,090
It's a basic idea
of ion trapping.

370
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:29,830
This is actually
a strategy used

371
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:34,530
most frequently for
salicylate toxicity.

372
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:36,890
And salicylate
is a weak acid.

373
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:40,750
So the whole
idea then would

374
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:49,170
be to increase
urine pH to 7 or

375
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:51,770
8, as high as
we can get it,

376
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:54,810
so that we can trap
the salicylate in the

377
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:57,350
urine and excrete it
at a greater rate.

378
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:02,250
Let's talk about
transporters now.

379
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,710
That's another way for
drugs to pass through

380
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:07,950
physiologic barriers.
Not all drugs have

381
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:11,450
the lipid solubility
to be able to actually

382
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:14,000
pass through the
bilayer. So there are

383
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,270
transporters. And these
transporters, of course,

384
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:20,630
are present because our
natural body processes

385
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:23,810
require them, but the
drugs use them also.

386
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:24,990
Now,

387
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:27,870
membrane transporters
are selective,

388
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:31,310
so a drug must
actually need to be a

389
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:35,670
substrate of the
transporter in order

390
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:38,630
for it to pass through
the transporter.

391
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,250
and it is selective
for a specific

392
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:46,050
conformational
structure of the

393
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:48,210
drug. That's
basically what we're

394
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:51,170
talking about,
being a substrate.

395
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:55,390
They are saturable
because they are

396
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:58,530
doors. They are
doors across the

397
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:02,750
membrane and if
they're busy, then

398
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:04,790
other drugs can't
pass through them.

399
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:12,190
their expression can be
increased or decreased

400
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:16,610
just like metabolic
enzymes they are

401
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:20,710
subject to competitive
inhibition as i said before

402
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:24,070
if they are busy
another substrate is not

403
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:26,150
going to be able to
pass through it because

404
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:30,910
it's busy it's saturated
all of them saturated

405
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:33,630
It's not just one
transporter, there are

406
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:36,550
probably hundreds of
thousands, at least.

407
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:40,730
It is also subject
to non-competitive

408
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:43,650
inhibition. In other
words, a drug that

409
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:47,210
binds to an allosteric
site can change

410
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:49,490
the conformation of
the transporter such

411
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:52,170
that the substrate
is unable to bind.

412
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:55,930
Excuse me, I pushed
the wrong button.

413
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:59,130
Genetic variance.

414
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:03,110
Well we all have our
certain appearances

415
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:07,670
based on our genes
and the transporters

416
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:11,530
can be subject
to mutations that

417
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:14,670
increase or decrease
their effects.

418
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:20,250
There is a potential
for adverse effects

419
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:25,370
and drug interactions
based on the fact

420
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:29,050
that they can be
induced, down-regulated,

421
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:31,710
competitive inhibition,
non-competitive

422
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:34,810
inhibition, and
genetic variants.

423
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:42,130
This figure
here shows that

424
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:44,950
transporters really
are everywhere.

425
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:49,430
There are two major
families, the SLC

426
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:53,250
or solute carrier
family. These are

427
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:55,670
the carrier proteins,
the channels,

428
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:58,310
secondary active
transporters.

429
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:03,260
The carrier proteins
and channels just allow

430
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:07,710
passive diffusion,
facilitative diffusion

431
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:11,090
and passive diffusion,
down the concentration

432
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:15,070
gradient without the
requirement of energy.

433
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:18,690
The drug molecule just
moves through until

434
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:22,450
the concentrations on
both sides are equal.

435
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:26,190
And then it
would be no net

436
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:29,890
movement, a dynamic
equilibrium.

437
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:33,910
And I'm writing this

438
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:35,510
again so you
don't forget.

439
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:40,730
Secondary active
transporters are the type

440
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:46,070
where two or more
substances will use that

441
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:49,130
same transporter. One
substance, frequently

442
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:51,990
sodium, moves down its
concentration gradient,

443
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:54,250
in this case
electrochemical gradient,

444
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:56,910
that supplies the
energy for the

445
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:58,730
movement of
another substance.

446
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:04,950
And the ABC
superfamily, ATP.

447
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:07,950
All you have to really
remember is AATP.

448
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:12,490
AATP. ATP
requires energy.

449
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:14,050
I mean, it
supplies energy.

450
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:17,910
for primary
active transport

451
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:20,850
against the
concentration gradient.

452
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:29,050
The ATPase is the
enzyme that catalyzes

453
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:34,210
ATP hydrolysis supplying
the energy. The

454
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:44,910
ABC superfamily
of primary active

455
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:51,010
transporters provide active
efflux of xenobiotics,

456
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:53,010
products that we
put into our body

457
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:56,690
that are not natural
to the body and get

458
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:59,830
pushed back against
the concentration

459
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:04,460
gradient. A typical
example would be the

460
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:07,210
intestine, where the
drug goes into the

461
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:10,190
epithelial cells
and gets pushed back

462
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:13,450
into the lumen. It
should go like this.

463
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:17,090
And the liver.

464
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:25,170
There are active
transporters for biliary

465
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:29,090
excretion to push them
out of the hepatocytes

466
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:32,350
into the biliary
system. for excretion.

467
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:35,290
Kidney, same thing. Blood

468
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:39,170
-brain barrier,
and on and on.

469
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:44,630
Point out this
little figure

470
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:46,850
here. This is,
I believe, to

471
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:48,790
represent the
placental barrier,

472
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:51,430
but I could be
wrong about that.

473
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:53,210
Maybe you can tell.

474
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:01,600
Here we have figures
of the various types of

475
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:06,080
transporters. We have
carrier protein and

476
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:12,640
facilitated transport
channel, all these

477
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:17,660
various solute carrier
types of transporters for

478
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:20,420
passive transport,
facilitated transport.

479
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:25,820
And our active
transporters, this is called

480
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:30,180
a sodium potassium
ATPase, and that is

481
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:34,920
the motor that powers
active transport.

482
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,260
Here's our ATP,

483
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,420
goes to ADP,
releases that

484
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:41,820
phosphate with energy.

485
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:47,320
This is an example
of ion channels,

486
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:51,640
sodium ATPase
again, sodium

487
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:54,280
potassium ATPase
supplying the power,

488
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:59,160
sodium then goes down
the concentration

489
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,860
gradient and that
supplies the energy

490
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,980
for the movement,
in this case of

491
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:10,300
bicarbonate, and in
this case of an active,

492
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:13,180
sorry, this is an
antipower, it goes the

493
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,500
different direction,
the opposite

494
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,950
direction. And this is
some other molecule.

495
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,780
Passive transport,
secondary active

496
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:26,580
transport, and primary
active transport.

497
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:33,460
The p-glycoprotein
is one of

498
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:36,760
the most well
-studied ATPases.

499
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:43,640
It is, this is a
picture of it. You don't

500
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,680
have to memorize
what it looks like.

501
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,980
You don't have to
recreate that. What you

502
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:51,260
do need to know is
that P-glycoprotein

503
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:56,620
is an ATP-dependent
pump, active efflux

504
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:59,340
of drugs from the
cell. We'll be talking

505
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:02,260
about this over and
over and over and

506
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:04,880
over because it
is essential for

507
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,700
understanding certain
drug-drug interactions.

508
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:13,400
P-glycoprotein is located
on the apical side

509
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,040
of plasma membranes
right next to lumens.

510
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:23,520
It is expressed in
intestine, liver,

511
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,700
kidney, brain capillaries,
placenta, other

512
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:28,860
tissues. It is
expressed on tumor

513
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:33,700
cells and confers
multi-drug resistance.

514
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:37,400
And there are certain
efflux transporters

515
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:43,640
on bacteria that pump
our antibiotics out.

516
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,570
A little bit of a review.

517
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:53,160
The practice
questions give more

518
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,580
interesting questions
for application

519
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,740
of the knowledge.
This is just a

520
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:00,020
check your knowledge
review, and I

521
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:02,400
recommend that you
pause the computer,

522
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:06,580
answer them in
your own words from

523
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,820
your own memory,
and then after you

524
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:11,400
try, look it
up, and then try

525
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,680
answering from your
own memory again.

526
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,980
So please pause
if you wish.

527
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:22,820
And coming back now,
what physicochemical

528
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:25,380
property determines the
ability of a drug to

529
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:28,420
passively diffuse
through lipid membranes?

530
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,920
By what mechanism
can a hydrophilic

531
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:34,380
drug cross
physiologic barriers?

532
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:37,540
For drugs that
are weak acids and

533
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,380
weak bases, why
is the pH of a

534
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:41,940
biologic fluid
clinically important?

535
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:45,030
And here are the answers.

536
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:48,040
The lipid water
coefficient of a

537
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,060
drug, which is the
ratio of the drug

538
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,240
in the lipid and
the aqueous phases,

539
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:55,640
determines how
readily the drug

540
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:58,740
molecule moves across
lipid membranes.

541
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:01,100
Lipid-soluble
drugs passively

542
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,620
diffuse through the lipid

543
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:04,680
membranes, which
are not saturable.

544
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,060
The rate of transfer, I'm

545
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,560
always talking
about rates,

546
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,700
across the membranes
from an area

547
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,540
of higher
concentration to lower

548
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:17,640
concentration is
directly proportional

549
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:21,600
to the lipid
water coefficient.

550
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,360
A hydrophilic drug
can cross physiologic

551
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,280
barriers via
transport proteins.

552
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,000
Passive diffusion or
facilitated transport

553
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,960
down the concentration
gradient.

554
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,860
Or energy using
active transport.

555
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:40,360
That would be
secondary and primary.

556
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:44,760
Transporters are
saturable. When all the

557
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:49,680
transporters are occupied,
then nothing else

558
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,470
can get through until
they are unoccupied.

559
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:56,660
They are at their
maximum rate of transfer.

560
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:00,720
Weak acids and weak
bases either gain or

561
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,300
lose electrical charge
-bearing protons, depending

562
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:07,920
on their pKa and the
pH of the medium.

563
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:11,520
only the uncharged
form of the drug will

564
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,080
passively diffuse across
the lipid bilayer while

565
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:18,580
the charged form does
not this is called

566
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:26,500
ion ion trapping
manipulation of urine ph may

567
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,940
be appropriate for
increasing the rate of

568
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:32,000
excretion by ion
trapping of certain drugs

569
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,060
such as toxic concentrations
of salicylates.

570
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,960
Okay, so how do we
introduce the drug

571
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,920
into the body? Looking
at this figure,

572
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:51,800
it's easy to see
that basically by any

573
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:57,340
method, any *******
and injection into

574
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,740
everywhere,

575
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,800
basically.

576
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:04,360
Skin, veins,

577
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,560
arteries,

578
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,440
spine,

579
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,040
ventricles.

580
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:13,640
Selection of the
root is determined by

581
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,560
the properties of the
drug and therapeutic

582
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:19,220
objectives. What
is the goal of

583
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:21,440
therapy? How quickly
does the drug need

584
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:26,900
to be on board in
therapeutic levels.

585
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:32,380
I'm not going to
go through every

586
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:34,600
single route of
administration.

587
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,540
I have a table at
the end of this

588
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:43,340
PowerPoint with the
benefits and disadvantages

589
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:46,200
of all of the
various routes of

590
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:49,320
administration. You
do need to know it.

591
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:58,560
need to know this
is medicine. This is

592
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,960
how you are going
to administer drugs

593
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,160
to your patient. So
this is straightforward,

594
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:08,680
and you can look
through that

595
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:11,820
on your own. You do
need to learn it.

596
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:17,340
This is a quick
overview. enteral roots

597
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:21,460
either so going through
the mouth basically

598
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:25,160
or an enteral tube
or at the other

599
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:29,500
end rectally going into
the gut now sublingual

600
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:32,700
and buckle go into
the mouth this

601
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,860
is tongue under the
tongue this is between

602
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:38,480
the gum and cheek
but they pass through

603
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,620
the mucous membranes
of the mouth into

604
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:45,020
the venous drainage
of the oral cavity.

605
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:49,660
The upper small
intestine, upper

606
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:52,280
small intestine, is
the major site of

607
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:55,160
oral drug absorption
because the

608
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,580
intestine is made for
absorption. That's

609
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:59,960
its job. It's an
absorptive organ.

610
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:03,320
The stomach is
not an absorptive

611
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:06,940
organ. It is a
digestive organ.

612
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:13,020
Parenteral, so drugs
that are injected.

613
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:15,340
I've indicated all the

614
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,900
various routes
of injection.

615
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:21,340
Topical, we think
of topical as

616
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:23,260
application for
local effect.

617
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:28,160
Skin comes to mind
readily, eyes, ears.

618
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,400
Lungs,

619
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,060
people who take
inhalers for

620
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:34,140
lung disease.
we're applying the

621
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,980
drug directly
to lung tissue.

622
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:39,360
Gut, if the drug
is not absorbed and

623
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,900
stays in the gut,
it can actually

624
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:44,060
be used topically
for gut problems.

625
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:48,880
And transdermal, this
is transmucosal here,

626
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:57,360
transdermal is
topical, however it's

627
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,040
intended to pass
through the skin

628
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,160
layers for systemic
circulation.

629
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:09,940
This little figure
shows where the

630
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:13,480
needle is injected
for various

631
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,340
parenteral roots
through the skin.

632
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,340
So that's all I'm
going to say about

633
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:24,800
absorption and
administration, or I

634
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,220
should say routes
of administration,

635
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:29,260
so please do learn
that on your own.

636
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,800
So distribution
is the process by

637
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,600
which a drug
reversibly leaves the

638
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,540
bloodstream
and enters the

639
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:38,660
interstitial and
intracellular fluids.

640
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:43,540
Moving through the
body, two targets.

641
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:48,160
First pass effect,
bioavailability, and

642
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,820
extent of distribution.
The first pass

643
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:57,380
effect is merely how
much of the drug that's

644
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:00,520
taken ****** will
pass through the gut

645
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:04,180
into the portal
circulation, pass through

646
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:09,660
the liver and be
metabolized within the

647
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:13,560
liver. So first pass
effect is basically

648
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:20,600
the inactivation by
drug metabolism and

649
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:24,640
a certain percent will
then be distributed

650
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:28,580
however much manages
to get through

651
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:32,520
that process to the
systemic circulation.

652
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:36,260
So the first pass
effect just to

653
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:39,540
reiterate so you won't
be confused, is about

654
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:44,060
the inactivation by
drug metabolizing.

655
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:47,300
Enzymes of oral
drugs, because they

656
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:50,580
pass through the
liver first before

657
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:52,760
going into the
systemic circulation.

658
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:57,200
Now bioavailability
is the amount

659
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,940
that actually
passes through and

660
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:02,220
gets to the systemic
circulation.

661
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:09,000
so it is the fraction
of the dose of the

662
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,560
active drug that
reaches the systemic

663
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,820
circulation so a drug
that is taken ******

664
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:17,780
and is completely
metabolized through by

665
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:20,660
the liver on the first
pass is not a useful

666
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:24,080
drug because very
little of it will

667
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:28,300
get to the systemic
circulation So, all

668
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:32,520
drugs that are oral
must have some degree

669
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:36,160
of bioavailability in
order to be useful.

670
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:43,000
the rate and extent of
distribution through

671
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,940
the body is determined
by for the i don't

672
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:49,080
know how many times
now 25th time or

673
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:51,660
something the physical
physical chemical

674
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:55,840
properties of the
drug and the patient's

675
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:59,540
physiologic factors is
the patient young and

676
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:02,860
healthy? Does the
patient have adequate

677
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:06,440
cardiac output, adequate
regional blood flow?

678
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:10,760
How is the capillary
permeability? That's

679
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:13,480
how drugs get into
interstitial spaces.

680
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,280
And what is the volume
of this patient,

681
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,460
the tissue volume?
How large are

682
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:23,540
they? How much muscle
mass do they have?

683
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:26,500
How much fat mass
do they have, etc.

684
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,580
Now redistribution,
that's certainly

685
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:33,880
an important concept
in distribution.

686
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,760
We'll talk about
redistribution.

687
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:39,820
This is so boards
relevant. So

688
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:46,660
what is it? What
we're talking

689
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:51,130
about is one dose
of a highly lipid

690
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:52,900
soluble drug. So
what kind of drug

691
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:55,040
is that? Let's
say an anesthetic.

692
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,560
That's when we
talk about it most

693
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,920
frequently. So we're
talking about one

694
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,800
dose of an anesthetic.
We might be

695
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,160
talking about an
anti-seizure drug.

696
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:10,580
So we see on this figure,

697
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:12,560
the peak is right here.

698
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:16,060
So if it's an oral
drug, it's going to

699
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:18,540
be a lag time. But
let's talk about an

700
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:22,180
IV drug. It's administered
IV, gets right

701
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:26,040
away into the
bloodstream, and it will

702
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:30,300
be carried
through the body

703
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:33,880
to the highly
perfused organs.

704
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:37,980
So VRG stands for
vessel-rich group.

705
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:41,700
And what is the
vessel-rich group that

706
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:43,880
we're concerned with
with an anesthetic?

707
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:48,400
The brain, CNS, brain,
and spinal cord.

708
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,300
All right, this
one dose of

709
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:54,440
drug travels to the brain

710
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,800
and because the
brain tissue has no

711
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:00,900
molecules in it at
that moment and the

712
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:03,800
concentration in blood
is high, the drug will

713
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,980
move down its
concentration gradient into

714
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:08,820
the CNS tissues and
produce its effects.

715
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:11,660
And as the drug
does that and

716
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:12,900
moves through
the body, the

717
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:16,180
concentration in
drug now decreases.

718
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:21,100
At the same time, the
vessel-rich group,

719
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:24,100
including the CNS, is
taking up the drug.

720
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:30,880
So the concentration
increases in the vessel

721
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,180
-rich group, decreases
in the bloodstream,

722
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:35,240
there's only a certain
amount that has to go

723
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:39,000
around to everywhere,
produces its effect.

724
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:42,580
And as the
bloodstream, as

725
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:45,180
the drug in
blood is reduced,

726
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,500
you see it's even
going into the

727
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:49,860
skeletal muscles
here, but much

728
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:53,060
more slowly because
they're less

729
00:45:54,510 --> 00:45:57,500
perfused than the
vessel-rich group.

730
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,760
Now the drug is
moving out of the CNS

731
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,240
tissues back into
the blood because the

732
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,660
concentration gradient
in the blood is lower.

733
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:08,000
Okay,

734
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,720
and drug moves to
the other tissues

735
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:14,000
based on the level
or perfusion. So the

736
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,800
point is, with
redistribution, the drug

737
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:21,260
produces its CNS
effect very rapidly.

738
00:46:22,410 --> 00:46:24,560
And with the one dose,

739
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:30,200
as the concentration
in plasma decreases,

740
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:34,060
the CNS effect decreases,

741
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:37,320
decreased CNS effect.

742
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:42,520
This phenomenon
occurs primarily

743
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,360
when one dose
of highly lipid

744
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:46,600
-soluble drug
acting on the brain

745
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:51,320
and spinal cord is
administered rapidly

746
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:54,580
by intravenous injection
or by inhalation.

747
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:56,900
Many anesthetics,
well, a few

748
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:58,760
anesthetics are
by inhalation.

749
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:02,520
The drug rapidly
distributes to the CNS,

750
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:05,680
moves down the
concentration gradient into

751
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,860
the CNS tissues, and
produces its effect.

752
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:13,430
The drug then moves
back into the blood

753
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:15,920
as it is taken up
by the less vascular

754
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:19,400
tissues, which, and
here's the key point,

755
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:22,780
terminates the
CNS effect.

756
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:31,020
But, IV administration
of drug moves to

757
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:36,820
CNS, produces its
effect, then it quickly

758
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:40,200
terminates the CNS
effect as it moves

759
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,220
out of the CNS
tissue back into the

760
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:46,400
bloodstream. Now,
this is not related to

761
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:49,400
the drug moving out
of the body, being

762
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:53,040
excreted by the
body. It's just the

763
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:58,060
redistribution into
the peripheral tissues.

764
00:47:58,060 --> 00:48:00,040
That's the concept.

765
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:04,460
Termination of
CNS effect of

766
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:06,540
this highly lipid
-soluble drug.

767
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,840
One dose by
redistribution

768
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:11,680
to the peripheral
tissues.

769
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:13,200
That's it.

770
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:21,240
Distribution across
the placenta. The fetus

771
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,700
is to some extent
exposed to all drugs,

772
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:26,300
or nearly all drugs,
taken by the mother.

773
00:48:28,090 --> 00:48:30,680
Placental transfer
of drugs across the

774
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:34,200
placenta may cause
anomalies in the developing

775
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:37,380
fetus. So the general
determinants of

776
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:43,700
drugs that can produce
important levels

777
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:47,640
in the fetus's
bloodstream, systemic

778
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:51,340
circulation, are the
lipid solubility of the

779
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:54,580
drug. If it's lipid
-soluble, it can, as

780
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:57,560
you know, can cross
physiologic membranes.

781
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:01,380
If the drug is
highly protein-bound,

782
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:05,920
then there is a
lower amount of free

783
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,820
drug that can
cross the lipid

784
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:11,900
membranes. But it
could still be enough.

785
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:16,480
Fetal plasma is
slightly more acidic

786
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,700
than the mother,
so thinking

787
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:20,920
about ion-trapping
of basic drugs.

788
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:28,800
P-glycoprotein and other
export transporters

789
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:33,340
are part of that blood
placenta barrier.

790
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:37,980
So they function
to limit the fetal

791
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:41,480
exposure of certain
drugs. Drugs that

792
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:44,360
are substrates of
poor P-glycoprotein.

793
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:50,140
Now drug reservoirs.

794
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:53,840
I've mentioned this
a few times by now.

795
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:56,520
Drug reservoirs
and other, think

796
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:59,900
about storage
sites, storage.

797
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:05,520
Reversible binding,
and that's how

798
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:11,660
these are. The
drugs are 99.999999%

799
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:15,600
reversible binding
to the inert plasma

800
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:19,160
proteins and inert
tissue macromolecules

801
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:22,780
tends to sequester
the drug in those

802
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:24,180
compartments. So
what does that mean?

803
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:35,500
Drugs on inert
molecules are not free.

804
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:40,200
They are not free
to be metabolized.

805
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,360
They are not free
to be excreted. They

806
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:45,720
are not free to
travel to their

807
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:49,060
site of action or
anywhere else. They

808
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:52,520
are riding around
on the albumin bus.

809
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:57,400
Albumin is the major
plasma protein that

810
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,820
we're thinking about
when it comes to

811
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:03,720
sequestering of drugs
on plasma proteins.

812
00:51:05,770 --> 00:51:09,480
Drugs that bind to tissue

813
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:12,660
macromolecules stay
in the tissues.

814
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:15,240
Now this is
reversible, don't

815
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:17,040
forget, reversible
binding.

816
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,680
So the drugs can be on

817
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:23,500
and off and on and off.

818
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:28,940
And the extent
depends on their

819
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:31,320
affinity for those
plasma proteins

820
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:33,820
and the concentration
of drug.

821
00:51:38,650 --> 00:51:41,510
Looking at our plasma
protein concept here,

822
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:45,130
we have our drug protein

823
00:51:45,130 --> 00:51:47,390
complex and free drug.

824
00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:50,150
This is in dynamic

825
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:54,050
equilibrium at
steady state.

826
00:51:54,130 --> 00:51:59,230
So steady state
occurs with continuous

827
00:51:59,230 --> 00:52:03,110
dosing. Either it's an
IV dose that's going

828
00:52:03,110 --> 00:52:06,750
in by continuous
infusion or it's dosed

829
00:52:06,750 --> 00:52:09,990
by any route of
administration that goes in

830
00:52:09,990 --> 00:52:15,530
at a frequency, at
a regular frequency.

831
00:52:15,570 --> 00:52:17,830
So that's what we
mean by continuous

832
00:52:17,830 --> 00:52:19,770
dosing. And it
gets to the point

833
00:52:19,770 --> 00:52:23,650
where there is
dynamic equilibrium.

834
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:28,630
Here's our free
drug molecules in

835
00:52:28,630 --> 00:52:31,170
plasma in this figure,
and you can see

836
00:52:31,170 --> 00:52:34,530
they pass through the
spaces and capillaries

837
00:52:34,530 --> 00:52:36,370
and they move
into the tissues.

838
00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:39,390
The bound drug does not.

839
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:45,310
That's the basic idea.

840
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,590
We'll talk more about

841
00:52:47,590 --> 00:52:49,150
that in a future lecture.

842
00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:52,970
Oh, sorry.

843
00:52:54,330 --> 00:52:55,410
Okay.

844
00:52:57,430 --> 00:53:00,190
Okay, so some of
the features of drug

845
00:53:00,190 --> 00:53:02,470
binding to these inert
molecules, meaning

846
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:05,430
they don't have a
regulatory effect,

847
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:08,030
they're important,
but they don't cause,

848
00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:10,890
when they're, they
don't have, they're

849
00:53:10,890 --> 00:53:12,870
not activated and
producing some

850
00:53:12,870 --> 00:53:18,490
biologic effect as on
molecules, on cells.

851
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:24,210
drug binding is non
-selective so that

852
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:28,770
means a wide variety
of different chemical

853
00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:33,470
structures can
be bound to the

854
00:53:33,470 --> 00:53:38,100
plasma protein it's
variable saturable

855
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:41,030
there are only just
so many molecules of

856
00:53:41,030 --> 00:53:44,350
albumin floating
around in the blood it

857
00:53:44,350 --> 00:53:46,930
is non-linear meaning
it's saturable

858
00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:50,470
and it is reversible.

859
00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:56,650
So on and off
and on and off

860
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,530
in a dynamic equilibrium.

861
00:53:58,930 --> 00:54:03,150
The fraction bound is
determined by how much

862
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:05,830
drug there is. So the
drug concentration.

863
00:54:08,110 --> 00:54:12,290
What is the affinity
of that plasma protein

864
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:14,070
for the drug? If
it has no affinity,

865
00:54:14,070 --> 00:54:16,350
it won't bind the
drug. or it might have

866
00:54:16,350 --> 00:54:18,470
high affinity and
bind the drug tightly,

867
00:54:18,470 --> 00:54:20,610
but it's usually
somewhere in the middle.

868
00:54:21,770 --> 00:54:26,370
And albumin has a
number of binding sites.

869
00:54:27,090 --> 00:54:28,950
It could be
binding a number of

870
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:31,230
different molecules
at the same time.

871
00:54:31,370 --> 00:54:34,410
So if there are
a large number,

872
00:54:34,410 --> 00:54:37,370
then it's got a big
capacity to bind

873
00:54:37,370 --> 00:54:38,810
drugs. If there's
a small number

874
00:54:38,810 --> 00:54:41,370
available, then a
smaller capacity.

875
00:54:43,790 --> 00:54:46,590
Competition and
disease related factors

876
00:54:46,590 --> 00:54:49,510
can determine the
extent of drug binding.

877
00:54:53,550 --> 00:54:56,310
So here's a check
your knowledge

878
00:54:56,310 --> 00:54:59,770
and perhaps you
would like to

879
00:55:01,030 --> 00:55:03,610
pause the video
and try and answer

880
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:06,470
these on your own.
So you may pause now.

881
00:55:08,050 --> 00:55:10,410
and welcome back. I hope

882
00:55:10,410 --> 00:55:12,270
you gave this
some thought.

883
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:14,570
Oral drugs are
absorbed mainly

884
00:55:14,570 --> 00:55:16,430
from what part
of the intestine?

885
00:55:17,110 --> 00:55:19,810
What is the clinical
significance of the

886
00:55:19,810 --> 00:55:22,590
phenomenon of redistribution
when applied to

887
00:55:22,590 --> 00:55:25,390
highly lipophilic drugs
such as anesthetics?

888
00:55:25,570 --> 00:55:28,170
What is the concern
about drugs that

889
00:55:28,170 --> 00:55:30,250
can cross the blood
placenta barrier?

890
00:55:30,570 --> 00:55:32,750
And what is the
clinical relevance

891
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:34,150
of drug binding to plasma

892
00:55:34,150 --> 00:55:36,570
proteins and tissue
macromolecules.

893
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,810
Drugs are absorbed
mainly from the

894
00:55:41,810 --> 00:55:44,030
upper small intestine,
which has a very

895
00:55:44,030 --> 00:55:46,210
large surface
area for absorbing

896
00:55:46,210 --> 00:55:50,070
nutrients and drugs,
because of villi along

897
00:55:50,070 --> 00:55:52,210
the length of the
small intestine.

898
00:55:53,810 --> 00:55:58,790
The redistribution
refers to a drug that

899
00:55:58,790 --> 00:56:02,570
will go immediately
to the CNS, produce

900
00:56:02,570 --> 00:56:06,310
the CNS effect,
and as the drug is

901
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:10,250
redistributed to the
peripheral tissue,

902
00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:14,550
the plasma concentration
of the drug is

903
00:56:14,550 --> 00:56:18,770
reduced and the CNS
effect is diminished.

904
00:56:20,950 --> 00:56:24,290
Drugs able to cross the
blood placenta barrier

905
00:56:24,290 --> 00:56:28,130
can lead to fetal
exposure of the drug.

906
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:31,650
Practitioners need to
know what drugs are

907
00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:36,370
safe, what drugs are
toxic to the fetus, and

908
00:56:36,370 --> 00:56:41,190
at which stages of the
pregnancy. This is a

909
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:45,990
must-know that we will
talk about as we go

910
00:56:45,990 --> 00:56:50,130
through these various
drug classes later on.

911
00:56:51,410 --> 00:56:53,350
Plasma proteins
and tissue

912
00:56:53,350 --> 00:56:55,610
macromolecules
are inert. They do

913
00:56:55,610 --> 00:56:57,650
not regulate
cellular actions.

914
00:56:57,830 --> 00:57:02,310
Drugs reversibly bound
to plasma proteins

915
00:57:02,310 --> 00:57:04,750
or tissue macromolecules
are sequestered.

916
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:07,750
They're not free
to be metabolized,

917
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:09,750
excreted, or reach
the site of action.

918
00:57:09,890 --> 00:57:13,250
As the concentration
of free drug decreases

919
00:57:13,250 --> 00:57:15,790
due to elimination,
drug molecules

920
00:57:15,790 --> 00:57:18,770
dissociate, which
maintains the free drug

921
00:57:18,770 --> 00:57:22,250
concentration at a
constant fraction.

922
00:57:25,890 --> 00:57:31,610
And in summary, this
is a little mind

923
00:57:31,610 --> 00:57:35,810
map of the
pharmacokinetic processes.

924
00:57:37,410 --> 00:57:40,490
The physicochemical
characteristics of

925
00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:42,890
a drug determine its
ability to withstand

926
00:57:42,890 --> 00:57:45,390
digestive fluids
and enzymes and be

927
00:57:45,390 --> 00:57:48,250
absorbed from the
GI tract, cross

928
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:51,230
physiologic barriers,
survive metabolic

929
00:57:51,230 --> 00:57:54,030
processes. distribute
to the site of action

930
00:57:54,030 --> 00:57:57,110
in therapeutic
concentrations and exit

931
00:57:57,110 --> 00:58:00,130
the site of action
and be eliminated.

932
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:02,790
Drugs move along
their concentration

933
00:58:02,790 --> 00:58:05,210
gradients by passive
diffusion across the

934
00:58:05,210 --> 00:58:08,090
lipid bilayer of
cell membranes or by

935
00:58:08,090 --> 00:58:11,730
carrier or channel
-mediated transport.

936
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:14,890
Drugs may also be
pumped out by energy

937
00:58:14,890 --> 00:58:18,770
-dependent active
transport. very large

938
00:58:18,770 --> 00:58:22,710
or lipid-insoluble
drugs may enter or exit

939
00:58:22,710 --> 00:58:25,990
cells by endocytosis
or pinocytosis,

940
00:58:25,990 --> 00:58:29,090
which I didn't actually
mention before.

941
00:58:29,410 --> 00:58:32,750
This applies to
so few drugs.

942
00:58:34,490 --> 00:58:37,890
The rate and extent of
flow of drug molecules

943
00:58:37,890 --> 00:58:41,180
are influenced by
the magnitude of a

944
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:46,500
concentration gradient
across the membrane, lipid

945
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:49,950
solubility, that is
to say lipid water

946
00:58:49,950 --> 00:58:52,830
partition coefficient,
membrane surface area,

947
00:58:52,830 --> 00:58:56,210
thickness, and
permeability. Weak acids and

948
00:58:56,210 --> 00:58:58,490
weak bases are present
in solution as both a

949
00:58:58,490 --> 00:59:01,610
non-ionized and ionized
species. The non

950
00:59:01,610 --> 00:59:04,810
-ionized molecules usually
are more lipid soluble

951
00:59:04,810 --> 00:59:06,850
and can diffuse
readily across the cell

952
00:59:06,850 --> 00:59:10,050
membrane, whereas the
ionized molecules usually

953
00:59:10,050 --> 00:59:12,350
are less able to
********* the lipid

954
00:59:12,350 --> 00:59:15,650
membrane because of their
low lipid solubility.

955
00:59:16,230 --> 00:59:18,270
Transmembrane
distribution is

956
00:59:18,270 --> 00:59:21,710
determined by the
drugs pKa and the

957
00:59:21,710 --> 00:59:25,090
pH gradient across
the membrane.

958
00:59:26,710 --> 00:59:28,670
Different routes
of administration

959
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:30,690
are used in clinical
medicine for

960
00:59:30,690 --> 00:59:33,410
various reasons,
such as convenience,

961
00:59:33,410 --> 00:59:35,930
rapid onset of
action, maximizing

962
00:59:35,930 --> 00:59:38,090
concentration at
the site of action,

963
00:59:38,350 --> 00:59:40,310
avoiding first
-pass effect,

964
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:43,090
and minimizing
adverse effects.

965
00:59:43,150 --> 00:59:45,890
The rate and extent
of drug distribution

966
00:59:45,890 --> 00:59:47,910
are determined by
the physico-chemical

967
00:59:47,910 --> 00:59:51,870
properties of the drug and
the physiologic factors

968
00:59:51,870 --> 00:59:55,550
of cardiac output,
regional blood flow,

969
00:59:55,670 --> 00:59:58,990
capillary permeability,
and tissue volume.

970
00:59:59,430 --> 01:00:02,050
Extensive binding to
inert proteins and

971
01:00:02,050 --> 01:00:05,050
other macromolecules
may slow the rate at

972
01:00:05,050 --> 01:00:07,090
which a drug reaches
the site of action

973
01:00:07,090 --> 01:00:10,670
and may prolong the
duration of action as

974
01:00:10,670 --> 01:00:14,230
the drugs are sequestered
in the tissues.

975
01:00:16,870 --> 01:00:19,970
These are the tables
I mentioned before.

976
01:00:20,510 --> 01:00:24,230
It tells you the
root, the absorption

977
01:00:24,230 --> 01:00:26,290
pattern, what
they're useful

978
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:30,990
for, and potential
disadvantages.

979
01:00:32,850 --> 01:00:35,990
There are lots of
roots. Most of this is

980
01:00:35,990 --> 01:00:38,450
intuitive. you probably
know it already,

981
01:00:40,180 --> 01:00:43,430
but you do need to know
it. As a physician,

982
01:00:43,430 --> 01:00:47,900
it's so so important
to be able to

983
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:50,040
select the right route
of administration.

984
01:00:51,670 --> 01:00:56,050
And that concludes
part one of our

985
01:00:56,050 --> 01:01:00,470
pharmacokinetics
ADME, administration,

986
01:01:00,470 --> 01:01:03,230
distribution, metabolism,
and excretion.
