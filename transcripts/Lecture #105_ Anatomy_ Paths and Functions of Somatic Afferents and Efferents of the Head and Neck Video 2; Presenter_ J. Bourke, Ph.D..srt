Video number 2,

4
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:09,290
Cranial Nerves 5 and 7.

5
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:12,450
Okay,

6
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:14,770
strap in for
this one, folks.

7
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:17,450
Although this video
only covers two of

8
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:20,950
the 12 cranial nerves,
these two nerves have

9
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:23,690
the most complicated
distribution in

10
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,710
the head and neck, as
they are responsible

11
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,730
for most of the
innervation in the head.

12
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:30,450
We are only asking
you to remember a

13
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:32,730
fraction of the
myriad branches that

14
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:35,530
form from these
two cranial nerves.

15
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:39,170
Now, for your sanity
and mine, I highly

16
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:41,570
recommend that you
don't focus too

17
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,590
much on the course
that these nerves

18
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,630
take as they move
through the head.

19
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:48,970
Instead, for each
branch discussed,

20
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:51,510
try to answer these
three questions.

21
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,030
What root or division is

22
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,150
the nerve coming from?

23
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:57,470
What exit does
it use for the

24
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:58,790
endocranium
and the skull?

25
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:00,270
This can occasionally

26
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,670
have two answers to it.

27
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:04,390
What does the
nerve innervate?

28
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:07,590
Finally, for the
trigeminal nerve,

29
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:10,110
lean heavily on these
dermatome images

30
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,630
from Moore's clinically
-oriented anatomy.

31
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:15,590
Understanding this
distribution of trigeminal

32
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:18,370
across the face will
go a long way to

33
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,970
answering trigeminal
-focused questions.

34
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:23,050
Now that we've prepared,

35
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:24,490
it's time to get started.

36
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:29,070
Cranial Nerve
5 – Trigeminal

37
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:32,250
This is the largest
cranial nerve and is

38
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,770
responsible for most
of the sensation

39
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:35,950
to the head. The
name trigeminal is

40
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:38,450
derived from the Latin
word for triplet and

41
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:40,530
refers to the nerve's
unique branching

42
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,930
pattern off the
brain. The trigeminal

43
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,810
nerve originates
from the pons as a

44
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:47,130
collection of nerve
rootlets that travel a

45
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:49,790
short distance
anteriorly off the brain.

46
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:53,150
Most of these rootlets
enter a large ganglion

47
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,310
located lateral to
the cavernous sinus.

48
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:57,890
This is the
trigeminal ganglion.

49
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:00,270
Distal to the
trigeminal ganglion,

50
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,010
trigeminal
splits into three

51
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:04,050
different nerves
or divisions,

52
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:06,330
the triplets
of trigeminal.

53
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,950
These three big
divisions are

54
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:12,970
ophthalmic, maxillary,
and mandibular.

55
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:17,650
Also called cranial
nerves 5.1, 5.2, and

56
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:21,330
5.3, or as you will
likely hear in lab and

57
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:25,910
throughout your
career, V1, V2, and V3.

58
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:29,370
Let's take each
division one at a time.

59
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:32,890
Trigeminal 5
.1, ophthalmic.

60
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:36,090
This is the smallest
of the three divisions.

61
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,330
It arises from the
trigeminal ganglion

62
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:40,510
and follows a course
very similar to the

63
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:43,230
previous cranial nerves
discussed in video 1.

64
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:46,170
Ophthalmic travels
through the lateral wall

65
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:49,130
of the cavernous sinus
and exits the endocranium

66
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:51,550
through the superior
orbital fissure.

67
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,110
Ophthalmic comes from
the ancient Greek

68
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:57,070
word for the eye. The
name informs us about

69
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:59,390
what the nerve does
and where it goes.

70
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:03,050
Ophthalmic is a purely
sensory nerve. It

71
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:05,050
provides sensation to
the front of the face

72
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,010
above the eyebrows
and will send and

73
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:10,090
extensions posteriorly
to the occipital bone.

74
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:13,090
Once beyond the superior
orbital fissure,

75
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,070
the ophthalmic nerve
splits into three

76
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:19,010
nerves – frontal,
nasociliary, and lacrimal.

77
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,090
The frontal nerve
travels along

78
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:23,850
the roof of the
orbit and further

79
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:26,310
splits into two
terminal nerves.

80
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:29,590
The first nerve is the
supraorbital nerve.

81
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,750
It provides sensory
innervation to the skin

82
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,630
of the scalp, forehead,
and upper eyelid.

83
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:37,370
The supraorbital
nerve exits the

84
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:40,530
skull via the
supraorbital foramen or

85
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,290
supraorbital
notch, depending on

86
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,050
how well-developed
that opening is.

87
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:46,370
The second terminal
branch of the frontal

88
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:49,650
nerve is the
supratrochlear nerve. As

89
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,830
its name implies, the
nerve lies just above

90
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:54,050
the trochlea on the
medial wall of the

91
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:57,110
orbit. It exits the
skull via the medial

92
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:59,610
orbital rim and
provides sensory

93
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:02,210
innervation to the
midline of the brow ridge.

94
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:04,770
The next branch
from the ophthalmic

95
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:07,150
division is the
nasociliary nerve.

96
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:10,010
This nerve initially
follows the frontal

97
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:11,930
nerve before
splitting off to

98
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:14,250
travel inferior to
the optic nerve and

99
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,990
more anteromedially
through the orbit.

100
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:18,890
Here, it splits into

101
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:20,670
several terminal
branches.

102
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:23,710
Two of those branches
form the anterior

103
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:26,230
and posterior
ethmoidal nerves.

104
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:28,630
These go through the
medial wall of the

105
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,250
orbit to enter into
the ethmoid bone, where

106
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,790
they traverse the
nasal cavity and

107
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:35,690
paranasal sinuses, providing
sensory innervation

108
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:37,690
to the structures
in these regions.

109
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:40,310
Returning to the
nasociliary nerve,

110
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,850
as it passes over
the optic nerve, the

111
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:45,390
nasociliary nerve
sends off two or three

112
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:48,190
branches called the
long ciliary nerves.

113
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:50,950
These nerves provide
sensation to the

114
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,630
rest of the eyeball
and act as conduits

115
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,490
for sympathetic
nerve fibers coming

116
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:57,690
from the superior
cervical ganglion.

117
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:00,030
The final branch
of the nasociliary

118
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:02,710
nerve is the
infratrochlear nerve.

119
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,230
As its name implies,
infratrochlear travels

120
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:09,090
inferior to the trochlea
along the medial

121
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:11,670
wall of the orbit
before exiting the skull

122
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:14,310
via the medial
orbital rim to provide

123
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,770
cutaneous innervation
to most of the nose,

124
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:19,790
eyelids, and conjunctiva.
The final branch of

125
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:21,710
the ophthalmic division
is the lacrimal

126
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:24,210
nerve. This is the
smallest nerve off the

127
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:26,370
ophthalmic division and
is the only nerve that

128
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:29,110
travels laterally
after the trifurcation.

129
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:31,210
The lacrimal nerve
travels straight

130
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:32,670
to the lacrimal
gland in the

131
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:35,330
superolateral corner
of the orbital rim.

132
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:37,630
The lacrimal nerve
will provide sensory

133
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:40,550
innervation to the
lacrimal gland. I repeat,

134
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:43,890
sensory innervation.
The motor innervation

135
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:45,990
to the lacrimal gland
comes from elsewhere.

136
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,450
That covers the first

137
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:48,770
division of trigeminal.

138
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:51,490
Time to move on to the
next. cranial nerve

139
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:55,370
5-2, the maxillary. As
with ophthalmic, the

140
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:58,070
maxillary division
is entirely afferent.

141
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:01,150
However, unlike the
ophthalmic division, most

142
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:03,510
of the branches of the
maxillary division go

143
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:06,050
deep into the skull
and are very difficult

144
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:09,010
to see in a dissection.
The maxillary division

145
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:11,590
extends from the
trigeminal ganglion and

146
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:14,410
courses inferrorostrally
into the middle

147
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:17,670
cranial fossa, where it
exits the endocranium

148
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:20,550
via the foramen
rotundum. The maxillary

149
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:23,010
division sends out multiple
nerves to the head.

150
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:26,190
We will focus on just
five of these nerves.

151
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,730
The greater
palatine, the lesser

152
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:31,510
palatine, the
nasopalatine,

153
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:35,050
the zygomatic, and the
infraorbital nerve.

154
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:37,310
Shortly after entering
into the foramen

155
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,330
rotundum, the maxillary
division takes

156
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,470
two different paths
through the skull.

157
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:44,310
One path descends
the skull through an

158
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,810
opening called the
pterygopalatine fossa.

159
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,770
Within this fossa,
multiple branches

160
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:51,050
of the maxillary division

161
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:53,550
enter the
pterygopalatine ganglion.

162
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:56,670
This ganglion acts
as a junction between

163
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:58,590
the trigeminal
and facial nerves.

164
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:01,430
All of the trigeminal
fibers continue through

165
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:05,370
the ganglion without
synapsing. They exit

166
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:08,390
the pterygopalatine
ganglion as three different

167
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:11,590
terminal nerves. The
first two are the

168
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:14,210
greater and lesser
palatine nerves. They will

169
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:17,090
continue inferiorly
through the pterygopalatine

170
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:19,230
fossa until they exit
the skull through

171
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,650
the greater and lesser
palatine foramina.

172
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:24,710
The greater palatine
nerve conveys sensory

173
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,490
information from
the hard palate,

174
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:29,090
whereas the lesser
palatine nerve conveys

175
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:31,490
sensory information
from the soft palate.

176
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:34,210
The final terminal
nerve in this group

177
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:37,210
is the nasopalatine
nerve. This nerve

178
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:39,750
leaves the pterygopalatine
ganglion and

179
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,530
courses rostrally
into the nasal cavity.

180
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:45,390
Here, it provides
sensory innervation to

181
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:47,730
the lower half of
the nasal septum and

182
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:50,390
the mucosa along the
lateral nasal walls.

183
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:53,150
This nerve will
eventually exit the

184
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:55,710
skull through the
incisive canal, where

185
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,570
it provides sensory
innervation to the

186
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:00,010
rostralmost part
of the hard palate.

187
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:02,470
The second path
of the maxillary

188
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:05,010
division runs rosterally
from the foramen

189
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:07,650
rotundum into the
inferior orbital

190
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:10,430
fissure. Within this
fissure, the maxillary

191
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,710
division splits
into two nerves.

192
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:15,870
The first nerve is
the zygomatic nerve.

193
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,970
This nerve courses
along the lateral

194
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,710
wall of the orbit
and splits into

195
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:22,950
two terminal branches,
the zygomaticofacial

196
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:25,170
and zygomaticotemporal
nerves.

197
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:28,330
These two terminal
nerves will exit the

198
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:31,190
skull via foramina
of the same name and

199
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:33,430
go on to provide
sensory innervation to

200
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,570
their respective
portions of the head.

201
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:38,390
The second nerve to
branch within the

202
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,770
inferior orbital
fissure is the aptly

203
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,770
named infraorbital
nerve. The infraorbital

204
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:45,710
nerve courses
along the inferior

205
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:47,910
margin of the orbit
within a small

206
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:50,570
groove called the
infraorbital groove.

207
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,370
Along its course,
the infraorbital

208
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:55,650
nerve sends out
multiple small branches

209
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,730
into the maxillary
sinus and the

210
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:00,110
upper teeth. These
branches form

211
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:03,610
the anterior, middle,
and posterior,

212
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:07,650
superior alveolar
nerves. They provide

213
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:10,270
sensory innervation to
the teeth and gingiva

214
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:12,450
of the upper jaw.
The infraorbital

215
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:15,290
nerve eventually exits
the skull via the

216
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:18,670
infraorbital foramen.
Here, the nerve provides

217
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,110
sensory innervation
for the lower

218
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:22,650
eyelids, sides of the
nose, and upper lip.

219
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:26,070
That's two divisions
down, just one to go.

220
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:28,690
The third and
final division

221
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:30,410
of the trigeminal
nerve is the

222
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:32,710
mandibular
division, or 5-3.

223
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:35,310
This division of
trigeminal stands

224
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:37,290
apart from the rest
as it is the only

225
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:39,630
division that incorporates
a motor component.

226
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:41,870
The motor component
of the mandibular

227
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,670
nerve begins as
motor rootlets

228
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:47,350
leaving the pons.
These rootlets do not

229
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:49,610
pass through the
trigeminal ganglion.

230
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:53,110
Instead, they pass
inferior to the ganglion

231
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:55,570
in an area called
the trigeminal cave.

232
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:58,970
This makes the trigeminal
ganglion a solely

233
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:02,230
sensory ganglion.
Motor and sensory

234
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:05,950
components of 5-3 fuse
together past the trigeminal

235
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:08,130
ganglion to form the
mandibular division

236
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:10,810
of trigeminal, which
then quickly exits

237
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:13,310
the endocranium through
the foramen ovale.

238
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:18,190
The mandibular division
descends the skull

239
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:20,910
through the infratemporal
fossa. This is a

240
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:23,390
soft tissue space that
you will see in lab.

241
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:26,050
Within the fossa, the
mandibular division

242
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:29,050
quickly splits into
four sensory nerves,

243
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:33,270
the auriculotemporal,
the buccal, the lingual,

244
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:36,890
and the inferior
alveolar nerve. The

245
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:39,510
auriculotemporal nerve
provides sensation to

246
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,910
the ears and the temporal
region of the head.

247
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:44,550
The auriculotemporal
nerve is unique as

248
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:48,050
it forms from two separate
roots, the superior

249
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:51,670
and inferior root.
These roots pass around

250
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,700
the middle meningeal
artery before

251
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,630
anastomosing to form the
auriculotemporal nerve.

252
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:59,990
The buccal nerve, or
long buccal nerve,

253
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:02,830
splits off the mandibular
division and courses

254
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:05,550
rostrally through the
infratemporal fossa,

255
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:07,930
passing between both
heads of the lateral

256
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:10,290
pterygoid muscle.
The buccal nerve will

257
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:12,150
provide sensory
innervation to the mucous

258
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:14,430
membranes of the cheeks,
and may also send out

259
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:16,530
branches that provide
accessory sensory

260
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:19,150
innervation to the
second and third molars.

261
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:22,530
Do not confuse the
buccal nerve with

262
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:24,190
the buccal branch
of the facial

263
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:26,370
nerve, which we will
look at in a bit.

264
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:29,390
The buccal nerve is
strictly a sensory

265
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:31,570
nerve that has no
motor components.

266
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:34,550
The inferior alveolar
nerve is largely

267
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:36,830
a continuation of the
mandibular division

268
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:39,050
of trigeminal. It
descends through

269
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:41,210
the infratemporal
fossa and enters

270
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:43,330
the mandible at the
mandibular foramen.

271
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:46,050
From here, the nerve
courses through the

272
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:48,390
mandibular canal,
sending out multiple

273
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:50,610
branches to the teeth
of the mandible.

274
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:53,990
At the rostral, or
mesial, end of the

275
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:56,350
mandibular ramus,
the inferior alveolar

276
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,750
nerve exits the skull
through the mental

277
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,350
foramen. At this
foramen, we change the

278
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,070
name of the nerve
to the mental nerve.

279
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,270
The mental nerve
innervates the

280
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:07,190
skin of the chin
and lower lip.

281
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:09,790
The final sensory
branch of the

282
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:12,170
mandibular division
is the lingual nerve.

283
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:14,970
The lingual nerve branches
off the mandibular

284
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:17,450
division and runs
parallel to the inferior

285
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:19,510
alveolar nerve
through much of the

286
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:22,510
infratemporal fossa.
Near where the inferior

287
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:25,410
alveolar nerve enters
the mandibular foramen,

288
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,890
the lingual nerve
makes a sharp turn

289
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:32,010
rostromedially to enter
the oral cavity. Inside

290
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:34,150
the oral cavity, the
lingual nerve courses

291
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:36,270
into the tongue where
it provides somatic

292
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:39,390
sensory innervation to
the anterior two-thirds

293
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:42,030
of the tongue. That
covers the afferent

294
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,810
component of the
mandibular division of

295
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:46,530
trigeminal. Although the
motor component is the

296
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:49,190
smallest portion of the
mandibular division,

297
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:51,750
these motor actions
are very important.

298
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:54,110
This is because
the motor component

299
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,890
of the mandibular
division innervates

300
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:58,010
all of the muscles
of mastication.

301
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:00,590
These nerves are what
let us chew food.

302
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:04,590
There are five terminal
nerves of importance

303
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:07,110
for mastication.
Each nerve goes to

304
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:09,250
its respective
masticatory muscle, and

305
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,370
they are self
-explanatory. These nerves

306
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:13,070
are all named for
the muscles that they

307
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:15,610
innervate. The only
exception to this is

308
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:18,530
the nerve to
myelohyoid. This nerve

309
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:21,590
innervates both the
myelohyoid muscle and the

310
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:23,730
anterior belly of
the digastric muscle.

311
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:26,470
The nerve to
myelohyoid appears as a

312
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:29,230
split in the inferior
alveolar nerve just

313
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:31,230
before it enters the
mandibular foramen.

314
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:34,330
Whereas the inferior
alveolar nerve takes

315
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:36,310
an intraosseous
course through the

316
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:38,990
mandible, the nerve
to myelohyoid travels

317
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:41,710
externally along the
medial side of the

318
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:44,430
mandibular ramus to
reach its target muscles.

319
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:47,150
The complex interplay
between the various

320
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:49,290
muscles of mastication
and their firing

321
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:52,230
patterns is too detailed
for this video, or

322
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,970
frankly even a first
year of med school.

323
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:55,990
No, really, people
devote entire

324
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:58,250
careers to studying
chewing. For the

325
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,650
purposes of this course,
I would recommend

326
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:03,790
studying figure
8.72 in Mors and

327
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,750
reading the section
on mastication.

328
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,330
Along with that,

329
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:09,270
remember the
following pieces of

330
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:12,110
information. Temporalis,
masseter, and

331
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:15,490
medial pterygoid all
act as jaw closers.

332
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:18,750
Lateral pterygoid,
myelohyoid,

333
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,750
anterior digastric,
and gravity

334
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,990
all act to
open the mouth.

335
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:27,630
There are a few other
muscles that will also

336
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:30,070
act on the jaw, such
as the posterior belly

337
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:33,070
of digastric and
geniohyoid, but they are

338
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:35,630
not considered true
muscles of mastication.

339
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:38,130
We call these accessory
muscles of mastication

340
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:40,430
as it's gravity that's
doing most of the

341
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:43,490
work. The final two
branches of the mandibular

342
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:45,530
division of trigeminal
are the nerves

343
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:48,370
to tensor velle palatine
and tensor tympani.

344
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:51,830
Both nerves arise
from the otic ganglion

345
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:54,000
along with the nerve
to medial pterygoid.

346
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,190
The otic ganglion is
yet another ganglion

347
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:59,670
associated with the
trigeminal nerve, and

348
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,790
it is also yet another
ganglion that the

349
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:04,550
trigeminal nerve merely
passes through without

350
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:07,310
synapsing. The otic
ganglion is important

351
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:09,310
for the autonomics
of the face, which

352
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:11,030
will be dealt with in
a separate lecture.

353
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,950
The nerve to tensor
velle palatine innervates

354
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,850
the muscle of the
same name. This

355
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:18,490
muscle functions in
tensing the soft palate,

356
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:20,110
turning it from
a pliable surface

357
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:22,030
into a stiffened
board that could

358
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,690
be elevated as
a single unit,

359
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,650
allowing for proper
food swallowing.

360
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,410
We'll return to this in

361
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:28,790
more detail in video 3.

362
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:31,350
Importantly, the
tendon of tensor

363
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:33,350
velle palatine
also attaches to

364
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,010
the base of the
eustachian tube.

365
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:37,210
When tensor velle
palatine contracts,

366
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:39,630
it opens the
eustachian tube,

367
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,670
equalizing pressure
on the inside of

368
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:44,510
the ear, causing
your ears to pop.

369
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:47,190
The nerve to tensor
tympani travels

370
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:48,910
to the tensor
tympani muscle in the

371
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,950
ear. This is a
small muscle that

372
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,230
attaches to the
malleus, the ear ossicle

373
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,830
connected to the
tympanic membrane.

374
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:57,770
When tensor tympani
contracts, it stiffens

375
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:59,810
the tympanic membrane,
making it harder

376
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:02,250
for sound waves to
shake the ear ossicles,

377
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:05,310
resulting in dulled
sounds. Tensor tympani

378
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:07,290
activates in
response to very loud

379
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:09,890
sounds and functions
to shield the inner ear

380
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:12,170
from damage in high
-noise environments.

381
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:13,910
We will cover this
in more detail

382
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,730
in this special
afference lecture,

383
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:17,010
clinical correlate.

384
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:19,350
As the hub for somatic
sensory innervation

385
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:21,390
to the face, the
troubles with trigeminal

386
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:24,170
often present as pain
or numbness to portions

387
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:26,590
of the face. A common
clinical problem

388
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:29,590
associated with trigeminal
is trigeminal neuralgia,

389
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:32,190
otherwise known as
tic de la rue. This

390
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:34,530
is the result of
misfiring from one or more

391
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:37,150
sensory branches of
trigeminal on the face.

392
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:39,530
Patients come in
complaining of short

393
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:41,990
-lived but intense
stabbing pains on

394
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:44,390
their face in response
to anything from

395
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:46,690
a gentle touch to
a slight breeze.

396
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:49,410
Tic de la Rue has a
large impact on patient

397
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:51,390
quality of life, with
patients suffering

398
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:53,570
from it going to
great lengths to avoid

399
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:56,210
stimulating the affected
portion of their face.

400
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:58,470
The underlying
causes of Tic de la

401
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,970
Rue are variable
and mostly unknown.

402
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,630
Treatment varies from
local anesthetic to

403
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:06,190
partial or even complete
nerve resection.

404
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,830
Damage to the
motor component of

405
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:10,730
trigeminal often
manifests as

406
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:13,810
temporomandibular
joint or TMJ problems.

407
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:15,950
The proximal cause of
the patient's trouble

408
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:18,170
is usually the joint
itself, but the

409
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,730
underlying issues that
produce TMJ problems

410
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:22,770
in the first place
can be attributed to

411
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:25,090
misfiring of the
muscles of mastication,

412
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:27,550
which can misalign the
teeth, producing jaw

413
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:30,230
tenderness, tooth
damage, and headaches.

414
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,030
Wow,

415
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:35,570
okay. That will cover
all the important

416
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:37,990
branches of the
trigeminal nerve.

417
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,230
Awesome job making
it this far in.

418
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:42,010
It's time to take
a break. Get a good

419
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:43,910
stretch in, maybe
make a sandwich.

420
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,470
But before heading
off and preparing for

421
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:50,050
the facial nerve,
I want to briefly

422
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:51,910
look at this part of
the self-assessment.

423
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:55,090
See how you are asked
to diagrammatically

424
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:56,650
draw out the
branches of the

425
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,950
trigeminal nerve?
I recommend keeping

426
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:01,230
this part simple.
For instance,

427
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:03,090
let's draw the
branches of

428
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:04,950
the ophthalmic
real quick.

429
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:09,970
Here's the brain.

430
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:13,450
There's the trigeminal
ganglion. Off we

431
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:16,430
go to the frontal,
nasociliary and lacrimal

432
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:18,790
nerves. Off frontal
we'll add the

433
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:22,590
supraorbital and supratrochlear.
From nasociliary,

434
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,490
we'll toss in the
ethmoidal nerves,

435
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:27,490
long ciliary nerves,
and the infratrochlear

436
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:29,930
nerve. We can then
put some simple

437
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:32,810
brackets in for the
endocranium exits, some

438
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:34,910
nerve-specific notes
along the side, and

439
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:37,250
finally a note that
everything we just

440
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,090
did was for a nerve
that is only afferent.

441
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:44,870
Of course, you
don't have to do it

442
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:47,190
this way. Feel
free to choose the

443
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:49,190
drawing method that
works best for you.

444
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:51,710
Okay then,
quick break and

445
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:53,110
on to our last
cranial nerve.

446
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:07,750
Cranial nerve 7,
the facial nerve.

447
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:10,830
If the trigeminal
nerve is the main

448
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,710
afferent nerve
for the face, the

449
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:14,650
facial nerve is the
main motor nerve.

450
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:17,110
The facial nerve
innervates all of the

451
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,990
muscles of facial
expression, which are

452
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:21,630
about 20 or so. The
facial nerve also

453
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:24,010
innervates most of the
glands in your head.

454
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:27,070
Glandular innervation
is all autonomic

455
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:28,670
and so will be
covered in a separate

456
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:31,850
autonomics lecture. The
facial nerve starts as

457
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:33,630
two routes that
leave the junction of

458
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,730
the pons and medulla.
The larger route is

459
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:39,010
called the primary
route, or the facial

460
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:41,670
nerve proper. This
route innervates all

461
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:44,390
of the muscles of
facial expression. The

462
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:46,330
smaller route is
called the intermediate

463
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:48,870
route, or intermediate
nerve, as it is

464
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:51,070
the autonomic branch
of the facial nerve.

465
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:53,990
Shortly after leaving
the brain, both

466
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:55,970
routes quickly
combine to form the

467
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:58,470
facial nerve. The
newly formed nerve

468
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:01,090
travels laterally in
the posterior cranial

469
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:03,530
fossa before exiting
the endocranium

470
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:06,450
through the internal
acoustic meatus.

471
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:09,380
The facial nerve shares
this exit with the

472
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:12,010
vestibulocochlear
nerve, cranial nerve 8.

473
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,670
However, the facial
nerve is the only

474
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:16,810
nerve that will later
leave the skull.

475
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:19,430
Shortly after
entering the internal

476
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:21,970
acoustic meatus, the
facial nerve travels

477
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:24,050
posteriorly through
the walls of the middle

478
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:26,510
ear within the facial
canal. Now, this

479
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:28,330
gives the facial
nerve the longest

480
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:31,350
intraosseous course
of any cranial nerve.

481
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:33,430
The area where
the facial nerve

482
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:35,310
changes direction
is called the

483
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:37,150
geniculum of the
facial nerve.

484
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:39,810
Genu is Latin for
knee, and it is

485
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:41,510
here where the
facial nerve expands

486
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,470
into a ganglion
of nerve fibers

487
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:45,230
called the
geniculate ganglion.

488
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:47,600
The geniculate
ganglion is another

489
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,290
ganglion that will
be more important

490
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,910
to you later when
discussing the

491
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:53,150
autonomic component
of the facial nerve.

492
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:56,130
For the purposes of
this video, the ganglion

493
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,690
serves as a helpful
landmark to locate the

494
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:01,230
start of three
branches of the facial

495
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:04,850
nerve. The greater petrosal
nerve, a communicating

496
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:07,210
branch that will join
the lesser petrosal

497
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:10,170
nerve, and the external
petrosal nerve.

498
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:12,480
These three
nerves will send

499
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,270
autonomics from
the facial nerve to

500
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:16,310
various locations
in the head.

501
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:19,030
Beyond the geniculate
ganglion, the

502
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:21,130
facial nerve courses
around the tympanum,

503
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:23,530
making a C-shaped
curve around the

504
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:25,410
middle ear until
the nerve eventually

505
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:28,070
courses anteriorly
through the skull.

506
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:30,910
As the facial nerve
passes by our middle

507
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:33,390
ear ossicle, the
stapes, it will send

508
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:35,590
out a small branch
into the middle ear

509
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:38,150
cavity to innervate
the stapedius muscle.

510
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:40,910
As with tensor tympani,
the stapedius muscle

511
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:43,390
functions as a sound
dampener during times

512
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:46,650
of intense noise. We
will revisit stapedius

513
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:48,850
as well in the special
afference lecture.

514
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:52,230
Continuing antero
-inferiorly around the

515
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:54,030
middle ear, the
facial nerve sends out

516
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:56,910
another special branch
called cordotympani.

517
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:59,290
This nerve briefly
crosses through

518
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:01,390
the middle ear before
exiting the skull

519
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:03,770
through the petro
-tympanic fissure.

520
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,140
Cordotympani will
enter the infratemporal

521
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:08,130
fossa where it joins
with the lingual

522
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:10,930
nerve and rides that
nerve into the tongue.

523
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:13,170
We will return to
cordotympani in the

524
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:14,990
special afference
lecture as well.

525
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:16,690
The remaining
parts of the

526
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:18,430
facial nerve exit
the skull through

527
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:20,310
the stylomastoid foramen.

528
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:23,930
Immediately after
exiting the stylomastoid

529
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:26,410
foramen, the facial
nerve sends a branch

530
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:29,490
posteriorly to wrap
around the ear. This

531
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:32,150
is the posterior
auricular nerve. It will

532
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:34,050
innervate a vestigial
muscle of the ear

533
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:36,610
that pulls the ears
back in other animals.

534
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:39,330
Continuing antero
-inferiorly,

535
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:40,830
the facial nerve
sends out a

536
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:42,910
branch to the
digastric muscle.

537
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:45,370
This branch will
innervate the posterior

538
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:47,910
belly of the
digastric muscle. This

539
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:50,850
gives digastric dual
innervation. The

540
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:53,330
anterior belly receives
innervation from the

541
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:56,110
nerve to myelohyoid,
a branch of 5-3,

542
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:58,390
whereas the posterior
belly gets the

543
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:01,170
digastric branch of
the facial nerve. The

544
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:03,310
rest of the facial
nerve will continue

545
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,910
anteroinferiorly to
enter the parotid

546
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:08,490
gland where it explodes
out to form the

547
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:10,850
parotid plexus deep
within the gland.

548
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:13,350
Here, the facial
nerve splits out

549
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,910
into five different
motor branches.

550
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:18,990
These five branches
innervate all 20

551
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:21,930
or so facial muscles.
The five branches

552
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:24,030
of the parotid plexus
are named based

553
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:26,190
on where they are
going, but in a

554
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:29,170
generally superior to
inferior direction,

555
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:32,690
they are the
temporal, zygomatic,

556
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:35,770
buccal, marginal
mandibular, and

557
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:38,070
cervical branches
of the facial nerve.

558
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:42,030
A popular mnemonic
for remembering the

559
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:44,210
branches of the
facial nerve is To

560
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:47,290
Zanzibar by Motor Car
However, there are

561
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:49,290
dozens of alternative
mnemonics as

562
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:51,910
well, such as Tiny
Zebras Bit My Cheeks,

563
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:54,390
as well as several
dirtier versions

564
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:56,850
Now, the distribution
pattern of

565
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:58,150
the parotid plexus
that I've shown

566
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:00,310
here is a very
general pattern

567
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:02,530
Cadaveric studies
have found that

568
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:04,950
branching, or
arborization pattern, of

569
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:07,530
the parotid plexus
is highly variable

570
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:10,670
You will be tested
on this ideal version

571
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:12,510
I've shown here
for the purpose of

572
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:14,390
learning the
material, but don't be

573
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:16,450
surprised if the donors
in lab don't show

574
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:18,270
this same pattern
as few people will

575
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:20,610
have this exact
pattern in real life.

576
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:23,290
Of all the branches
of the parotid plexus,

577
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:24,990
the most important
one to understand

578
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:27,590
is the buccal branch
of the facial nerve.

579
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:29,230
This branch innervates

580
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:30,450
the buccinator muscle,

581
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:32,730
a facial muscle that
tenses the cheeks,

582
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:34,810
allowing for
suckling, *******,

583
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:36,910
whistling, brass
instrument playing, etc.

584
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:40,090
Do not confuse the buccal
branch of the facial

585
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:42,850
nerve with the buccal
nerve of trigeminal.

586
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:45,150
The former is the
motor innervation for

587
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:48,130
buccinator. The latter is
the sensory innervation

588
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:50,890
of the cheek mucosa.
When you suck your

589
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:52,870
cheeks into your mouth,
you are using the

590
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:55,410
buccal branch of facial.
When you feel the

591
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,770
pain of accidentally
biting those cheeks, you

592
00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:00,270
are using the buccal
nerve from trigeminal.

593
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:03,750
Clinical correlate
The most common

594
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,190
clinical correlate
associated with

595
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:07,150
the facial nerve
is Bell's palsy.

596
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:09,650
This is the result
of a lesion to one or

597
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:11,990
more branches of the
parotid plexus, resulting

598
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:14,110
in partial to complete
paralysis of the

599
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:16,370
muscles of facial expression
on the ipsilateral

600
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:18,410
side of the face
where the lesion is.

601
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:20,890
Bell's palsy is often

602
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:22,650
idiopathic and temporary.

603
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:25,650
However, in some cases,
such as with Sylvester

604
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:28,290
Stallone, Bell's palsy
can be permanent.

605
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:30,830
In the case of Stallone,
his was acquired

606
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,650
during birth, where
labor complications

607
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:35,110
forced the doctor to
use forceps. In the

608
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:37,530
process, the doctor
accidentally damaged some

609
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:39,910
branches of his right
parotid plexus, producing

610
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:41,930
his characteristic
facial expression.

611
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:47,730
Congratulations on
surviving our whirlwind

612
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:49,850
tour of the two most
complicated cranial

613
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:52,330
nerves in the head.
It's time for a break.

614
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:55,550
This brings us to
the end of video two.
