00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,720
Hello, I'm Dr. Brooke
Schaud-Laurent.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,420
I'm an osteopathic family

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:06,600
medicine physician.

4
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,980
I'm an associate
professor

5
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,720
and chair for
the Department

6
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:11,900
of Clinical Medicine

7
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,640
at NYIT College
of Osteopathic

8
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,840
Medicine at Arkansas
State University.

9
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,740
I also serve as
the executive

10
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:20,480
director for the
Delta Population

11
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,260
Health Institute
at NYIT-COM,

12
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:24,420
the community engagement

13
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:25,960
arm for the
medical school.

14
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,460
Today, my presentation
will be on health

15
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,720
disparities, Closing
the Gap Through Cultural

16
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:36,340
Competencies. This is
one of two parts. In

17
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:43,500
the first part of this
presentation, we'll

18
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,200
be defining what are
health disparities,

19
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,580
explain the contributing

20
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,540
factors of health
disparities,

21
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,940
explain how social
determinants of

22
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,240
health affect
health outcomes, and

23
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,120
explain how
practices in health

24
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,240
care contribute to
health outcomes.

25
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:04,620
There are many
expectations that will be

26
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,900
expected of you as
rising osteopathic

27
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,600
physicians, and this is
one of them, that you

28
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,180
will have a lifelong
commitment to grow

29
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,720
in the discipline of
cultural competency,

30
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,120
to provide quality
health care to

31
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,540
all persons, and
to lead communities

32
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:26,180
holistically
and with equity.

33
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:32,510
this is our definition
of health disparities

34
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:35,640
it's it's the difference
in the incidence

35
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,060
prevalence mortality
and burden of disease

36
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,680
as well as other adverse
health conditions

37
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,400
or outcomes that
exist among specific

38
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,880
populations well documented
in subpopulations

39
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,080
based on socioeconomic
status, education,

40
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,180
age, race,
ethnicity, geography,

41
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:57,440
disability, gender, and

42
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,040
or ****** orientation.

43
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,840
Because of the limitation
of time, we won't

44
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,300
be able to get into
the disparities of all

45
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:08,060
the populations and
demographics. We will

46
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,700
however touch on the
most prevalent ones and

47
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,340
provide references at
the end of this lecture

48
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,420
to learn more about
how other populations

49
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,000
are experiencing health
in the United States.

50
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,760
One of the disparities
that have been

51
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,020
well documented is
life expectancy.

52
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,380
This graph is from
the county health

53
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,450
rankings and shows
health disparities

54
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,280
specifically in life
expectancy among

55
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,060
race and ethnic
groups. The population

56
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,960
with the highest
life expectancy

57
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,500
between 2010 and
2020 is in the Asian

58
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,460
Pacific Islander
population, followed by

59
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,360
the Hispanic
population, then white.

60
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,760
American Indian
and Alaskan Native

61
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,260
follows and then the
Black population.

62
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:56,700
Please note, excuse
me, that this does not

63
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,640
take into account the
change in life expectancies

64
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,180
after the pandemic.
There are recent

65
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,020
studies that have shown
that the gaps have

66
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:07,460
widened for minority
populations. You can see

67
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:11,240
here that the differences
of life expectancy

68
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:16,540
ranges between 10 to
20 years, depending on

69
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:20,460
which people group an
individual is part of.

70
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,990
Another disparity
is unfortunately

71
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:31,310
found in maternal
and child health.

72
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:35,310
In this diagram in
the upper left side,

73
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:38,390
it notes that of all
the preterm births

74
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:43,930
in 2020, 14.4% were in
the Black population

75
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,130
followed by native
hawaiian pacific

76
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:49,210
islanders american indian
and alaskan natives

77
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:52,760
where you have preterm
births children

78
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:56,190
that were born in
preterm have significant

79
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:58,990
chronic illnesses
as a sequelae

80
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:01,090
of preterm birth
a higher risk

81
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:02,650
of having
chronic illnesses

82
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:07,210
as a sequelae for
preterm births in the

83
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:08,870
upper right corner
we're looking at

84
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:11,150
babies born of low
birth rate in 2020.

85
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:15,110
And in this period,
it was captured that

86
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:18,370
14.2% of babies
born of low birth

87
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:21,720
rate were of the black
population followed

88
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:27,110
by native American
Pacific Islanders

89
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:31,050
and then American
Indian Alaskan Natives.

90
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:36,350
For pregnancy
related mortality in

91
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:39,490
the lower left corner
per 100 births,

92
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:43,910
40.8 deaths
per 100 births

93
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,650
occurred in the
black population.

94
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:48,750
The next highly
affected group was the

95
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,050
American Indian, native
Alaskan group by 29

96
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:54,130
.7 per 100 births.
Then followed by the

97
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:58,290
Asian population, 12
.7 per 100,000 births.

98
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:00,650
When you move over to

99
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:02,430
the right lower corner,

100
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:03,870
where there's a
measurement of infant

101
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,970
mortality per 1,000
live births in 2018,

102
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:10,350
again, we see that within
the black population

103
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:13,810
there's a higher rate
10.8 per 1000 live

104
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:18,930
births followed by 9
.4 per 1000 births uh

105
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:21,070
in the native hawaiian
specific pacific

106
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:24,510
islander group and
then followed by 8.2 in

107
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:27,410
american indian alaskan
natives so again these

108
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,590
are these graphs
show some staggering

109
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:33,850
disparities um among
different ethnic and racial

110
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:37,470
groups and it's important
to note not only

111
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:40,570
that they are there
but as osteopathic

112
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:44,210
physicians to understand
why these disparities

113
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:47,090
exist and we'll be
getting into that a little

114
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:53,230
bit later on another
intersection not only

115
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:55,850
lies within race and
ethnicity but also

116
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:59,450
where you live contributes
significantly to

117
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:01,770
your health outcomes
this was an article in

118
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:04,630
rural counties with
majority in health affairs

119
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:07,150
excuse me that had an
article that showed

120
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,650
rural counties with
majority black or

121
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:13,050
indigenous populations
suffer the highest rates

122
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:16,270
of ********* death.
There's a CDC study

123
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:19,730
done in 2017 that noted
the same. It's important

124
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:21,690
to note that when
we're looking at these

125
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:24,150
different populations,
when you have these

126
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:27,020
different demographics
and they're compounded,

127
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:30,830
it puts populations
at significant risk

128
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:36,070
for health outcomes
that are deadly. This

129
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,430
is a map from county
health rankings that

130
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:48,550
breaks down the geography
of counties across

131
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:52,310
the United States.
The areas here that

132
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:56,050
in purple are shown
and have demonstrated

133
00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:00,290
to be the least
healthiest counties. The

134
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:04,050
area that you see
highlighted here is in

135
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:07,590
the Mississippi Delta.
This is the region

136
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:11,490
where the Arkansas
campus is based. And as

137
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:15,170
you can see, along
with areas in Alaska,

138
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:19,760
rural areas here
in the southwest,

139
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:26,190
areas of Appalachia
here and here, Um,

140
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,530
but there are
these significant

141
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:31,610
disparities and, uh,
these counties are

142
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:34,570
encountering
significant challenges.

143
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:37,770
And this map
again shows that

144
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:39,670
where you live
does matter.

145
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:46,150
There have been many
studies to show,

146
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:51,090
um, along a Metro
line, for example, um,

147
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:54,210
this This is a map
of New York City

148
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:58,030
that shows the
Metro lines 456 and

149
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:01,800
line NQR, and
depending what stop

150
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:06,190
you get off of,
it actually does

151
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:10,270
determine what your
life expectancy is.

152
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,250
It could be a difference

153
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,990
of close to 10 years.

154
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:17,430
Here around Lincoln
Center, it's

155
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,870
around 84 years.
If you go to where

156
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:23,370
the Apollo Theater
is, it's 76.

157
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:28,410
If you look at
Queens and Astoria,

158
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:29,870
82 years.

159
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:32,170
So there are a lot
of studies that

160
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:34,130
are looking at what
are the environmental

161
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,790
factors that are
causing these

162
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:41,130
discrepancies and
disparities for

163
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:44,390
life expectancies
in the same state.

164
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:49,490
the map that you see
on the right here shows

165
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:53,090
a similar example
this is a highway in

166
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:55,630
california where depending
what exit that you

167
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:59,470
get off of your life
expectancy could be 81

168
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:02,770
and going further up
north near fresno we

169
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:06,090
could be 75 so as we're
looking at these studies

170
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:09,490
we should be looking
and asking what is

171
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:13,390
going on in these
areas that we have such

172
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:17,970
significant disparities
in life expectancies.

173
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:23,930
What I'm making reference
to here in terms

174
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:28,190
of environmental
factors are what is

175
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:31,230
known as the social
determinants of health.

176
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:33,530
The social determinants
of health are

177
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:35,410
defined are the conditions
in the environments

178
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:38,270
where people are
born, where they live,

179
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:41,220
learn, work, play,
worship, and age that

180
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:44,590
affect a wide range
of health functioning

181
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:48,950
and quality of life
outcomes and risks.

182
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:54,450
The six broad
categories or buckets of

183
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:56,870
social determinants of
health are as follows,

184
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,750
And you'll see some
variation of these

185
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:04,450
in different
organizations, but they

186
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:07,030
pretty much fall in
these broad categories.

187
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:10,170
One is economic
stability, and that is

188
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:13,310
defined by employment,
income, expenses,

189
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:17,090
debt, medical bills,
and the support

190
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:19,530
that they have.
The next category

191
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:20,890
is neighborhood
and physical

192
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:23,730
environment, housing,
transportation,

193
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,170
safety,

194
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:27,870
parks, playgrounds,
walkability, your zip

195
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:31,250
code. All these things
contribute to the

196
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:34,330
health outcomes of an
individual or family.

197
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:37,650
Next is education,
your literacy level,

198
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:39,450
language, early
childhood education,

199
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:43,310
vocational training,
the ability to obtain

200
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:47,030
higher education is
one determinant of

201
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:49,190
health. And the next
one is food security,

202
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:52,110
hunger, access to
healthy options.

203
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:56,210
The next category is
community and social

204
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:59,390
context, such as
social integration,

205
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:02,750
a unit in a family
or communities

206
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,930
that have strong
support systems,

207
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,290
a community that
where there's true,

208
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:09,250
thoughtful community
engagement.

209
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:14,090
areas where there are
discrimination and

210
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:17,030
stress can act and
be a significant

211
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:21,330
determinant of health
and the sixth bucket is

212
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:23,630
health care system
health care coverage

213
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:26,590
provide availability
provider linguistic

214
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:28,850
and cultural competency
and quality of

215
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:32,630
care for the most
part you as a rising

216
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:37,110
osteopathic physician
will have the most

217
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:42,350
authority and influence
in this last column.

218
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,950
And for the most
part, for the rest of

219
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:50,370
your education, it will
be focusing on your

220
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:53,150
competencies as a
healthcare professional

221
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:56,410
in providing care
that is culturally

222
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:59,050
appropriate and providing
quality of care.

223
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:02,430
But it's important
to be aware that

224
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,870
these other
columns here are

225
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:08,110
significant drivers
in health outcomes,

226
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:10,050
more so than health
care systems.

227
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:12,910
Health outcomes
are defined as

228
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:16,450
mortality, morbidity,
life expectancy,

229
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,850
health care expenditures,

230
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:21,370
health status, and
functional limitations.

231
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:34,540
So the county health
rankings shows and

232
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:37,160
provides a diagram
that is very helpful

233
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,200
to see, well, how
much does clinical

234
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,260
care contribute to
health outcomes? So in

235
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,060
this diagram, health
outcome is defined

236
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,720
by length of life
and quality of life.

237
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,300
The areas here are
the health factors

238
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,580
such as health
behaviors, clinical care,

239
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,280
social economic factors,

240
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,400
physical environment.

241
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:03,060
And it looks like if
you want to have the

242
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:06,160
greatest and the best
movement of improvement

243
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,160
for health outcomes,
the areas that you

244
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,340
have to affect are
health behaviors, social

245
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,900
economic factors, and
physical environment.

246
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:18,520
Clinical care is just
20%. It is significant.

247
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,420
There are significant
issues that happen

248
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,500
in a clinical setting
that you will learn

249
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:27,240
how to avoid and
advocate for patients'

250
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,420
health through these
presentations and the

251
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,940
rest of your education.
But it's also important

252
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,680
to know as an
osteopathic physician,

253
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:38,100
because we know that if
you approach something,

254
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,880
understanding that
you have to look at

255
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,820
the systems also outside
the human body, where

256
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:46,120
they live, learn,
work, play, and pray.

257
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:48,900
If you're aware of those
things, you will be

258
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,640
a better osteopathic
physician, because as

259
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,490
you're taking those
things into consideration,

260
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:56,320
you'll be able to
customize the appropriate

261
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,680
care for the patient
that is before you.

262
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,340
one of the greatest

263
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:07,960
misconception in
uh disparities

264
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:13,040
when they're being
observed is that race

265
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,460
is a biological factor
and nothing can be

266
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:18,700
further than the truth
it is actually the

267
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,900
act of discrimination
because of race or

268
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,200
any other and a
reason against people

269
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,540
that's a significant
driver of health

270
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:30,480
disparities and a clear
example of this is in

271
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,100
the practice and
the legalization of

272
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:37,820
redlining redlining was
a federally supported

273
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,960
discriminate
discriminatory law that

274
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,960
prohibited the granting
of loans to black

275
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,700
individuals and families
which kept black

276
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,700
people and families
from owning properties

277
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,940
forcing them to live
in designated areas.

278
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,080
These areas have
generationally have

279
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,780
been disinvested so
that economic mobility

280
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:59,140
and stability is
almost non-existent.

281
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,280
Education, options
for healthy foods,

282
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,980
healthy spaces are not
equitable in areas that

283
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,680
were invested where
people could get

284
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,780
loans and buy property.
And these were and

285
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:12,180
are the major drivers
of health outcomes.

286
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,680
The maps that
you see before

287
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,760
you are maps
of Minneapolis.

288
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:19,040
The one on the
left are the areas

289
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,800
that have been
redlined. They have the

290
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,440
highest concentration
of people of

291
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,620
color between 1930s
and 1970 by way

292
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:29,340
of discriminatory
law and practices.

293
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,940
The map on your
right shows the areas

294
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,660
of high infant
mortality in the same

295
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:38,860
Minneapolis area
between 2001 and 2010.

296
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:43,920
these areas are the
same areas that were

297
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,900
redlined the areas that
were redlined are the

298
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,820
areas where you have the
highest concentration

299
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:54,140
of infant mortality
this is an example

300
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:57,620
of structural racism
while there aren't any

301
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:02,800
anti-discrimination
laws or or or blatant

302
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,540
discrimination laws to
date The vestiges of

303
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:10,040
legalized discrimination
are lived experiences

304
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,620
for people today
because of these laws.

305
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,840
The environmental
factors and determinants

306
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,020
of health caused
by redlining are

307
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:21,240
causing high rate
of infant mortality.

308
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:25,420
So it's important to
note that you have

309
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,560
to look at the history
of the conditions

310
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,480
of where people
live. That affects

311
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,320
the options and
opportunities of health

312
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,260
that are driving
the health outcomes.

313
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,560
Dr. Williams
published an article

314
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,300
on racism and
health in the Annual

315
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,160
Review of Public
Health in 2019.

316
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,340
It is a significant
publication that I

317
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:50,840
encourage you to review
to better understand

318
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:54,880
how the patterns of
racial, ethnic inequities

319
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,280
in health exist,
and we also need to

320
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,020
learn more about it
because we see that

321
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,720
there are rates of
disease and death that

322
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,760
are elevated for
historically marginalized

323
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,220
racial groups such as
black native americans

324
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,360
native hawaiians and
pacific islanders

325
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:13,640
and if you were
to adjust for

326
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,420
socioeconomic
status which

327
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,000
means if you were
to look at the

328
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:21,080
people groups who
have the same salary

329
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,600
or socioeconomic status
you still will see

330
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,480
a disparity amongst
ethnic and racial

331
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,320
groups which shows
that it's more than

332
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,440
the amount of money
one may have in their

333
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,580
bank account or their
financial assets.

334
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:37,220
Research indicates
that across virtually

335
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,600
every type of
diagnostic and treatment

336
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,680
intervention,
****** and other

337
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,880
minorities receive fewer
procedures and poor

338
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,220
quality medical
care than ****** do.

339
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,900
So there is a
significant issue that is

340
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,900
going on in a
healthcare system that

341
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,360
is really important
for you as a rising

342
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,700
osteopathic physician
to be aware of.

343
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:02,480
another population is
the lgbtq population

344
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,080
um significant
groups uh significant

345
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,220
groups are um within
the lgbt groups

346
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:12,360
are delaying health
care because of concern

347
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:15,940
and fear of
discrimination um over

348
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:18,960
50 percent of lgbtq
plus people report

349
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,220
some form of health
care discrimination

350
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:25,540
18 percent of lgbt youth
report experiencing

351
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:30,860
dating violence one out
of five of transgender

352
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,240
people are refused
health care services

353
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:39,640
there's also financial
health disparities

354
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,960
in providing getting
health health care

355
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:46,080
services that is much
higher within lgbtq lgbtq

356
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,480
plus groups So it's
important to be aware,

357
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:54,320
again, of the lack of
access that is causing

358
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,420
health disparities,
but also discriminatory

359
00:18:56,420 --> 00:19:00,060
practices that are
being experienced by

360
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:02,420
different demographics
within the health care

361
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,520
system that's affecting
health outcomes.

362
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:10,120
why we might see these
health disparities

363
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:14,580
specifically in lgbt
groups is that um there's

364
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,940
additional stress
for marginalized

365
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:19,600
persons who experience
discrimination or stigma

366
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,220
there's lack of access
to adequate health

367
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,280
care services due to
bias or discrimination

368
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,800
in the system policy
or provider level.

369
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,300
Inadequate
public knowledge,

370
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,840
attitudes, and systems.

371
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,700
And health promotion
messages tailored

372
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,800
to LGBT communities
fail to realize

373
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:42,300
that ****** orientation
identification

374
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:45,420
is not the same as
****** behavior. And

375
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,120
so there's a lot of
education that needs

376
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,740
to be done in this
area to make sure

377
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:53,240
people have the
care that they need.

378
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,260
Unequal Treatment,
Confronting

379
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,760
Racial and Ethnic
Disparities

380
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,910
in Health Care
was a landmark

381
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,480
publication by
the Institute

382
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,760
of Medicine,
now known as the

383
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,840
National Institute
of Medicine,

384
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,320
excuse me, the
National Academies of

385
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,740
Sciences. This
landmark study called

386
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:26,240
Unequal Treatment
really showed through

387
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,060
a panel of experts
who documented

388
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:31,280
evidence and explored
how persons of color

389
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,440
experience healthcare
environment.

390
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,520
This book examines
how disparities in

391
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,460
treatments may arise in
healthcare systems and

392
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:43,580
looks at aspects of
the clinical encounter

393
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:46,460
that may contribute to
such disparities. um

394
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:50,120
patients and providers
attitudes expectations

395
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:55,040
and behaviors were
analyzed the um document

396
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,940
also talked about
ways we could improve

397
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:04,460
um these uh disparities
that individuals

398
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:07,460
were experiencing
there would be

399
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,860
improvements needed in
medical care financing

400
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:13,080
allocation of care
availability of

401
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,220
language translation
for those who do

402
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:23,550
not have English as
a primary language,

403
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:28,160
community-based care,
and other arenas.

404
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,820
The committee highlights
the potential of

405
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,700
cross-cultural
education to improve

406
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,680
provider-patient
communication and offers

407
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,680
detailed look of how
to integrate cross

408
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,460
-cultural learning within
health professions.

409
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,800
But what has happened

410
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,380
since this
landmark report?

411
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:52,140
Well, there was a
presentation done

412
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:55,360
by, presented by
Dr. Brian Smeadley

413
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,370
from the Urban
Institute. He gave a

414
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:00,400
presentation at the
National Academies

415
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,220
of Science in
February of 2023.

416
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:08,260
and essentially
provided a perspective

417
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:13,570
that needed to be
noted, which was, well,

418
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:19,080
the disparities have
not been narrowed from

419
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:22,680
the difference of the
year 2000 to 2021.

420
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:26,030
The Agency for Healthcare
Research Quality

421
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:29,620
published a report
and saw that for

422
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,640
African, for American
Indian, Alaska Native

423
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:35,340
populations, the
disparity was reduced only

424
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:39,060
by 8%. For Asian
populations, 2%. Black

425
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,520
populations, 3%.
Hispanic populations,

426
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,680
4%. Native Hawaiian
Pacific Islanders, 10%.

427
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,020
So we still are seeing
these disparities.

428
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:50,760
And again, please
keep in mind that we

429
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:56,300
are still learning
about how the pandemic

430
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:59,760
it has affected
these health

431
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,580
disparities and
outcomes as well.

432
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:09,200
Dr. Smedley goes on
to point out, well,

433
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,000
what are the factors
that are associated

434
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,960
with healthcare
inequity? And one thing

435
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,120
that was noted is that
there are separate

436
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,340
and inequitable
healthcare systems due

437
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:21,440
to residential
segregation, like we talked

438
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,400
about before we saw
in redlining. You

439
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:27,380
have disinvested
communities where hospitals,

440
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:30,900
communities aren't
investing, having

441
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:34,080
good hospitals in
their area. There's a

442
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,360
maldistribution of
healthcare resources,

443
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,620
health systems, limited
provider networks.

444
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:42,020
There's also a tiered
health insurance

445
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,440
and differences in
provider reimbursement.

446
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:48,200
And this really does
drive the type of

447
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,660
care that individuals
receive. There's

448
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:53,760
clinician biases,
stereotypes, and prejudices,

449
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,320
race-based clinical
decision support,

450
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,440
and algorithms, and
a persistent lack of

451
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,420
diversity among
healthcare professionals.

452
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,620
Dr.

453
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:11,860
Gengopadahaya also
noted that there was a

454
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:14,640
medical apartheid as
there were inequitable

455
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,000
care for patients
of color. The study

456
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,380
investigated the differences
between black and

457
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,400
white patient safety
measures and using

458
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,120
hospital discharge
records from 27 states.

459
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:26,160
And in that study,
they saw that

460
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,660
black patients
experience a higher

461
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:30,500
rate of adverse
patient safety events

462
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:34,680
on 55% of patient
safety measures.

463
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:38,540
For 82% of patient
safety indicators, black

464
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,760
patients were significantly
less likely to

465
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,320
be admitted to hospitals
that were classified

466
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,820
as high quality.
And high quality was

467
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:48,360
defined as the hospitals
that were best at

468
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,540
minimizing patient
safety risk based on the

469
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:52,980
median of value of a
value of each patient

470
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:56,720
safety indicator this
same research team found

471
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,020
black patients experience
higher rates of

472
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:02,220
hospital acquired illnesses
or injuries related

473
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,240
to surgical procedures
relative to white

474
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,760
patients treated in
the very same hospital

475
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:10,120
within hospital
differences black and

476
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:13,060
white adverse patient
safety rates remain

477
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,660
when comparing black
and white patients

478
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:18,880
with similar coverage
types so this

479
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,820
study really just
showed that even within

480
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,760
the same hospital
you have different

481
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,420
populations of groups
specifically here

482
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:28,340
in racial
groups where the

483
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:30,980
health care is
not equitable

484
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,540
dr smeedly also noted
and this was adapted

485
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,440
from his presentation
that out of a

486
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,800
systematic review of
15 studies that there

487
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,020
were implicit biases
and health outcomes

488
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,980
confirmed among
healthcare professionals

489
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:50,920
um against black
latinx dark-skinned

490
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,320
individuals as the
general population

491
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,720
and that implicit
bias was significantly

492
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,080
related to patient
provider interactions

493
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:02,040
treatment decisions
treatment adherence

494
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:05,500
patient health outcomes
there was also a

495
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,960
systematic review of 37
studies that confirmed

496
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,720
substantial evidence
of pro-white or light

497
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,740
-skinned anti-black
hispanic american

498
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:15,540
indian or dark-skinned
biases among a variety

499
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:18,160
of healthcare professionals
across multiple

500
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,520
levels of training
and disciplines it

501
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:31,050
was also these these
disparities were also

502
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:34,270
noted within the
electronic health record

503
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:38,910
researchers analyzed
a sample of 40 000

504
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:40,670
history and physical
notes. And you're

505
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:42,420
going to be learning
how to take soap notes

506
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,350
in the coming months.
But I just wanted

507
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:48,230
you to be aware of
studies of soap notes

508
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:51,330
or documentations of
patient encounters.

509
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:57,730
In this sample size,
they found that 18,000

510
00:26:57,730 --> 00:27:01,170
patients approximately
had sentences containing

511
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:04,130
negative descriptors,
such as resistant,

512
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:07,070
non-compliant of
the patient or the

513
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:09,890
patient's behavior they
sought to determine the

514
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:11,870
odds of finding at
least one negative

515
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:14,510
descriptor as a function
of the patient's race

516
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:18,710
and ethnicity um
controlling force and the

517
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:20,990
control for socio
-demographic and health

518
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:25,330
characteristics um when
compared with white people

519
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:27,850
black patients had
two and a half times

520
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:30,610
the odds of having
at least one negative

521
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:33,270
descriptor in the history
and physical notes.

522
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:37,030
Their findings raise
concerns that there was

523
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,110
stigmatizing language
in the electronic

524
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:42,570
health records, and it
potentially exacerbates

525
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:44,850
racial and ethnic
health care disparities.

526
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:53,310
What is being noted
in this presentation

527
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:59,350
are studies and
publications that are

528
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:03,260
bringing light to
a reality of lived

529
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:06,010
experiences of people
who live in the United

530
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:10,850
States. You, as an
