1
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,080
Dr. Ramos here
again, great

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,680
to connect with you all.

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,580
These are the session
objectives for this

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,820
lecture taken directly
from the CPG. So

5
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:17,820
I won't spend any
time, you know, going

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,280
over this. You can
read them on your own

7
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,860
and then try to connect
what's written in

8
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:25,040
the objectives with
what I described and

9
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,560
how to connect those
dots. All right, the

10
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,460
session objectives
here are the kind of

11
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,840
the big picture, the
big picture overview

12
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,160
of the details that
we'll be presenting.

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,060
All right, hopefully
most of you have

14
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:44,400
just finished
watching the intro, my

15
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,460
earlier lecture,
which emphasizes the

16
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,760
histology and the
major cellular players

17
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,780
of the nervous system.
This is an important

18
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,480
next step of
information to

19
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,100
understanding how neurons
work in the brain.

20
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,320
we're going to be
focusing on the electrical

21
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,260
activity of neurons
and their connections.

22
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:10,300
So like many cells in
the body, neurons are

23
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,940
electrically excitable,
just like muscle

24
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,500
and just like other
parts, other organs

25
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,660
that you'll learn
about. And the reason

26
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,660
they're excitable
is obviously because

27
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:26,900
the inside and the
outside of the cells

28
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,800
contain many ions,
right? And ions have

29
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,810
electrical charge.
They can be cationic,

30
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:35,900
anionic, have one or
two charges, right?

31
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,980
And on top of that,
there are ion channels

32
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:45,780
and other transporters
and whatnot

33
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,900
that allow for dynamic
movement of ions

34
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:53,960
inside and outside,
into and out of the

35
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,700
cell, right? Which
carry their charge and

36
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,190
then are going to
change the signature

37
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:02,780
electrical potential
of the of the cell.

38
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:11,940
So the resting
membrane potential of a

39
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,940
neuron, meaning in the
absence of any kind

40
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,920
of excitation, the
resting membrane

41
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,130
potential of a neuron
is very hyperpolarized,

42
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,100
meaning more
negative relative to

43
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,680
zero and relative
to the extracellular

44
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,000
side. We're going
to cover in the next

45
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,480
couple of slides why
is the resting membrane

46
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,080
potential negative
and how does that

47
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,480
relate to neuronal
communication, right?

48
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,480
And the resting
membrane potential is

49
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,280
about minus 65 in
most CNS cells but

50
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,420
can vary quite can
vary quite a bit.

51
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:50,840
But minus 65 is a
good starting point.

52
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:56,100
And membrane potential
physiology is important

53
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:01,180
in other organ
systems. So this is

54
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:05,020
hopefully setting
the foundations of an

55
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:09,040
understanding of membrane
physiology that will

56
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,800
serve you well. For
example, when you cover

57
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,700
cardiovascular histology
and physiology.

58
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,180
All right.

59
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,380
Neuronal resting
membrane potential

60
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,560
is hyperpolarized,
about minus 65.

61
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,570
Where does that come
from? It comes to

62
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,420
be for a number of
factors. Number one,

63
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:32,760
the sodium-potassium
ATPase. Remember

64
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,180
that this pump found
on the membrane

65
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,060
of neurons is
shuttling three sodium

66
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:44,480
ions out of the cell
and pumping in two

67
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,200
potassium ions into
the cell, right?

68
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,100
And so you can see here
that three positive

69
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,680
charges are leaving,
only two are coming in.

70
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,560
So when more positive
leaves, that's

71
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,720
essentially going to make
the cell more negative.

72
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,720
It's like if you have
a bank account and

73
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,220
you spend $3 every week,
but you only take in

74
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,920
two dollars, right,
you're going to have a

75
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,560
net negative effect
on your account. So

76
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,760
that's one factor. Number
two is that there are

77
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,880
membrane channels
that are selectively

78
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:26,200
permeable to potassium
and sodium that are open

79
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,260
and leaky at rest.
These are often called

80
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,980
the leak potassium and
leak sodium channels

81
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,960
right so these channels
are always open at

82
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,300
rest and so what happens
since potassium is

83
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,140
at high concentration
inside the cell this

84
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:45,580
leaky channel is causing
potassium to leave

85
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:52,300
right and when potassium
leaves it's um it's

86
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:54,920
removing positive
charge from inside the

87
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,640
cell. There are also
leak sodium channels and

88
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,020
remember sodium is
at high concentration

89
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:03,620
outside the cell. Now
sodium is coming in in

90
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:06,340
that scenario flowing
into the cell which

91
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,400
would make it more positive
inside but it turns

92
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:14,040
out there are 40
times more leak K than

93
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,960
leak sodium channels
or the contribution of

94
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:24,920
leak potassium ions,
ion flow or leak K

95
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:28,840
channels being open is
40 times more than leak

96
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,880
sodium channels. All
right. And so recall

97
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,840
also in the background
of all this is the fact

98
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,340
that there are unequal
concentration of

99
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:42,460
ions inside and outside
the cell. And anytime

100
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:47,280
an ion is at high
concentration, it's going

101
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,160
to want to go down
its concentration

102
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,180
gradient, right? So this
is why K wants to leave

103
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:55,140
the cell, sodium wants
to enter the cell,

104
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,280
chloride wants to
enter the cell, and

105
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,380
calcium wants to
enter the cell,

106
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:05,660
right? And in this
little chart here.

107
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,420
Where is my cursor?

108
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,640
In this little
chart here, we have

109
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,480
concentrations of the
major ions at play in

110
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,520
neurons. We have
outside the cell and

111
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:24,760
inside the cell. And
notice how K is low

112
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:29,820
outside the cell, but
sodium and chloride

113
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,760
and calcium are all
high outside the

114
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,640
cell, so they want
to go into the cell.

115
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:39,000
I am aware of a
lecture that you got

116
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,760
earlier in the course
that talked about a

117
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:46,740
little bit of concentration
gradients, ion

118
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,360
flow, the Nernst
equation, right, the

119
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,320
Nernst equation, and
the Nernst equation

120
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:57,180
gives us an understanding
of where the

121
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:02,120
membrane potential
wants to rest at in the

122
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:06,790
presence of only one
ion that has unequal,

123
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:10,240
in the presence of
one, in the presence

124
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,960
of a cell that has
permeability to an ion

125
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,000
where the ion
concentrations are different

126
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,660
inside and outside
the cell. In other

127
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:21,300
words, if the cell
is permeable to K and

128
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:25,020
K is at high concentration
inside versus

129
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:28,470
outside at this ratio,
let's say 5 to 100

130
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:30,940
millimolar, then that
cell will want to

131
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:34,860
rest at about minus
80 millivolts, right?

132
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:41,340
When you combine
the differences in

133
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:44,360
concentration and
you combine the

134
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:48,000
influence of the sodium
potassium pump and

135
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,920
leak potassium
channels, leak sodium

136
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,520
channels, what we're
gonna run here.

137
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,600
All right so I'm
gonna play this

138
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:03,820
this video and in
this video we have

139
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,920
the inside the
cell, outside of the

140
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,140
cell, and we're
gonna put our players

141
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,860
here. We have our
leak channels,

142
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:13,480
sodium, and potassium.

143
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:18,100
Remember potassium is
about 40 times more

144
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:23,160
leaky than sodium and
we're putting our sodium

145
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,260
potassium ATPase.
We're changing our

146
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:30,980
concentrations. Remember
Na is low on the inside,

147
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:35,340
very high on the outside.
Potassium is high

148
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:38,940
on the inside and very
low on the outside.

149
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,120
All right, and now
these are our players

150
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:46,060
here. We're going to
simulate how a neuron

151
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,720
would respond and how
its membrane potential,

152
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,100
where it would go.
And when I hit play

153
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,660
you're going to see
where that membrane

154
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,500
potential is going to
go in this scenario.

155
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,840
Where does it go? It
goes to minus 65. And

156
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,840
what's happening is we
have our leak sodium

157
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,060
channel, leak potassium
channel, and our

158
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,440
sodium potassium ATPase.
When we play this

159
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:11,260
again, take a look at
how we have a lot more

160
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:14,400
potassium leaving
the cell than we have

161
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,320
sodium. Take a look at
our sodium potassium

162
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:21,280
ATPase pumping
out more sodium

163
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,200
than it's pumping
in potassium.

164
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,600
Okay, and you
could play this a

165
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,760
couple more times
if you need a

166
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,040
little more need
this to kind of

167
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:36,140
Visualize this
a little better.

168
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,900
So this is the kind of

169
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,580
Physiology
that's underlying

170
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:45,340
neurons at rest, right?

171
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:50,040
Well as other cell
types and other parts of

172
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,440
the body you'll learn
about resting membrane

173
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,920
potential of muscle
of cardiac cells, etc

174
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,140
all right so kind of
this is a somewhat

175
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:04,160
again a repetition but
important to make sure

176
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,800
that we we understand
where's my cursor

177
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,920
here that leak K channels
contribute quite a

178
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,400
bit to the resting
to the hyperpolarized

179
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,800
resting membrane potential
but there is some

180
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,800
contribution of the
leak sodium channels

181
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:27,020
right if K channels were
the only if K channels

182
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,140
were the only ionic
conductance right

183
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,280
well then the resting
membrane potential would

184
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,960
be at minus 80 which
is the potassium

185
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,340
equilibrium potential
but it's not right so

186
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,960
that means that there is
a contribution of leak

187
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,900
channels right to
push it a little bit

188
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:46,180
more close move it more
towards move it from

189
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,620
minus 80 to about
minus 65 all right and

190
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:52,500
that difference in
permeability or influence

191
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,760
from potassium to
sodium is about 40 to 1.

192
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,440
And like you saw in the
simulation, all these

193
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:04,960
numbers are not that
important for you

194
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,300
to memorize, but for
you to understand how

195
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:15,460
reproducible and how
well we understand these

196
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:18,360
phenomenons at least
at this at this level

197
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:24,340
okay all right so in
conclusions neurons

198
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,900
exhibit a negative
resting membrane potential

199
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:30,000
due to those factors
again sodium potassium

200
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,900
ATPase leaky channels
differences in the

201
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,140
permeability between
these leaky channels

202
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:40,780
and of course in the
background is you know

203
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:47,540
the basic principles
of you know ions at

204
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,000
different concentration
right that they want

205
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,280
to go down their
concentration gradient but

206
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:57,580
and also there is you
know an electrical

207
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:00,040
gradient right that's
that's also in the

208
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,620
background so positive
and negative charges of

209
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:12,080
course attract all
right so in contrast to

210
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:15,700
this concept that I
that we want you to get

211
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,620
you everyone to
understand is kind of the

212
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:25,180
resting membrane potential
in addition to that

213
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,140
we have to talk about
now when the neuron

214
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:32,480
is electrically active
and and that signature

215
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:39,540
activity is called
the action potential

216
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:43,220
all right so the
action potential is the

217
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:48,800
electrical and chemical
signal that neurons

218
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,960
use to initiate a
conversation with the next

219
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,940
cell that with the
postsynaptic cell all

220
00:12:55,940 --> 00:13:03,260
right it's the language
of neurons, and it is

221
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:06,340
the vehicle by which
then the chemical

222
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:09,300
messengers, the
neurotransmitters, can be

223
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:13,440
released, which then
transmit information from

224
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,020
one cell to the other,
or from one neuron to

225
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:19,280
muscle, or from one
neuron to a gland, or

226
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:23,380
from one neuron to release
a chemical messenger

227
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:27,020
into the circulation,
for example, to

228
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:30,640
then target another
organ in the periphery.

229
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,140
All right?

230
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:35,700
So we said that
neurons at rest are at

231
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:40,240
about minus 65. But if
a neuron is depolarized,

232
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:43,440
meaning depolarization,
meaning going

233
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,420
more positive or
closer to zero and past

234
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:50,140
zero, for example, If
a neuron is depolarized

235
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:53,880
to about minus 40
millivolts, so from

236
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:57,840
minus 65 to about
minus 40, then bang,

237
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,580
you'll get an action
potential, right? So the

238
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:05,240
action potential is a
very brief electrical

239
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:09,620
change in the membrane
potential of the

240
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:13,570
neuron. And we have
the classic recording

241
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,900
done here in the
squid, right? So all

242
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:21,580
living things that have
behavior have neurons

243
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,760
that exhibit action
potentials, right?

244
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:27,260
So this was in the squid
giant axon recorded

245
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:31,380
by Hodgkin and Huxley
that got them the

246
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,780
Nobel Prize. And here
we have a nice kind of

247
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:36,680
schematic of the action
potential, right?

248
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:40,620
So we can see that in
this schematic, our

249
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,820
neuron is resting right
about minus 65 here,

250
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:50,020
right? And then we have
depolarization past

251
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:54,540
zero, and then
repolarization and

252
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:59,260
hyperpolarization, and
then we get to a membrane

253
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:03,750
potential that is back
at resting levels.

254
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:07,840
And notice how this
entire event, if we say

255
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,720
maybe it's starting
right about here and

256
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,800
ending, let's say right
about here or so this

257
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,800
whole event was about
you know less than

258
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,540
three milliseconds okay
and in some neurons

259
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:24,420
it could be even
faster faster than that

260
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:30,080
okay so action potentials
we'll see in a second

261
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,220
are generated by the
activation of voltage

262
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:36,540
gated sodium and
potassium channels these

263
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:39,500
are different than
the leak, sodium, and

264
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,400
potassium channels we
talked about a couple

265
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,180
minutes ago. These are
voltage-gated, meaning

266
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:48,020
we need the voltage
to get to a certain

267
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:53,040
level, and then these
channels will open,

268
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,500
all right? And the
action potential travels

269
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:00,700
down the axon, right?
Like the axon being

270
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:05,200
a wire transmitting
this electrical signal

271
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,420
and will cause
neurotransmitter release

272
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,580
at the synapse.

273
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:17,680
So let's look at
more of the players

274
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:23,240
now in the physiology
of neurons using

275
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,540
another simulation.

276
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:30,280
Alright so here we
have our simulation

277
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:35,820
interface again and we're
going to be adding more

278
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:40,160
players to our
membrane. We're going to

279
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,340
be adding these sodium
potassium ATPase, we're

280
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:47,780
going to add our leak
potassium channel,

281
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:51,440
our leak sodium channel.
We're going to be

282
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,280
adding a voltage-gated
potassium channel and

283
00:16:56,280 --> 00:17:00,540
a voltage-gated sodium
channel, okay? All

284
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,980
right, so we're adding
our leak channels.

285
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:16,320
We said they're at
40 to 1 difference.

286
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,920
We're adding our sodium
potassium ATPase.

287
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:23,500
We're adding our
sodium channel.

288
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,240
we're adding our
voltage-gated

289
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:32,660
potassium channel.
We're going to make

290
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,880
sure our concentrations
are correct.

291
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:46,470
A is high inside the
cell and then what we

292
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:49,430
need to do is we need
to zap our neuron a

293
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:51,470
little bit, stimulate
our neuron. We're

294
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:54,230
going to stimulate
it twice to see if we

295
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:57,070
depolarize the cell with
our with our stimulation

296
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:59,890
what what happens
and here we have our

297
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:03,010
membrane voltage that
we're recording with

298
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:09,710
an oscilloscope
okay so we have our

299
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:13,330
resting membrane
potential players active

300
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:16,010
and these are quiet
we're gonna zap the

301
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:18,790
cell in a little bit
and then we'll see

302
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:22,270
what we get oh we got
an action potential.

303
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:26,050
All right, so I'm
slowing down the video.

304
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:30,930
During this
resting phase, we

305
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:32,630
have our resting
membrane potential

306
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:35,010
players up doing
their thing.

307
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:38,730
We're going to
depolarize the cell

308
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:44,670
enough to to trigger
voltage gated sodium

309
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:50,850
channels to open
here it comes here

310
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:06,210
it comes that lets
sodium in did you see

311
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:09,780
also how potassium
started to come out right

312
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:15,230
and so what what is
happening sodium ions

313
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:18,750
are rushing into the
cell through these volt

314
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:21,730
through this voltage
-gated channel and

315
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:24,390
when sodium rushes in
it's going to depolarize

316
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:27,050
the cell right and it
wants to depolarize

317
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:30,710
itself to its equilibrium
potential which

318
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:33,990
is very positive around
plus 40 right but

319
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:38,170
then this voltage
-gated potassium channel

320
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:41,670
opens because its
voltage of activation has

321
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:45,750
been met during that
depolarizing phase.

322
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:51,290
And this voltage-gated
channel opens. Well,

323
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:54,430
what happens? Potassium
is high inside the

324
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:57,390
cell. So now that this
is open, potassium can

325
00:19:57,390 --> 00:20:00,620
rush out of the cell.
When potassium rushes

326
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,570
out of the cell, what
is it doing? It's

327
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:05,590
removing positive
charges, and that's going

328
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:09,010
to bring the membrane
potential down, right?

329
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:13,810
Potassium ions want
to be at equilibrium

330
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:16,350
at about minus
80, so you can see

331
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:19,790
that little
hyperpolarized dip in the

332
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:24,070
action potential,
right? So together, this

333
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:27,510
interplay of all
of these channels,

334
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:31,950
leak, voltage gated,
in sodium potassium

335
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:37,170
ATPase are what at
play, you know, in all

336
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:45,090
neurons and underlie
how they produce

337
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:49,370
membrane potential change,
excitability changes,

338
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:52,250
and then use that
to create an action

339
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:56,020
potential to release
transmitter and send

340
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:59,250
information down the
next step, either to

341
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,590
a muscle or to a gland
or to some neural

342
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:05,610
network that's important
for emotions memory

343
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:09,550
sleep wake hunger
thirst etc right so

344
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:13,710
what's underlying
brain function are the

345
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:16,110
neurons and there are
different parts of the

346
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:19,770
neuron and then the
different ion channels

347
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:22,710
and and you'll see
receptors and all

348
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:26,970
that that you know all
right all right play

349
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:35,870
okay so we talked
about I didn't have a

350
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:40,070
chance to pause it at
the right at the right

351
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:43,990
spot but I want you
to notice that our

352
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:46,850
voltage gated sodium
channel was slightly

353
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:49,850
different than our
voltage gated potassium

354
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:54,250
channel in that it has
this one little kind

355
00:21:54,250 --> 00:22:00,550
of gate here all right
this gate is known

356
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:03,630
as the inactivation
gate it's part of the

357
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:08,610
protein that produces
an interesting phenomena

358
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:12,910
about how this this
channel can work

359
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:17,410
so essentially there
are two kinds of

360
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:22,230
compartments to the to
the channel to the pore

361
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:25,590
that are going to
regulate whether ions can

362
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:28,100
flow through it and
in this case sodium.

363
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:32,030
So in this
configuration where the

364
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:36,350
inactivation gate
is open and the

365
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:40,950
channel pore itself
is closed this is

366
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:44,290
known as the closed
state and ions

367
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:47,970
cannot flow through
this state. Okay,

368
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:50,490
ions can only flow
or this channel

369
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:54,270
is open when both
the inactivation

370
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:57,550
gate and this pore
gate are open.

371
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:00,790
Then ion can flow
through it. We call that

372
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:02,930
the open state. So
there's a closed state,

373
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:05,750
the open state, and
notice that there's also

374
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:09,630
an inactivated state.
In the inactivated state

375
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:14,610
this inactivation
gate is closed and

376
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:21,390
basically that shuts down
the channel pore. And

377
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:23,950
no matter what happens
here, it doesn't matter

378
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:27,770
if this moves open or
not, this is in the

379
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:30,750
closed state, this
channel is inactivated.

380
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:35,790
And voltage gated
sodium channels move

381
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,930
into these different
phases depending

382
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:42,550
on the membrane
potential, right? So

383
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:45,910
at rest, voltage
gated sodium channels

384
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:48,850
are are generally
in the closed state.

385
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:51,950
Anything that
will raise the

386
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:53,750
membrane potential
to threshold

387
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:57,650
will allow the
channel to open,

388
00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:01,790
right? Ions will flow
through, but soon after

389
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:05,870
the channel opens
and upon further

390
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:09,970
depolarization, the
inactivation gate will shut and

391
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:13,190
then this channel can
no longer flux ion.

392
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:18,890
And only after the
membrane potential is

393
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:21,830
repolarized again to
a hyperpolarized state

394
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:26,170
will this inactivation
gate be open. So that's

395
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:27,950
exactly what happens
during the action

396
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:31,160
potential, right? We have
all these phases where

397
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:34,890
some stimulus will
depolarize the cell

398
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:37,930
enough for it to trigger
an action potential

399
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:42,150
where these channels
go from closed to open.

400
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:46,390
And sodium ions that
rush in flow through

401
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:51,030
and depolarize the cell.
But as the membrane

402
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:53,590
potential is getting more
and more depolarized,

403
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:56,410
the inactivation
gates kick in, right,

404
00:24:56,550 --> 00:25:00,570
and sodium ions stop
flowing through the

405
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:04,550
channel here. At the
same time, we saw that

406
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:07,570
our voltage-gated
potassium channels open.

407
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:11,150
Potassium leaves the
cell, causing the

408
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:14,870
membrane potential to
repolarize, right, and

409
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:17,310
then even go more
negative than the initial

410
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:21,510
state because K is
rushing out of the cell.

411
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:24,450
And so in this way,

412
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:28,710
sodium channel
inactivation and the

413
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:30,430
inactivation of
other channels are

414
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:33,290
really important
in the physiology.

415
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:38,400
So in summary, voltage
-gated sodium channel

416
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,630
inactivation is
produced by a separate

417
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:43,450
part of the protein
known as the inactivation

418
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:47,110
gate, and we mentioned
all this stuff.

419
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:49,670
Why? Because there
are genetic mutations

420
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:53,650
that affect the
inactivation gate, which

421
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:55,830
can result in the
channels being open for

422
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:58,730
too long. If the
channels are open for too

423
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:03,160
long, then you have
abnormal excitation,

424
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:08,850
too much ion flux,
and genetic mutations

425
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:11,690
affecting the inactivation
gate of sodium

426
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:15,490
channels produces
brain hyperexcitability

427
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:18,890
and epilepsy. On top
of that, you'll learn

428
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:22,790
that there are drugs
that modify channel

429
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:26,190
inactivation that can
be exploited to speed

430
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:28,370
up or slow down
inactivation depending on

431
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:30,410
the disease. And
obviously for something

432
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:37,090
like epilepsy, you
would want drugs that

433
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:41,050
increase sodium channel
activation, right?

434
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:48,150
Okay, so in summary,
there are four

435
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:50,270
basic components to
the action potential.

436
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:52,810
We have the rising
phase of initial

437
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:54,770
rapid depolarization
caused by the

438
00:26:54,770 --> 00:27:00,090
opening of voltage
-gated sodium

439
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:02,270
channels, right?
That's this part here.

440
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:06,850
The overshoot
portion is when the

441
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:09,270
membrane potential
is depolarized

442
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:12,110
past zero. You
can see that here.

443
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:15,870
And this is due to
the opening, closing,

444
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:18,470
and inactivation of
sodium channels, right?

445
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,770
And in particular
more and more

446
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:23,610
inactivation is now
taking place over

447
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:27,550
here, as well as the
opening of voltage

448
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:29,910
-gated potassium
channels, right?

449
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:35,070
The falling phase
over here is due to

450
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,390
the rapid
hyperpolarization of the

451
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:39,590
membrane potential
due to more and more

452
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:42,030
opening of voltage
-gated K channels.

453
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:48,290
And then the
undershoot, right here,

454
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:52,270
portion that is more
hyperpolarized than

455
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:55,470
what the cell was at
rest is due to all this

456
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:58,430
potassium exiting the
cell and the membrane

457
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:00,830
potential trying to
go to the equilibrium

458
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:03,790
potential of potassium
which is at about minus

459
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:09,030
80 okay so it's it's
a lot I would suggest

460
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:11,510
kind of going over
over this watching

461
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:14,850
different parts of this
of these slides again

462
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:19,090
if necessary and
remember that all of this

463
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:23,190
Getting kind of this
physiology down and

464
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:26,770
having this picture in
your mind of ion channels

465
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:29,410
and the membrane
potential moving up or

466
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:32,110
down is going to be
really important also

467
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:36,730
in cardio when you're
learning about atrial

468
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:40,850
cells or ventricular
cells that each have

469
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:45,370
their own interesting
membrane potential

470
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:49,790
physiology that underlies
how they rhythmically

471
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:52,830
beat and contract,
right? Not to, and how

472
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:55,330
they produce kind of
their action potentials,

473
00:28:55,330 --> 00:29:00,010
not for communication
like neurons do,

474
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:02,500
but instead in the
heart for synchronizing,

475
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:06,910
you know, the contraction
of the tissue to

476
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:10,870
pump blood out, right?
But, you know, it

477
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:14,050
all boils down to
understanding the cells,

478
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:17,790
the ion channels
transporters etc and how they

479
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:22,150
work in combination
and sequentially etc

480
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:27,390
whatever the case case
may be all right now

481
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:30,250
some clinical correlates
obviously anything

482
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:34,030
that interferes with
the function of any

483
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:36,310
kind of channel is going
to alter the physiology

484
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:39,630
and function of that
of that cell that's

485
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:41,470
in a particular
tissue and organ right

486
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:43,090
and you're going to
see some manifestation.

487
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:50,250
So in nature,
there are these ion

488
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:53,350
channel blockers
that are found

489
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:55,710
in toxins in
different organisms.

490
00:29:55,830 --> 00:30:00,470
So there is a
bacteria in some fish,

491
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:02,830
especially in
puffer fish, right,

492
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:07,530
that is a potent
sodium channel

493
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:11,450
blocker. That toxin
is known as TTX,

494
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:14,170
titrototoxin. It's
found in fish.

495
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:17,510
And so eating
small amounts of

496
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:20,910
this fish, which
is very dangerous,

497
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:28,630
is going to alter
the physiology of the

498
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:30,910
sensory cells in
the mouth. Small

499
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:33,030
amounts are going
to cause tingling or

500
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:37,010
numbness as these cells
and their physiology

501
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:39,490
is being altered
because they can't

502
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:43,270
generate action
potentials normally.

503
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,190
Eating large amounts
of these fish are going

504
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:54,190
to cause more widespread
changes centrally

505
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:57,250
and peripherally. So
like limb weakness,

506
00:30:57,270 --> 00:31:00,050
respiratory failure,
and cardiac arrest.

507
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:03,010
There are sodium
channels in the heart as

508
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:06,450
well, like I mentioned.
And so there are

509
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:09,330
also neurons in the
central nervous system

510
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:12,410
that help regulate
cardiac function, right?

511
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:16,090
Virtually all neurons
have sodium channels.

512
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:22,970
So high levels of TTX
in a person that's

513
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:26,330
eaten a lot of this
fish could ultimately

514
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:30,670
cause death, right?
and the mechanism by

515
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:34,690
that is blocking the
sodium channels. There

516
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:39,870
is another toxin
found in microbes that

517
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:44,640
then live in shellfish
called saxotoxin.

518
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:49,330
And saxotoxin
is also a potent

519
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:50,950
sodium channel
blocker and is going

520
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,530
to produce therefore
similar symptoms

521
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:55,750
like you see in
TTX poisoning.

522
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:02,390
and finally i mean
there's a plenty of list

523
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:06,830
of of channel blockers
that exist in nature

524
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:09,210
i'm just showing you
know a small number

525
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:11,990
here and focusing on
those channels that we

526
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:13,990
talked about in the
generation of action

527
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:16,070
potentials like voltage
-gated sodium and voltage

528
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:18,330
-gated potassium channels
the last one i'll

529
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:23,890
mention for now is
the um is dendrotoxin

530
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:29,570
dendrotoxin,
which is a potent

531
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:31,850
potassium channel
blocker found in

532
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:34,280
the venom of the
green mamba snake.

533
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:39,590
And because it's
blocking K channels,

534
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,490
right, not sodium
channels, it's blocking

535
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:43,370
K channels, which
are important for the

536
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:45,190
repolarization,
right, so what's going

537
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:49,070
to happen is it's
going to disrupt the

538
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:51,550
natural cycle of the
action potential of

539
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:53,570
the depolarization,
repolarization

540
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:56,730
phasing phases and so
it's going to prolong

541
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:59,170
action potentials
it's going to affect

542
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:04,310
all kinds of neural
function and when it

543
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:06,470
affects the cardiovascular
system of course then

544
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:11,860
you can have you know
ultimately death due

545
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:15,540
to these due to this
disruption again

546
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:21,210
relating kind of clinic
Clinical medicine, clinical

547
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:25,690
approaches to basic
biology is the

548
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:29,150
mechanism of action of
lidocaine, right? So

549
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:34,190
lidocaine is a great
sodium channel blocker that

550
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:36,950
is used in a lot
of local anesthetic

551
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:41,050
applications, right? In
dentistry and in, you know,

552
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:43,390
peripheral cuts, all
kinds of different

553
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:46,250
formulations are out
there, including creams,

554
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:49,890
right? Pain-relieving
cream with lidocaine,

555
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:55,470
4% lidocaine, and
patches that you could

556
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:59,430
put on the skin for
back pain or any number

557
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:05,510
of symptoms that you
might have. right? And

558
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:13,110
so here is the
schematic of the voltage

559
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:19,670
-gated sodium channel
protein here, and what we

560
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:22,530
can see there's a
portion of the channel

561
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:27,510
that has binding sites
for lidocaine, and

562
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:29,910
essentially what
lidocaine does then it's

563
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:34,190
going to block the
channel pore from fluxing

564
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:37,530
sodium, and then this
is going to shut down

565
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:42,750
action potentials. If
those action potentials

566
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:45,410
are from cells in
the periphery, for

567
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:48,250
example, that are
sending pain signals

568
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:50,910
to the central nervous
system, then by

569
00:34:50,910 --> 00:34:52,830
shutting down those
action potentials, you

570
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:57,390
can relieve pain, right?
So here is a great

571
00:34:57,390 --> 00:35:00,480
application of our
biomedical sciences

572
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,230
understanding about
neurons and their

573
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:10,610
physiology towards a
treatment for treating

574
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:13,690
localized pain,
all right?

575
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:18,290
A couple of years ago,
there was some good

576
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:20,550
clinical trial data
that came out for

577
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:23,670
a new voltage-gated
sodium channel blocker

578
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:26,350
that can be used for
post-surgical pain

579
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:28,370
in the New England
Journal of Medicine.

580
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:31,030
I believe it was used
for patients after

581
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:33,630
abdominal surgery and
bunion surgery and

582
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:36,530
note that both of
those procedures are

583
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:39,090
associated with intense
post-surgical pain.

584
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:42,490
What's neat about this
kind of pharmacological

585
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:47,470
approach is that it
targets the NAV 1.8

586
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:50,150
voltage-gated sodium
channel, which is

587
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:52,650
specifically expressed
in dorsal root ganglion

588
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:55,430
neurons and not in
central nervous system

589
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:58,190
neurons. Remember that
these DRG cells are

590
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:00,370
the ones that send
pain signals from the

591
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:03,430
periphery up to the
central nervous system.

592
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:05,610
And it's not a good
idea to give sodium

593
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:08,610
channel blockers in
the brain because that

594
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:11,010
could lead to sensory
and motor deficits.

595
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:13,530
But if there's a
unique channel in the

596
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:16,010
periphery that can be
targeted for specific

597
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:19,330
pain pathways up to the
brain, well then that

598
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:21,790
kind of drug is perfect
for pain relief.

599
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:25,110
And in the context
of a lot of opiate

600
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:27,830
use and *****,
finding new drugs for

601
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:29,650
the treatment of pain
is really important.

602
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:33,010
Well this drug
received FDA approval

603
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:36,830
this year and is
called Jornavax.

604
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:41,250
And here's a little
cartoon from the

605
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:44,910
Dronevax web page
that kind of has

606
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:47,950
some patient
education and you

607
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:51,030
can see they show
here pain signals

608
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:54,190
are created by
injury or surgery.

609
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:56,530
Dronevax works
in the peripheral

610
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:59,330
nervous system
what to block pain

611
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:02,350
signals before they
reach the brain.

612
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:06,270
So this is another great
example of applying

613
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:09,950
our biomedical
sciences knowledge in

614
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:13,170
the development of new
medicines for pain.

615
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:19,890
We can talk about
voltage-gated sodium

616
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:21,930
channels for the
whole year, but I'll

617
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:24,370
leave you with this
last slide, which

618
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:26,710
describes voltage
-gated sodium channel

619
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:30,050
gene mutations affecting
peripheral nervous

620
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:31,870
system neurons
that cause pain

621
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:36,050
syndromes. Now, depending
on the mutation,

622
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:38,770
some mutations
cause the channel

623
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:41,550
function to have
increased activity.

624
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:43,250
So in this case,

625
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:46,550
increased activity of
voltage-gated sodium

626
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:48,350
channels is going
to cause too many

627
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:50,550
action potentials,
right, and therefore

628
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:54,070
abnormal pain signals
sent to the CNS.

629
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:57,590
And there are two
conditions of note. One

630
00:37:57,590 --> 00:38:01,890
is called inherited
primary erythromyalgia

631
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:04,390
and this is caused
by an activating

632
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:09,090
mutation of the NAV
1.8 voltage gated

633
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:11,790
sodium channel which
we just talked about.

634
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,050
And this is a rare
syndrome of intermittent

635
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:18,470
red hot painful
extremities usually

636
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:20,490
affecting the lower
extremities. And there's a

637
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:25,070
picture right here of
those red extremities

638
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:27,360
you might see in this
affected patient.

639
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:34,670
Another mutation affecting
the NAV 1.7 channel

640
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:38,170
in DRG neurons is
called familial episodic

641
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:40,110
pain syndrome.
Somewhat similar to the

642
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:42,270
one we just discussed,
but a little bit

643
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:46,770
different in its
presentation but again these

644
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:50,870
mutations cause increased
abnormal activity

645
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:56,470
which is then translates
into increased pain

646
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:59,930
symptoms right now
let's contrast that

647
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:02,310
with mutations that
affect channel function

648
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:06,350
by reducing channel
activity this is going

649
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:09,310
to produce too few
action potentials and

650
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:14,010
reduced pain signals
sent to the CNS. And a

651
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:17,430
different flavor of
mutations affecting the

652
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:21,630
NAV 1.7 causes a syndrome
called congenital

653
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:25,910
pain insensitivity,
congenital pain insensitivity,

654
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:27,870
also known as
congenital analgesia.

655
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:33,390
And in this condition,
you see near complete

656
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:36,350
absence of pain
perception associated with

657
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:39,330
noxious stimuli. These
patients have pain,

658
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:42,750
therefore end up with
painless injuries,

659
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:44,990
right? They have injuries
that they don't perceive

660
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:47,470
beginning in infancy,
but they have

661
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:50,550
otherwise normal sensory
modalities. So I hope

662
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:55,850
discussing how sodium
channels play a role

663
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:58,730
in the action potential,
how pharmacological

664
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:02,830
treatments target
voltage-gated

665
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:04,710
sodium channels and
how gene mutations

666
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:07,390
affect pain
perception kind of

667
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:10,010
hopefully brings
it all together.

668
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:15,230
So in conclusion
to this part of the

669
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:17,530
presentation, the
neuronal membrane contains

670
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:19,930
voltage-gated sodium and
potassium channels that

671
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:22,650
contribute to action
potential generation.

672
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:25,190
Action potentials
have different and

673
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:27,570
distinct phases, which
are produced by sequential

674
00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:29,630
opening and closing
of voltage-gated

675
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:32,550
sodium and potassium
channels. Action potentials

676
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:35,350
can be modified by
ion channel blockers

677
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:39,070
such as TTX, lidocaine,
and we saw adronovax.

678
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:41,390
And gene mutations
affecting voltage

679
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:44,590
-gated sodium channels
produce pain syndromes.

680
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:48,750
All right, so now we
want to put together

681
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:51,990
what we understand.
All right, so

682
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:55,930
let's look at the
example now when the

683
00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:58,530
presynaptic neuron
releases glutamate

684
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:04,250
as its neurotransmitter.

685
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:07,610
All right, so we have
the action potential

686
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:10,560
from the presynaptic
neuron depolarizing

687
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,710
the terminal voltage
-gated calcium

688
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:17,150
channels, vesicular
exocytosis of glutamate

689
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:18,890
in this case. So
glutamate, here is

690
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:22,830
our green dots into
the synaptic cleft,

691
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:25,930
right? And when
glutamate binds to

692
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:28,430
its glutamate
receptor, in this case

693
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:34,850
the AMPA, A-M-P
-A, AMPA receptor,

694
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:40,830
it opens a pore, and
that pore is permeable

695
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:43,460
to sodium and
potassium. But because

696
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:47,430
the driving force
for sodium is so

697
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:51,910
high, the sodium
rushes into the cell,

698
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:56,070
depolarizing more than
K leaving the cell.

699
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:58,850
And that depolarization
is going to be

700
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:03,370
visible as a membrane
potential change in the

701
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:05,070
postsynaptic neuron.
And you can see that

702
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:08,190
as a little blip of
excitation, a little blip

703
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:10,850
of depolarization
closer to zero, right?

704
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:16,710
if this is zero but note
that that depolarization

705
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:19,330
is pretty small
that could be about

706
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:23,260
you know two or three
millivolts three millivolts

707
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:28,350
right so from minus
65 to about minus

708
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:31,690
62 for example and
what that means is that

709
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:34,830
one individual cell might
not excite the neuron

710
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:37,510
enough to get it to
Let's say minus 40

711
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:40,070
and then trigger an
action potential in the

712
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:42,330
postsynaptic cell.
Instead, this is where the,

713
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:46,730
what nature created is
these large dendritic

714
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:51,790
trees, the complex
dendrites, so that lots

715
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:54,570
of neurons can be
talking to each other,

716
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:57,390
lots of inputs,
synaptic inputs onto the

717
00:42:57,390 --> 00:42:59,830
dendrites of a neuron.
And if a lot of those

718
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:03,000
are active at once,
then all of these EPSPs,

719
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:07,170
excitatory postsynaptic
potentials, EPSPs,

720
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:10,250
will be bigger and
bigger and bigger. They

721
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:13,450
will summate, and that
neuron will get to minus

722
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:16,350
40 and trigger its
own action potential,

723
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:18,810
and that action potential
will travel down

724
00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:22,650
that neuron's axon
and then connect to a

725
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:25,930
muscle, for example, right?
So the action potential

726
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:28,570
induced release of
glutamate into the

727
00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:36,910
cleft will result in
sodium rushing into the

728
00:43:38,770 --> 00:43:41,870
postsynaptic cell,
depolarizing the neuron,

729
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:45,070
and which then might
also contribute to

730
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:47,590
action potential
generation. And here we have

731
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:49,710
an example where there
were recordings in

732
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:52,530
the presynaptic
cells, cell 1, and the

733
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:54,730
postsynaptic cells, cell
2. And you can see every

734
00:43:54,730 --> 00:43:57,550
time the neuron fires
an action potential,

735
00:43:57,550 --> 00:44:00,830
we see a postsynaptic
response because

736
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:03,790
these cells are connected,
right? The response

737
00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:05,430
could be small, so
this is only going to

738
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:11,490
be one or two millivolts,
but at least there's

739
00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:13,630
this reliable
communication, all right?

740
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:17,950
And if we look at
the timing of this

741
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:22,070
communication, most
of the responses
that you record

742
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:24,830
in the postsynaptic
cell happen at about

743
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:29,950
one latent one millisecond
latency and here

744
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:36,810
we have some um little
video of some epsps

745
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:39,270
excitatory postsynaptic
potentials recorded

746
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:40,930
in a neuron this
neuron you could see is

747
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:44,390
about at minus 75 resting
membrane potential

748
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:46,910
so each one of these
little blips that you

749
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:49,290
see some are bigger
some are a little

750
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:53,930
smaller. All of these are
examples of transmitter

751
00:44:53,930 --> 00:44:57,890
being released
presynaptically and binding

752
00:44:57,890 --> 00:45:00,490
to this cell that was
being recorded and

753
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:03,210
then ion flow into the
cell. In this case,

754
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:04,130
you know,

755
00:45:05,490 --> 00:45:07,830
likely mostly
sodium because

756
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:09,790
this is depolarizing
the cell.

757
00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:16,570
Let's contrast what
we covered for the

758
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:19,950
glutamate synapses
with our gap with a

759
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:22,450
GABA synapse that
will hyperpolarize

760
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:25,450
postsynaptic neurons
all right how does this

761
00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:30,630
come about instead of
release of glutamate

762
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:33,510
we have release of
GABA after an action

763
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:35,030
potential and
voltage-gated calcium

764
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:39,590
channel opening and
GABA will bind to its

765
00:45:39,590 --> 00:45:43,250
postsynaptic receptor
right let's say on

766
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:45,150
the dendrite of the
postsynaptic neuron

767
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:50,310
And that receptor opens
a pore permeable to

768
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:55,250
chloride. Chloride has
a negative charge to

769
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:58,590
it. And so when
chloride rushes into the

770
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:01,310
cell, it's hyperpolarizing
the cell, making

771
00:46:01,310 --> 00:46:03,670
it more negative, right?
So the response that

772
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:07,970
you'll see is more
negative here. And that's

773
00:46:07,970 --> 00:46:11,010
called the inhibitory
postsynaptic potential.

774
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:14,030
So if our cell was
hanging out at about

775
00:46:14,030 --> 00:46:18,350
minus 62, let's say,
when the presynaptic

776
00:46:18,350 --> 00:46:20,130
neuron fires an action
potential, releases

777
00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:23,510
GABA, it's going to
hyperpolarize the cell.

778
00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:28,330
And that makes the
postsynaptic cell less

779
00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:30,370
likely to fire an
action potential, right?

780
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:35,670
because it is moving
further away from let's

781
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:39,150
say minus 40 where it
would need to hit to

782
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:42,790
to trigger an
action potential. So

783
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:45,770
the action potential
in the presynaptic

784
00:46:45,850 --> 00:46:48,050
neuron induces
release of GABA.

785
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:51,510
Ionotropic GABA
receptors have a chloride

786
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:54,430
pore. Chloride rushes
into the cell due to the

787
00:46:54,430 --> 00:46:56,490
concentration gradient
making it harder for

788
00:46:56,490 --> 00:46:58,090
the postsynaptic
neuron to fire action

789
00:46:58,090 --> 00:47:01,150
potentials. And here in
this example where we

790
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:03,770
where the pre-synaptic
neuron and the post

791
00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:05,910
-synaptic neuron were
recorded together, you can

792
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:08,450
see for every action
potential that you can

793
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:11,590
that you have, you
have a little blip of

794
00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:14,910
hyperpolarization in
the post-synaptic cell.

795
00:47:19,810 --> 00:47:22,070
All right, we're
going to contrast real

796
00:47:22,070 --> 00:47:24,930
quick here the
chemical synapses with

797
00:47:24,930 --> 00:47:28,690
electrical synapses. So
we talked about those

798
00:47:28,690 --> 00:47:31,230
briefly in the earlier
lecture. This is

799
00:47:31,230 --> 00:47:33,830
not neurotransmitter
based, right, and

800
00:47:33,830 --> 00:47:36,150
it's not even action
potential dependent.

801
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:41,750
This kind of synapse
can, you know, can

802
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:44,670
be is active all the
time in the sense

803
00:47:44,670 --> 00:47:47,430
that there are these
pores, right, that

804
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:49,940
are linking. So
here's our electrical

805
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:52,090
synapse. We're going
to zoom in on it. We

806
00:47:52,090 --> 00:47:53,770
have these channels,
these connection

807
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:59,070
channels, that are
pores that allow ion and

808
00:47:59,070 --> 00:48:01,630
small molecule flow
between the cells.

809
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:04,670
So these are
going to be active

810
00:48:04,670 --> 00:48:06,750
all the time.
And if we were

811
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:09,250
to inject a dye
into this cell,

812
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:11,810
that dye would
go through the

813
00:48:11,810 --> 00:48:14,290
gap junction to
the other cell.

814
00:48:15,710 --> 00:48:19,750
Many different kinds
of changes in one

815
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:21,830
neuron would be
reflected in the other

816
00:48:21,830 --> 00:48:25,810
neuron. all right now
it is the case that

817
00:48:25,810 --> 00:48:27,970
even though these
guys have electrical

818
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:32,410
synapses there's still an

819
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:34,090
influence of the
action potential

820
00:48:34,090 --> 00:48:36,590
in one cell
versus the other

821
00:48:38,270 --> 00:48:41,330
so there is an influence
still of the action

822
00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:45,990
potential at at gap
junctions in that

823
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:49,370
when when one neuron
fires an action potential

824
00:48:49,370 --> 00:48:51,630
right and remember
sodium and potassium

825
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:54,710
are running into and
out of the cell during

826
00:48:54,710 --> 00:48:57,330
the action potential,
you will see a

827
00:48:57,330 --> 00:49:00,030
membrane potential
change in the other

828
00:49:00,030 --> 00:49:02,750
postsynaptic neuron
connected by gap junctions.

829
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:05,280
Now, this is not
mediated by transmitter,

830
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:09,790
right? This is just
direct ion flow of, let's

831
00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:13,730
say, sodium rushing
from one cell into the

832
00:49:13,730 --> 00:49:15,650
other, right? So that's
where it's different

833
00:49:15,650 --> 00:49:18,230
than the chemical
synapses. And so for

834
00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:21,650
each action potential in
the presynaptic neuron,

835
00:49:21,650 --> 00:49:25,450
you'll see a little
blip in the postsynaptic

836
00:49:25,450 --> 00:49:28,130
cell. And of course,
this is depolarizing

837
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:30,650
the cell, and this
could contribute to

838
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:35,250
action potential generation
in that postsynaptic

839
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:37,090
neuron, right? And
again, the name of the

840
00:49:37,090 --> 00:49:40,570
game is how are neurons
communicating with

841
00:49:40,570 --> 00:49:43,030
each other to produce
behavior, to produce

842
00:49:43,030 --> 00:49:45,510
movement, to produce
emotion, etc. These are

843
00:49:45,510 --> 00:49:47,830
all the different
ways that neurons are

844
00:49:47,830 --> 00:49:51,150
connected and how they
can communicate, right?

845
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:55,770
All right, and
this kind of

846
00:49:55,770 --> 00:49:57,950
communication is
very, very fast.

847
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:02,590
All right, let's kind
of put it all together

848
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:06,310
in a neat example of
where we have the nerve,

849
00:50:06,310 --> 00:50:08,270
we have neurons, we
have synapses, we have

850
00:50:08,270 --> 00:50:10,570
axons, dendrites, etc.
We're going to put

851
00:50:10,570 --> 00:50:13,030
it all together in the
patellar tendon reflex,

852
00:50:13,030 --> 00:50:15,790
which is an amazing
example of how neuronal

853
00:50:15,790 --> 00:50:18,550
connections and synaptic
physiology creates

854
00:50:18,550 --> 00:50:20,090
behavior. In this
case, we have the

855
00:50:20,090 --> 00:50:23,330
sensation, and we have
the movement response,

856
00:50:23,330 --> 00:50:26,050
right? So, everybody
knows the doctor hits the

857
00:50:26,450 --> 00:50:30,330
patella. It lengthens
the muscle. Here, in

858
00:50:30,330 --> 00:50:33,150
this case, the quad.
Inside the muscle,

859
00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:37,430
there are muscle
spindles, which are axons

860
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:44,130
that wrap around the
muscle fiber, right?

861
00:50:44,130 --> 00:50:47,670
And if we zoom in on
this little patch of

862
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:53,350
the axon, right, the
sensory neuron axon,

863
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:55,450
we'll see how it wraps
around the muscle

864
00:50:55,450 --> 00:50:58,190
fiber. If we zoom in
on that even further,

865
00:50:58,190 --> 00:51:00,590
we'll see that there
are channels, right?

866
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:02,070
This is how we have
to think about the

867
00:51:02,070 --> 00:51:03,490
brain. We always have
to think about the

868
00:51:03,490 --> 00:51:06,990
neurons, their membranes,
the channels, etc.

869
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:10,610
And these channels
are mechanically

870
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:14,470
gated, right? So as
the muscle stretches,

871
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:17,770
the axon membrane
is stretching.

872
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:22,010
These channels
are mechanically

873
00:51:22,010 --> 00:51:23,570
activated. They
are going to

874
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:27,750
open and allow
sodium to rush in.

875
00:51:28,310 --> 00:51:33,190
Sodium rushes into
the sensory neuron.

876
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:37,330
Sodium is going
to depolarize the

877
00:51:37,330 --> 00:51:40,730
cell. If it depolarizes
the cell enough,

878
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:44,150
it is going to
open voltage-gated

879
00:51:44,150 --> 00:51:46,310
sodium channels that
are also on here.

880
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:51,470
If they open voltage
-gated sodium channels,

881
00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:52,730
it's going to
cause an action

882
00:51:52,730 --> 00:51:55,310
potential. So now this
neuron generates an

883
00:51:55,310 --> 00:51:59,010
action potential,
right? And that signal

884
00:51:59,510 --> 00:52:04,270
is going to travel
down the axon. Here's

885
00:52:04,270 --> 00:52:08,590
the DRG, dorsal
ruganglion. That action

886
00:52:08,590 --> 00:52:10,750
potential is going to
travel to the terminal,

887
00:52:10,950 --> 00:52:14,810
right? And this
sensory neuron, this 1A

888
00:52:14,810 --> 00:52:18,450
afferent, right, encoding
muscle length here

889
00:52:18,450 --> 00:52:21,750
at the muscle spindle
is going to do what?

890
00:52:21,750 --> 00:52:24,680
It's going to synapse
on the dendrites

891
00:52:24,970 --> 00:52:28,450
of a alpha motor neuron,
right? So we have

892
00:52:28,450 --> 00:52:31,250
axon, terminal, synapse
at the dendrite.

893
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:36,510
The 1A afferent neuron
releases glutamate.

894
00:52:36,690 --> 00:52:39,570
What does glutamate
do? It's going to want

895
00:52:39,570 --> 00:52:44,790
to depolarize the alpha
motor neuron as if

896
00:52:44,790 --> 00:52:48,010
it depolarizes it enough
we're going to get

897
00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:51,830
voltage gated sodium
channels that open on

898
00:52:51,830 --> 00:52:55,090
the alpha motor neuron
and that action potential

899
00:52:55,090 --> 00:52:59,650
is going to travel
to the muscle to the

900
00:52:59,650 --> 00:53:02,850
uh to the synapse from
the motor neuron to

901
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:06,470
the muscle right and
that synapse is a very

902
00:53:06,470 --> 00:53:08,330
special synapse you'll
learn a lot about.

903
00:53:08,770 --> 00:53:11,470
The alpha motor
neuron releases

904
00:53:11,470 --> 00:53:14,330
acetylcholine at
the muscle and

905
00:53:14,330 --> 00:53:17,080
acetylcholine can then
trigger excitation

906
00:53:17,170 --> 00:53:19,710
of the muscle.
Let's go over that.

907
00:53:21,270 --> 00:53:24,270
First let's look at
you know the the alpha

908
00:53:24,270 --> 00:53:27,250
motor neuron synapses
on the muscle fiber.

909
00:53:27,250 --> 00:53:32,530
It's a very highly
specialized synapse that

910
00:53:32,530 --> 00:53:35,330
kind of looks here's
that that here's the

911
00:53:35,330 --> 00:53:38,210
synaptic cleft very
very interesting

912
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,680
invaginations here we have
our little transmitter

913
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:46,910
vesicles right so let's
put it all together

914
00:53:48,790 --> 00:53:51,790
all right so let's
keep putting this all

915
00:53:51,790 --> 00:53:53,870
together and including
all the different

916
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:55,770
concepts that
we've covered so

917
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:58,730
far. We have our
sensory neuron

918
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:02,550
that projects to
our motor neuron

919
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:05,150
and an action
potential in the

920
00:54:05,150 --> 00:54:07,190
sensory neuron is
going to release

921
00:54:07,190 --> 00:54:10,050
glutamate at this
synapse here,

922
00:54:10,210 --> 00:54:10,970
right?

923
00:54:11,310 --> 00:54:15,500
If it depolarizes the
motor neuron enough,

924
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:18,290
this motor neuron will
fire an action potential

925
00:54:18,290 --> 00:54:21,370
as well. That action
potential will travel

926
00:54:21,370 --> 00:54:25,530
down the myelinated
axon until it reaches

927
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:31,770
the axon terminal, the
special synapse that

928
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:34,790
we know of as the
neuromuscular junction.

929
00:54:34,990 --> 00:54:39,150
The action potential
depolarizes the terminal

930
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:43,150
and voltage-gated
calcium channels open,

931
00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:45,790
depolarize the terminal,
And then we can

932
00:54:45,790 --> 00:54:48,350
see here, as we zoom
in further and further

933
00:54:48,350 --> 00:54:50,450
at this special
synapse, we have

934
00:54:50,450 --> 00:54:54,710
transmitter, and we see
the postsynaptic muscle

935
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:59,290
elements here. Let's
zoom in even further,

936
00:54:59,830 --> 00:55:05,070
right? Depolarization
of the axon terminal

937
00:55:05,070 --> 00:55:09,790
is going to cause
vesicles to be exocytosed

938
00:55:09,790 --> 00:55:15,670
at the presynaptic terminal,
right? Acetylcholine

939
00:55:15,670 --> 00:55:17,470
is released at this
synapse right at

940
00:55:17,470 --> 00:55:23,050
the neuromuscular
junction and acetylcholine

941
00:55:23,050 --> 00:55:27,050
will bind to the
acetylcholine receptor in

942
00:55:27,050 --> 00:55:30,680
this case that's the
nicotinic receptor right

943
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:35,210
and this receptor
allows sodium to rush

944
00:55:35,210 --> 00:55:38,330
in and potassium rushes
out but more sodium

945
00:55:38,330 --> 00:55:41,210
rushes in than potassium
leaving, so you have

946
00:55:41,210 --> 00:55:45,450
a net depolarization
of the muscle fiber.

947
00:55:48,130 --> 00:55:50,530
Depolarization
of the end plate

948
00:55:50,530 --> 00:55:54,230
is going to cause
voltage-gated

949
00:55:54,230 --> 00:55:56,350
sodium channels
in the muscle

950
00:55:57,150 --> 00:55:59,870
to depolarize
and that then

951
00:55:59,870 --> 00:56:02,350
produces the
action potential.

952
00:56:02,690 --> 00:56:06,650
So I hope you can see
how we can integrate

953
00:56:06,770 --> 00:56:10,190
all the different concepts
that we've discussed

954
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:14,510
on top of the neural
circuitry to understand

955
00:56:14,510 --> 00:56:17,250
how you get muscle
contraction and

956
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:21,270
behavior in the patellar
tendon reflex or any

957
00:56:21,270 --> 00:56:25,610
kind of sensory motor
circuit that exists. And

958
00:56:25,610 --> 00:56:27,630
obviously, the patellar
tendon reflex is an

959
00:56:27,630 --> 00:56:32,830
important clinical
evaluation tool, right?

960
00:56:36,510 --> 00:56:42,490
So, synaptic transmission,
or the physiology

961
00:56:42,490 --> 00:56:45,850
of synapses, has a
lot of different, you

962
00:56:45,850 --> 00:56:48,350
know, elements to it,
like we've mentioned.

963
00:56:48,350 --> 00:56:52,570
And in each of these
parts, you know, we have

964
00:56:52,570 --> 00:56:56,030
discussed underlying
anatomy and physiology.

965
00:56:56,030 --> 00:57:00,210
We didn't talk too
much about reuptake or

966
00:57:00,210 --> 00:57:03,790
reuptake of transmitter.
You'll cover that in

967
00:57:03,790 --> 00:57:05,730
your neurochemistry
lecture, but obviously

968
00:57:05,730 --> 00:57:08,470
this is going to be
a critical element to

969
00:57:08,470 --> 00:57:13,250
this whole cycle and of
neuron communication.

970
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:17,410
And we also
didn't talk about

971
00:57:17,410 --> 00:57:20,850
neurotransmitter
breakdown, but all of

972
00:57:20,850 --> 00:57:25,710
these different
concepts are areas

973
00:57:27,230 --> 00:57:30,910
where disease can
emerge, right? Disease

974
00:57:30,910 --> 00:57:34,970
can emerge when you
have something wrong

975
00:57:34,970 --> 00:57:37,470
with action potential
generation or something

976
00:57:37,470 --> 00:57:41,430
wrong with transmitter
reuptake or

977
00:57:41,430 --> 00:57:45,330
something wrong with
post-synaptic transmitter

978
00:57:45,330 --> 00:57:46,970
receptors, right? So
that's kind of how

979
00:57:46,970 --> 00:57:51,330
we get the biomedical
mechanisms of disease

980
00:57:51,330 --> 00:57:53,810
and why it's important
we know about

981
00:57:54,010 --> 00:57:56,590
these different concepts.
And I'll give you

982
00:57:56,590 --> 00:58:01,270
two more quick examples.
One is clinical

983
00:58:01,430 --> 00:58:04,410
correlations. One is
Lambert-Eaton syndrome.

984
00:58:04,410 --> 00:58:07,490
In Lambert-Eaton
syndrome, patients

985
00:58:07,490 --> 00:58:11,650
develop autoantibodies
for the voltage-gated

986
00:58:11,650 --> 00:58:14,650
calcium channels. So
now these channels

987
00:58:14,650 --> 00:58:17,250
are not working
properly because of

988
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:21,790
autoantibodies, right?
So, obviously, this is

989
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:24,810
going to affect
transmitter release, right?

990
00:58:26,830 --> 00:58:29,670
Particularly at the
neuromuscular junction

991
00:58:29,670 --> 00:58:32,170
is where you see
these symptoms, right?

992
00:58:32,170 --> 00:58:34,090
So, symptoms include
muscle weakness throughout

993
00:58:34,090 --> 00:58:36,330
the body, especially
limbs and face, as

994
00:58:36,330 --> 00:58:39,050
well as autonomic
symptoms. And the treatment

995
00:58:39,050 --> 00:58:42,090
options are going
to be at trying to,

996
00:58:42,770 --> 00:58:45,850
regulate what's
going on here, block

997
00:58:45,850 --> 00:58:49,690
the immune response,
or try to increase

998
00:58:49,690 --> 00:58:51,950
voltage-gated calcium
channel function.

999
00:58:52,490 --> 00:58:56,230
Another great example
is myasthenia gravis

1000
00:58:56,230 --> 00:58:59,870
that you might have
covered. In this disorder,

1001
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:04,210
patients produce
autoantibodies against

1002
00:59:04,210 --> 00:59:07,370
the acetylcholine
receptor. So here we have

1003
00:59:07,370 --> 00:59:10,490
our normal neuromuscular
junction and

1004
00:59:10,490 --> 00:59:12,850
acetylcholine being
released and our normal

1005
00:59:12,850 --> 00:59:16,230
acetylcholine receptors.
But here we have

1006
00:59:16,230 --> 00:59:20,190
acetylcholine receptor
antibodies that are now

1007
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:25,070
affecting the function
of that receptor, which

1008
00:59:25,070 --> 00:59:28,030
then causes symptoms
somewhat similar to

1009
00:59:28,030 --> 00:59:32,530
Lambert-Eaton, right?
weakness but obviously

1010
00:59:32,530 --> 00:59:36,910
this is a different site
a different mechanistic

1011
00:59:36,910 --> 00:59:39,610
site of where the
deficit is localized

1012
00:59:39,610 --> 00:59:42,090
it's not in the voltage
gated calcium channel

1013
00:59:42,090 --> 00:59:44,110
in this case it's
at the postsynaptic

1014
00:59:44,110 --> 00:59:50,690
receptor so we talked
about membrane potentials

1015
00:59:50,690 --> 00:59:52,230
we talked about
action potentials here

1016
00:59:52,230 --> 00:59:54,410
we talked about synaptic
connections and the

1017
00:59:54,410 --> 00:59:57,070
physiology right and
we covered we said

1018
00:59:57,070 --> 00:59:59,290
neurons are connected to
one another via chemical

1019
00:59:59,290 --> 01:00:02,450
and electrical synapses.
The postsynaptic

1020
01:00:02,450 --> 01:00:04,210
effect of a given
neurotransmitter will

1021
01:00:04,210 --> 01:00:06,450
depend on the type of
transmitter itself,

1022
01:00:06,450 --> 01:00:09,470
right, like glutamate or
GABA, and you'll learn

1023
01:00:09,470 --> 01:00:13,030
more about actual
different ion channels,

1024
01:00:13,410 --> 01:00:17,390
excuse me, postsynaptic
receptors. We talked

1025
01:00:17,390 --> 01:00:22,070
about two ionotropic
examples, one glutamate

1026
01:00:22,070 --> 01:00:24,590
and one GABA, and
then of course all the

1027
01:00:24,590 --> 01:00:26,530
players that we've
talked about in in these

1028
01:00:26,530 --> 01:00:29,130
first two lectures
neurons channels myelin

1029
01:00:29,130 --> 01:00:32,210
transmitters etc are
involved in synaptic

1030
01:00:32,210 --> 01:00:35,210
transmission they're
vulnerable sites to produce

1031
01:00:35,210 --> 01:00:38,630
disease and are also
then druggable targets

1032

1033
01:00:41,370 --> 01:00:45,890
