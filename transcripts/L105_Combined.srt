Video 1. Cranial
Nerves 3, 4, and 6 This

6
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:19,110
material represents
a distillation of

7
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:20,790
information that can
be found in Moore's

8
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,210
Clinically Oriented
Anatomy, Chapters 8 and

9
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:25,570
10. For more specific
information about

10
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,630
each cranial nerve,
I recommend reading

11
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:30,050
chapter 8 and paying
close attention to

12
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:32,790
the blue boxes slash
blue pages as they

13
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,490
highlight the many
clinically relevant

14
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:37,190
aspects about this area
of cranial anatomy.

15
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,370
This lecture series
will cover 9 of the 12

16
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:42,970
cranial nerves. The
special afferents,

17
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:45,990
cranial nerves 1, 2,
and 8, will be covered

18
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:47,910
in a future lecture.
Throughout this

19
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:49,850
lecture, I will make
reference to the endocranium

20
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,050
and the skull as
separate structures.

21
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,930
The reason for
this is because the

22
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:55,810
hole a cranial
nerve uses to exit

23
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:57,690
the endocranium may
not always be the

24
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,790
same hole used to
exit the skull.

25
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,250
This will be made clearer

26
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,430
in this second video.

27
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,610
The first cranial nerve
that we will cover

28
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:07,570
today is cranial
nerve 3, oculomotor.

29
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:09,950
This is the major motor
nerve for the eye.

30
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:12,130
The oculomotor nerve
leaves the brain and

31
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:15,490
courses rostrally towards
the orbit. It runs

32
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:18,070
lateral to the cella
tercica and inside

33
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:20,290
the lateral wall of
the cavernous sinus.

34
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:23,030
The oculomotor nerve
exits the endocranium

35
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:25,810
via the superior
orbital fissure. After

36
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:28,130
exiting the endocranium,
oculomotor passes

37
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,670
through the common
tendinous ring. This

38
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,630
is where most of the
extraocular muscles

39
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:34,870
attach, and it is an
important anatomical

40
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,990
landmark for structures
within the orbit.

41
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:40,370
Past the ring, oculomotor
splits into two

42
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:43,910
major divisions, a
superior division and an

43
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:46,630
inferior division.
The superior division

44
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:49,710
innervates just two
muscles, the superior ******

45
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,590
and the levator palpebrae
superioris, a muscle

46
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,070
of the upper eyelid.
The inferior division

47
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:57,850
of oculomotor innervates
medial ******,

48
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:02,150
inferior ******, and the
inferior oblique. The

49
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:04,270
inferior division is
also responsible for

50
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:07,570
sending presynaptic
parasympathetic fibers to

51
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:10,970
the ciliary ganglion.
From this ganglion,

52
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:13,710
nerve fibers continue
into the eye as the short

53
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,210
ciliary nerves, where
they innervate the

54
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:18,990
ciliary body and sphincter
pupillae muscles.

55
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:22,110
Clinical correlate.
The multiple structures

56
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,090
innervated by oculomotor
can be used to

57
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,090
determine the location
of an oculomotor

58
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:29,150
lesion. For instance,
pitosis, or drooping

59
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,950
upper eyelid, is a
paralysis or weakness to

60
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,290
the levator palpebrae
superioris muscle.

61
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,350
Drooping eyelids
are a sign of

62
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:37,550
a lesion to the superior

63
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,650
division of the
oculomotor nerve.

64
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:42,870
In contrast, a
weakened medial ******

65
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:45,070
indicates a lesion to
the inferior division

66
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:47,110
of the nerve. A
complete lesion to

67
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:49,330
oculomotor results
in the signature down

68
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:50,910
-and-out presentation
of the affected

69
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,770
eye due to paralysis
of the four

70
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:55,330
extraocular muscles
controlled by the nerve.

71
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:58,830
Lastly, an inability
to constrict the eye

72
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:00,790
against light
suggests damage to the

73
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,950
parasympathetic fibers
traveling to the

74
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:05,030
sphincter pupillae
muscle, indicating a

75
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:07,390
potential lesion to
either the short ciliary

76
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:10,210
nerves or the ciliary
ganglion itself.

77
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:12,630
This is called anisocoria
and can best be

78
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:15,350
seen in famed rock legend
David Bowie. Moving

79
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:18,690
on to cranial nerve 4,
the trochlear nerve.

80
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:21,690
The trochlear nerve
is the smallest of our

81
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:23,670
cranial nerves and
is the only nerve to

82
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,010
leave the brain from
its dorsal surface.

83
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:28,330
All other cranial
nerves leave the

84
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:30,310
brain from the
ventral surface. From

85
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,670
the brain, the
trochlear nerve

86
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,790
follows the same path
as the oculomotor

87
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,890
nerve within the
cavernous sinus.

88
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:38,570
The trochlear nerve
passes superior

89
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:40,310
to the oculomotor
in the sinus

90
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,110
before exiting
the endocranium

91
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:44,490
through the superior
orbital fissure.

92
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,970
The trochlear nerve
innervates a single

93
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:49,890
extraocular muscle,
the superior oblique.

94
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:52,150
The superior oblique
follows a unique

95
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,090
path from the common
tendinous ring to reach

96
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:56,770
the posterolateral
aspect of the eye.

97
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:59,170
To accomplish this
feat, the muscle passes

98
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:01,950
a long tendon through
a fibrous loop that

99
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,490
juts out from the medial
wall of the orbit.

100
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,830
This loop creates
a pulley, which

101
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,810
in Latin is
called a trochlea,

102
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,110
hence where the trochlear

103
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,390
nerve gets its name.

104
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:12,610
Clinical correlate.

105
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,670
Damage to the
trochlear nerve results

106
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,430
in weakness or
paralysis of the

107
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,110
superior oblique,
affecting the

108
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:20,130
ability to look down
or even straight.

109
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:23,050
Unopposed actions from
the inferior oblique

110
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:25,030
and superior ******
cause an upward

111
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:27,770
and inward deviation
to the affected eye.

112
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:29,870
The final cranial
nerve that we will be

113
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,970
looking at in this
video is cranial nerve

114
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:35,490
6, the abducens nerve.
The abducens, or

115
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:37,530
abducent nerve, leaves
the brain near the

116
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:39,750
pons medulla junction,
where it pierces the

117
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,130
dura mater near the
clivus of the skull.

118
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:45,270
From here, the nerve
crawls its way rostrally

119
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,590
towards the cavernous
sinus, following

120
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:50,070
the same general path
as both the trochlear

121
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:52,590
and oculomotor
nerve. The abducens

122
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:55,310
nerve lies furthest
medially within the

123
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:58,090
cavernous sinus before
it exits the endocranium

124
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,490
through the superior
orbital fissure.

125
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:03,110
Within the orbit, the
abducens nerve travels

126
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:05,050
straight to the
lateral ****** muscle,

127
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:07,570
the only muscle
innervated by this nerve.

128
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:11,230
Note the AB in abducens.
The name of the

129
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:13,230
nerve is based on the
function of lateral

130
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:16,310
******, which is
to abeduct the eye.

131
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:17,650
Clinical correlate.

132
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,570
Abducens nerve
lesions present as

133
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,250
a weakness or
paralysis of the

134
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,310
corresponding lateral
****** muscle.

135
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,570
The lack of antagonistic
action against

136
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:27,730
the medial ******
results in the affected

137
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:30,490
eye turning medially
towards the nose.

138
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:33,590
Abducens palsy is the
most common palsy of

139
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,330
the nerves that we
have looked at so far.

140
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:38,130
This is due to the more
medial location of the

141
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,510
abducens nerve within
the cavernous sinus.

142
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,510
This placement puts
the nerve closest

143
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,510
to the internal
carotid artery.

144
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:46,770
Blood clots in the
cavernous sinus, or

145
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:48,510
an aneurysm of the
internal carotid

146
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,310
within the sinus,
are more likely to

147
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:52,290
compress the abducens
nerve compared to

148
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,290
the other nerves
running in the sinus.

149
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:58,120
This brings us to
the end of video 1.

Video number 2,

4
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:09,290
Cranial Nerves 5 and 7.

5
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:12,450
Okay,

6
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:14,770
strap in for
this one, folks.

7
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:17,450
Although this video
only covers two of

8
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:20,950
the 12 cranial nerves,
these two nerves have

9
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:23,690
the most complicated
distribution in

10
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,710
the head and neck, as
they are responsible

11
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,730
for most of the
innervation in the head.

12
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:30,450
We are only asking
you to remember a

13
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:32,730
fraction of the
myriad branches that

14
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:35,530
form from these
two cranial nerves.

15
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:39,170
Now, for your sanity
and mine, I highly

16
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:41,570
recommend that you
don't focus too

17
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,590
much on the course
that these nerves

18
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,630
take as they move
through the head.

19
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:48,970
Instead, for each
branch discussed,

20
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:51,510
try to answer these
three questions.

21
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,030
What root or division is

22
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,150
the nerve coming from?

23
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:57,470
What exit does
it use for the

24
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:58,790
endocranium
and the skull?

25
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:00,270
This can occasionally

26
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,670
have two answers to it.

27
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:04,390
What does the
nerve innervate?

28
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:07,590
Finally, for the
trigeminal nerve,

29
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:10,110
lean heavily on these
dermatome images

30
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,630
from Moore's clinically
-oriented anatomy.

31
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:15,590
Understanding this
distribution of trigeminal

32
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:18,370
across the face will
go a long way to

33
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,970
answering trigeminal
-focused questions.

34
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:23,050
Now that we've prepared,

35
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:24,490
it's time to get started.

36
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:29,070
Cranial Nerve
5 – Trigeminal

37
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:32,250
This is the largest
cranial nerve and is

38
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,770
responsible for most
of the sensation

39
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:35,950
to the head. The
name trigeminal is

40
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:38,450
derived from the Latin
word for triplet and

41
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:40,530
refers to the nerve's
unique branching

42
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,930
pattern off the
brain. The trigeminal

43
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,810
nerve originates
from the pons as a

44
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:47,130
collection of nerve
rootlets that travel a

45
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:49,790
short distance
anteriorly off the brain.

46
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:53,150
Most of these rootlets
enter a large ganglion

47
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,310
located lateral to
the cavernous sinus.

48
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:57,890
This is the
trigeminal ganglion.

49
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:00,270
Distal to the
trigeminal ganglion,

50
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,010
trigeminal
splits into three

51
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:04,050
different nerves
or divisions,

52
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:06,330
the triplets
of trigeminal.

53
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,950
These three big
divisions are

54
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:12,970
ophthalmic, maxillary,
and mandibular.

55
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:17,650
Also called cranial
nerves 5.1, 5.2, and

56
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:21,330
5.3, or as you will
likely hear in lab and

57
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:25,910
throughout your
career, V1, V2, and V3.

58
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:29,370
Let's take each
division one at a time.

59
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:32,890
Trigeminal 5
.1, ophthalmic.

60
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:36,090
This is the smallest
of the three divisions.

61
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,330
It arises from the
trigeminal ganglion

62
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:40,510
and follows a course
very similar to the

63
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:43,230
previous cranial nerves
discussed in video 1.

64
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:46,170
Ophthalmic travels
through the lateral wall

65
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:49,130
of the cavernous sinus
and exits the endocranium

66
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:51,550
through the superior
orbital fissure.

67
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,110
Ophthalmic comes from
the ancient Greek

68
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:57,070
word for the eye. The
name informs us about

69
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:59,390
what the nerve does
and where it goes.

70
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:03,050
Ophthalmic is a purely
sensory nerve. It

71
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:05,050
provides sensation to
the front of the face

72
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,010
above the eyebrows
and will send and

73
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:10,090
extensions posteriorly
to the occipital bone.

74
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:13,090
Once beyond the superior
orbital fissure,

75
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,070
the ophthalmic nerve
splits into three

76
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:19,010
nerves – frontal,
nasociliary, and lacrimal.

77
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,090
The frontal nerve
travels along

78
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:23,850
the roof of the
orbit and further

79
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:26,310
splits into two
terminal nerves.

80
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:29,590
The first nerve is the
supraorbital nerve.

81
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,750
It provides sensory
innervation to the skin

82
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,630
of the scalp, forehead,
and upper eyelid.

83
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:37,370
The supraorbital
nerve exits the

84
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:40,530
skull via the
supraorbital foramen or

85
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,290
supraorbital
notch, depending on

86
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,050
how well-developed
that opening is.

87
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:46,370
The second terminal
branch of the frontal

88
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:49,650
nerve is the
supratrochlear nerve. As

89
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,830
its name implies, the
nerve lies just above

90
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:54,050
the trochlea on the
medial wall of the

91
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:57,110
orbit. It exits the
skull via the medial

92
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:59,610
orbital rim and
provides sensory

93
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:02,210
innervation to the
midline of the brow ridge.

94
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:04,770
The next branch
from the ophthalmic

95
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:07,150
division is the
nasociliary nerve.

96
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:10,010
This nerve initially
follows the frontal

97
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:11,930
nerve before
splitting off to

98
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:14,250
travel inferior to
the optic nerve and

99
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,990
more anteromedially
through the orbit.

100
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:18,890
Here, it splits into

101
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:20,670
several terminal
branches.

102
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:23,710
Two of those branches
form the anterior

103
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:26,230
and posterior
ethmoidal nerves.

104
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:28,630
These go through the
medial wall of the

105
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,250
orbit to enter into
the ethmoid bone, where

106
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,790
they traverse the
nasal cavity and

107
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:35,690
paranasal sinuses, providing
sensory innervation

108
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:37,690
to the structures
in these regions.

109
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:40,310
Returning to the
nasociliary nerve,

110
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,850
as it passes over
the optic nerve, the

111
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:45,390
nasociliary nerve
sends off two or three

112
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:48,190
branches called the
long ciliary nerves.

113
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:50,950
These nerves provide
sensation to the

114
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,630
rest of the eyeball
and act as conduits

115
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,490
for sympathetic
nerve fibers coming

116
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:57,690
from the superior
cervical ganglion.

117
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:00,030
The final branch
of the nasociliary

118
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:02,710
nerve is the
infratrochlear nerve.

119
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,230
As its name implies,
infratrochlear travels

120
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:09,090
inferior to the trochlea
along the medial

121
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:11,670
wall of the orbit
before exiting the skull

122
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:14,310
via the medial
orbital rim to provide

123
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,770
cutaneous innervation
to most of the nose,

124
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:19,790
eyelids, and conjunctiva.
The final branch of

125
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:21,710
the ophthalmic division
is the lacrimal

126
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:24,210
nerve. This is the
smallest nerve off the

127
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:26,370
ophthalmic division and
is the only nerve that

128
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:29,110
travels laterally
after the trifurcation.

129
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:31,210
The lacrimal nerve
travels straight

130
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:32,670
to the lacrimal
gland in the

131
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:35,330
superolateral corner
of the orbital rim.

132
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:37,630
The lacrimal nerve
will provide sensory

133
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:40,550
innervation to the
lacrimal gland. I repeat,

134
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:43,890
sensory innervation.
The motor innervation

135
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:45,990
to the lacrimal gland
comes from elsewhere.

136
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,450
That covers the first

137
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:48,770
division of trigeminal.

138
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:51,490
Time to move on to the
next. cranial nerve

139
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:55,370
5-2, the maxillary. As
with ophthalmic, the

140
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:58,070
maxillary division
is entirely afferent.

141
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:01,150
However, unlike the
ophthalmic division, most

142
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:03,510
of the branches of the
maxillary division go

143
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:06,050
deep into the skull
and are very difficult

144
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:09,010
to see in a dissection.
The maxillary division

145
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:11,590
extends from the
trigeminal ganglion and

146
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:14,410
courses inferrorostrally
into the middle

147
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:17,670
cranial fossa, where it
exits the endocranium

148
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:20,550
via the foramen
rotundum. The maxillary

149
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:23,010
division sends out multiple
nerves to the head.

150
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:26,190
We will focus on just
five of these nerves.

151
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,730
The greater
palatine, the lesser

152
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:31,510
palatine, the
nasopalatine,

153
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:35,050
the zygomatic, and the
infraorbital nerve.

154
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:37,310
Shortly after entering
into the foramen

155
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,330
rotundum, the maxillary
division takes

156
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,470
two different paths
through the skull.

157
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:44,310
One path descends
the skull through an

158
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,810
opening called the
pterygopalatine fossa.

159
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,770
Within this fossa,
multiple branches

160
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:51,050
of the maxillary division

161
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:53,550
enter the
pterygopalatine ganglion.

162
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:56,670
This ganglion acts
as a junction between

163
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:58,590
the trigeminal
and facial nerves.

164
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:01,430
All of the trigeminal
fibers continue through

165
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:05,370
the ganglion without
synapsing. They exit

166
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:08,390
the pterygopalatine
ganglion as three different

167
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:11,590
terminal nerves. The
first two are the

168
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:14,210
greater and lesser
palatine nerves. They will

169
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:17,090
continue inferiorly
through the pterygopalatine

170
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:19,230
fossa until they exit
the skull through

171
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,650
the greater and lesser
palatine foramina.

172
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:24,710
The greater palatine
nerve conveys sensory

173
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,490
information from
the hard palate,

174
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:29,090
whereas the lesser
palatine nerve conveys

175
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:31,490
sensory information
from the soft palate.

176
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:34,210
The final terminal
nerve in this group

177
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:37,210
is the nasopalatine
nerve. This nerve

178
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:39,750
leaves the pterygopalatine
ganglion and

179
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,530
courses rostrally
into the nasal cavity.

180
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:45,390
Here, it provides
sensory innervation to

181
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:47,730
the lower half of
the nasal septum and

182
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:50,390
the mucosa along the
lateral nasal walls.

183
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:53,150
This nerve will
eventually exit the

184
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:55,710
skull through the
incisive canal, where

185
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,570
it provides sensory
innervation to the

186
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:00,010
rostralmost part
of the hard palate.

187
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:02,470
The second path
of the maxillary

188
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:05,010
division runs rosterally
from the foramen

189
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:07,650
rotundum into the
inferior orbital

190
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:10,430
fissure. Within this
fissure, the maxillary

191
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,710
division splits
into two nerves.

192
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:15,870
The first nerve is
the zygomatic nerve.

193
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,970
This nerve courses
along the lateral

194
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,710
wall of the orbit
and splits into

195
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:22,950
two terminal branches,
the zygomaticofacial

196
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:25,170
and zygomaticotemporal
nerves.

197
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:28,330
These two terminal
nerves will exit the

198
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:31,190
skull via foramina
of the same name and

199
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:33,430
go on to provide
sensory innervation to

200
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,570
their respective
portions of the head.

201
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:38,390
The second nerve to
branch within the

202
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,770
inferior orbital
fissure is the aptly

203
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,770
named infraorbital
nerve. The infraorbital

204
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:45,710
nerve courses
along the inferior

205
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:47,910
margin of the orbit
within a small

206
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:50,570
groove called the
infraorbital groove.

207
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,370
Along its course,
the infraorbital

208
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:55,650
nerve sends out
multiple small branches

209
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,730
into the maxillary
sinus and the

210
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:00,110
upper teeth. These
branches form

211
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:03,610
the anterior, middle,
and posterior,

212
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:07,650
superior alveolar
nerves. They provide

213
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:10,270
sensory innervation to
the teeth and gingiva

214
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:12,450
of the upper jaw.
The infraorbital

215
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:15,290
nerve eventually exits
the skull via the

216
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:18,670
infraorbital foramen.
Here, the nerve provides

217
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,110
sensory innervation
for the lower

218
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:22,650
eyelids, sides of the
nose, and upper lip.

219
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:26,070
That's two divisions
down, just one to go.

220
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:28,690
The third and
final division

221
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:30,410
of the trigeminal
nerve is the

222
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:32,710
mandibular
division, or 5-3.

223
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:35,310
This division of
trigeminal stands

224
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:37,290
apart from the rest
as it is the only

225
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:39,630
division that incorporates
a motor component.

226
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:41,870
The motor component
of the mandibular

227
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,670
nerve begins as
motor rootlets

228
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:47,350
leaving the pons.
These rootlets do not

229
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:49,610
pass through the
trigeminal ganglion.

230
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:53,110
Instead, they pass
inferior to the ganglion

231
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:55,570
in an area called
the trigeminal cave.

232
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:58,970
This makes the trigeminal
ganglion a solely

233
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:02,230
sensory ganglion.
Motor and sensory

234
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:05,950
components of 5-3 fuse
together past the trigeminal

235
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:08,130
ganglion to form the
mandibular division

236
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:10,810
of trigeminal, which
then quickly exits

237
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:13,310
the endocranium through
the foramen ovale.

238
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:18,190
The mandibular division
descends the skull

239
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:20,910
through the infratemporal
fossa. This is a

240
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:23,390
soft tissue space that
you will see in lab.

241
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:26,050
Within the fossa, the
mandibular division

242
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:29,050
quickly splits into
four sensory nerves,

243
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:33,270
the auriculotemporal,
the buccal, the lingual,

244
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:36,890
and the inferior
alveolar nerve. The

245
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:39,510
auriculotemporal nerve
provides sensation to

246
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,910
the ears and the temporal
region of the head.

247
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:44,550
The auriculotemporal
nerve is unique as

248
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:48,050
it forms from two separate
roots, the superior

249
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:51,670
and inferior root.
These roots pass around

250
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,700
the middle meningeal
artery before

251
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,630
anastomosing to form the
auriculotemporal nerve.

252
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:59,990
The buccal nerve, or
long buccal nerve,

253
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:02,830
splits off the mandibular
division and courses

254
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:05,550
rostrally through the
infratemporal fossa,

255
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:07,930
passing between both
heads of the lateral

256
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:10,290
pterygoid muscle.
The buccal nerve will

257
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:12,150
provide sensory
innervation to the mucous

258
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:14,430
membranes of the cheeks,
and may also send out

259
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:16,530
branches that provide
accessory sensory

260
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:19,150
innervation to the
second and third molars.

261
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:22,530
Do not confuse the
buccal nerve with

262
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:24,190
the buccal branch
of the facial

263
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:26,370
nerve, which we will
look at in a bit.

264
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:29,390
The buccal nerve is
strictly a sensory

265
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:31,570
nerve that has no
motor components.

266
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:34,550
The inferior alveolar
nerve is largely

267
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:36,830
a continuation of the
mandibular division

268
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:39,050
of trigeminal. It
descends through

269
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:41,210
the infratemporal
fossa and enters

270
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:43,330
the mandible at the
mandibular foramen.

271
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:46,050
From here, the nerve
courses through the

272
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:48,390
mandibular canal,
sending out multiple

273
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:50,610
branches to the teeth
of the mandible.

274
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:53,990
At the rostral, or
mesial, end of the

275
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:56,350
mandibular ramus,
the inferior alveolar

276
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,750
nerve exits the skull
through the mental

277
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,350
foramen. At this
foramen, we change the

278
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,070
name of the nerve
to the mental nerve.

279
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,270
The mental nerve
innervates the

280
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:07,190
skin of the chin
and lower lip.

281
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:09,790
The final sensory
branch of the

282
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:12,170
mandibular division
is the lingual nerve.

283
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:14,970
The lingual nerve branches
off the mandibular

284
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:17,450
division and runs
parallel to the inferior

285
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:19,510
alveolar nerve
through much of the

286
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:22,510
infratemporal fossa.
Near where the inferior

287
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:25,410
alveolar nerve enters
the mandibular foramen,

288
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,890
the lingual nerve
makes a sharp turn

289
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:32,010
rostromedially to enter
the oral cavity. Inside

290
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:34,150
the oral cavity, the
lingual nerve courses

291
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:36,270
into the tongue where
it provides somatic

292
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:39,390
sensory innervation to
the anterior two-thirds

293
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:42,030
of the tongue. That
covers the afferent

294
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,810
component of the
mandibular division of

295
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:46,530
trigeminal. Although the
motor component is the

296
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:49,190
smallest portion of the
mandibular division,

297
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:51,750
these motor actions
are very important.

298
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:54,110
This is because
the motor component

299
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,890
of the mandibular
division innervates

300
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:58,010
all of the muscles
of mastication.

301
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:00,590
These nerves are what
let us chew food.

302
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:04,590
There are five terminal
nerves of importance

303
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:07,110
for mastication.
Each nerve goes to

304
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:09,250
its respective
masticatory muscle, and

305
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,370
they are self
-explanatory. These nerves

306
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:13,070
are all named for
the muscles that they

307
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:15,610
innervate. The only
exception to this is

308
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:18,530
the nerve to
myelohyoid. This nerve

309
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:21,590
innervates both the
myelohyoid muscle and the

310
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:23,730
anterior belly of
the digastric muscle.

311
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:26,470
The nerve to
myelohyoid appears as a

312
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:29,230
split in the inferior
alveolar nerve just

313
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:31,230
before it enters the
mandibular foramen.

314
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:34,330
Whereas the inferior
alveolar nerve takes

315
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:36,310
an intraosseous
course through the

316
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:38,990
mandible, the nerve
to myelohyoid travels

317
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:41,710
externally along the
medial side of the

318
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:44,430
mandibular ramus to
reach its target muscles.

319
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:47,150
The complex interplay
between the various

320
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:49,290
muscles of mastication
and their firing

321
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:52,230
patterns is too detailed
for this video, or

322
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,970
frankly even a first
year of med school.

323
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:55,990
No, really, people
devote entire

324
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:58,250
careers to studying
chewing. For the

325
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,650
purposes of this course,
I would recommend

326
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:03,790
studying figure
8.72 in Mors and

327
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,750
reading the section
on mastication.

328
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,330
Along with that,

329
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:09,270
remember the
following pieces of

330
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:12,110
information. Temporalis,
masseter, and

331
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:15,490
medial pterygoid all
act as jaw closers.

332
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:18,750
Lateral pterygoid,
myelohyoid,

333
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,750
anterior digastric,
and gravity

334
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,990
all act to
open the mouth.

335
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:27,630
There are a few other
muscles that will also

336
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:30,070
act on the jaw, such
as the posterior belly

337
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:33,070
of digastric and
geniohyoid, but they are

338
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:35,630
not considered true
muscles of mastication.

339
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:38,130
We call these accessory
muscles of mastication

340
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:40,430
as it's gravity that's
doing most of the

341
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:43,490
work. The final two
branches of the mandibular

342
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:45,530
division of trigeminal
are the nerves

343
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:48,370
to tensor velle palatine
and tensor tympani.

344
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:51,830
Both nerves arise
from the otic ganglion

345
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:54,000
along with the nerve
to medial pterygoid.

346
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,190
The otic ganglion is
yet another ganglion

347
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:59,670
associated with the
trigeminal nerve, and

348
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,790
it is also yet another
ganglion that the

349
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:04,550
trigeminal nerve merely
passes through without

350
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:07,310
synapsing. The otic
ganglion is important

351
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:09,310
for the autonomics
of the face, which

352
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:11,030
will be dealt with in
a separate lecture.

353
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,950
The nerve to tensor
velle palatine innervates

354
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,850
the muscle of the
same name. This

355
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:18,490
muscle functions in
tensing the soft palate,

356
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:20,110
turning it from
a pliable surface

357
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:22,030
into a stiffened
board that could

358
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,690
be elevated as
a single unit,

359
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,650
allowing for proper
food swallowing.

360
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,410
We'll return to this in

361
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:28,790
more detail in video 3.

362
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:31,350
Importantly, the
tendon of tensor

363
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:33,350
velle palatine
also attaches to

364
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,010
the base of the
eustachian tube.

365
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:37,210
When tensor velle
palatine contracts,

366
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:39,630
it opens the
eustachian tube,

367
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,670
equalizing pressure
on the inside of

368
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:44,510
the ear, causing
your ears to pop.

369
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:47,190
The nerve to tensor
tympani travels

370
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:48,910
to the tensor
tympani muscle in the

371
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,950
ear. This is a
small muscle that

372
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,230
attaches to the
malleus, the ear ossicle

373
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,830
connected to the
tympanic membrane.

374
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:57,770
When tensor tympani
contracts, it stiffens

375
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:59,810
the tympanic membrane,
making it harder

376
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:02,250
for sound waves to
shake the ear ossicles,

377
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:05,310
resulting in dulled
sounds. Tensor tympani

378
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:07,290
activates in
response to very loud

379
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:09,890
sounds and functions
to shield the inner ear

380
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:12,170
from damage in high
-noise environments.

381
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:13,910
We will cover this
in more detail

382
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,730
in this special
afference lecture,

383
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:17,010
clinical correlate.

384
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:19,350
As the hub for somatic
sensory innervation

385
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:21,390
to the face, the
troubles with trigeminal

386
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:24,170
often present as pain
or numbness to portions

387
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:26,590
of the face. A common
clinical problem

388
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:29,590
associated with trigeminal
is trigeminal neuralgia,

389
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:32,190
otherwise known as
tic de la rue. This

390
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:34,530
is the result of
misfiring from one or more

391
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:37,150
sensory branches of
trigeminal on the face.

392
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:39,530
Patients come in
complaining of short

393
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:41,990
-lived but intense
stabbing pains on

394
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:44,390
their face in response
to anything from

395
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:46,690
a gentle touch to
a slight breeze.

396
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:49,410
Tic de la Rue has a
large impact on patient

397
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:51,390
quality of life, with
patients suffering

398
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:53,570
from it going to
great lengths to avoid

399
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:56,210
stimulating the affected
portion of their face.

400
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:58,470
The underlying
causes of Tic de la

401
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,970
Rue are variable
and mostly unknown.

402
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,630
Treatment varies from
local anesthetic to

403
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:06,190
partial or even complete
nerve resection.

404
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,830
Damage to the
motor component of

405
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:10,730
trigeminal often
manifests as

406
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:13,810
temporomandibular
joint or TMJ problems.

407
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:15,950
The proximal cause of
the patient's trouble

408
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:18,170
is usually the joint
itself, but the

409
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,730
underlying issues that
produce TMJ problems

410
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:22,770
in the first place
can be attributed to

411
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:25,090
misfiring of the
muscles of mastication,

412
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:27,550
which can misalign the
teeth, producing jaw

413
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:30,230
tenderness, tooth
damage, and headaches.

414
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,030
Wow,

415
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:35,570
okay. That will cover
all the important

416
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:37,990
branches of the
trigeminal nerve.

417
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,230
Awesome job making
it this far in.

418
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:42,010
It's time to take
a break. Get a good

419
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:43,910
stretch in, maybe
make a sandwich.

420
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,470
But before heading
off and preparing for

421
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:50,050
the facial nerve,
I want to briefly

422
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:51,910
look at this part of
the self-assessment.

423
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:55,090
See how you are asked
to diagrammatically

424
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:56,650
draw out the
branches of the

425
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,950
trigeminal nerve?
I recommend keeping

426
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:01,230
this part simple.
For instance,

427
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:03,090
let's draw the
branches of

428
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:04,950
the ophthalmic
real quick.

429
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:09,970
Here's the brain.

430
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:13,450
There's the trigeminal
ganglion. Off we

431
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:16,430
go to the frontal,
nasociliary and lacrimal

432
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:18,790
nerves. Off frontal
we'll add the

433
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:22,590
supraorbital and supratrochlear.
From nasociliary,

434
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,490
we'll toss in the
ethmoidal nerves,

435
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:27,490
long ciliary nerves,
and the infratrochlear

436
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:29,930
nerve. We can then
put some simple

437
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:32,810
brackets in for the
endocranium exits, some

438
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:34,910
nerve-specific notes
along the side, and

439
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:37,250
finally a note that
everything we just

440
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,090
did was for a nerve
that is only afferent.

441
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:44,870
Of course, you
don't have to do it

442
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:47,190
this way. Feel
free to choose the

443
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:49,190
drawing method that
works best for you.

444
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:51,710
Okay then,
quick break and

445
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:53,110
on to our last
cranial nerve.

446
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:07,750
Cranial nerve 7,
the facial nerve.

447
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:10,830
If the trigeminal
nerve is the main

448
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,710
afferent nerve
for the face, the

449
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:14,650
facial nerve is the
main motor nerve.

450
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:17,110
The facial nerve
innervates all of the

451
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,990
muscles of facial
expression, which are

452
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:21,630
about 20 or so. The
facial nerve also

453
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:24,010
innervates most of the
glands in your head.

454
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:27,070
Glandular innervation
is all autonomic

455
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:28,670
and so will be
covered in a separate

456
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:31,850
autonomics lecture. The
facial nerve starts as

457
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:33,630
two routes that
leave the junction of

458
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,730
the pons and medulla.
The larger route is

459
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:39,010
called the primary
route, or the facial

460
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:41,670
nerve proper. This
route innervates all

461
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:44,390
of the muscles of
facial expression. The

462
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:46,330
smaller route is
called the intermediate

463
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:48,870
route, or intermediate
nerve, as it is

464
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:51,070
the autonomic branch
of the facial nerve.

465
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:53,990
Shortly after leaving
the brain, both

466
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:55,970
routes quickly
combine to form the

467
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:58,470
facial nerve. The
newly formed nerve

468
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:01,090
travels laterally in
the posterior cranial

469
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:03,530
fossa before exiting
the endocranium

470
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:06,450
through the internal
acoustic meatus.

471
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:09,380
The facial nerve shares
this exit with the

472
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:12,010
vestibulocochlear
nerve, cranial nerve 8.

473
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,670
However, the facial
nerve is the only

474
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:16,810
nerve that will later
leave the skull.

475
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:19,430
Shortly after
entering the internal

476
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:21,970
acoustic meatus, the
facial nerve travels

477
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:24,050
posteriorly through
the walls of the middle

478
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:26,510
ear within the facial
canal. Now, this

479
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:28,330
gives the facial
nerve the longest

480
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:31,350
intraosseous course
of any cranial nerve.

481
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:33,430
The area where
the facial nerve

482
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:35,310
changes direction
is called the

483
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:37,150
geniculum of the
facial nerve.

484
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:39,810
Genu is Latin for
knee, and it is

485
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:41,510
here where the
facial nerve expands

486
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,470
into a ganglion
of nerve fibers

487
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:45,230
called the
geniculate ganglion.

488
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:47,600
The geniculate
ganglion is another

489
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,290
ganglion that will
be more important

490
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,910
to you later when
discussing the

491
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:53,150
autonomic component
of the facial nerve.

492
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:56,130
For the purposes of
this video, the ganglion

493
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,690
serves as a helpful
landmark to locate the

494
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:01,230
start of three
branches of the facial

495
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:04,850
nerve. The greater petrosal
nerve, a communicating

496
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:07,210
branch that will join
the lesser petrosal

497
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:10,170
nerve, and the external
petrosal nerve.

498
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:12,480
These three
nerves will send

499
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,270
autonomics from
the facial nerve to

500
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:16,310
various locations
in the head.

501
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:19,030
Beyond the geniculate
ganglion, the

502
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:21,130
facial nerve courses
around the tympanum,

503
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:23,530
making a C-shaped
curve around the

504
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:25,410
middle ear until
the nerve eventually

505
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:28,070
courses anteriorly
through the skull.

506
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:30,910
As the facial nerve
passes by our middle

507
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:33,390
ear ossicle, the
stapes, it will send

508
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:35,590
out a small branch
into the middle ear

509
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:38,150
cavity to innervate
the stapedius muscle.

510
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:40,910
As with tensor tympani,
the stapedius muscle

511
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:43,390
functions as a sound
dampener during times

512
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:46,650
of intense noise. We
will revisit stapedius

513
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:48,850
as well in the special
afference lecture.

514
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:52,230
Continuing antero
-inferiorly around the

515
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:54,030
middle ear, the
facial nerve sends out

516
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:56,910
another special branch
called cordotympani.

517
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:59,290
This nerve briefly
crosses through

518
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:01,390
the middle ear before
exiting the skull

519
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:03,770
through the petro
-tympanic fissure.

520
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,140
Cordotympani will
enter the infratemporal

521
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:08,130
fossa where it joins
with the lingual

522
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:10,930
nerve and rides that
nerve into the tongue.

523
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:13,170
We will return to
cordotympani in the

524
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:14,990
special afference
lecture as well.

525
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:16,690
The remaining
parts of the

526
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:18,430
facial nerve exit
the skull through

527
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:20,310
the stylomastoid foramen.

528
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:23,930
Immediately after
exiting the stylomastoid

529
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:26,410
foramen, the facial
nerve sends a branch

530
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:29,490
posteriorly to wrap
around the ear. This

531
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:32,150
is the posterior
auricular nerve. It will

532
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:34,050
innervate a vestigial
muscle of the ear

533
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:36,610
that pulls the ears
back in other animals.

534
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:39,330
Continuing antero
-inferiorly,

535
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:40,830
the facial nerve
sends out a

536
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:42,910
branch to the
digastric muscle.

537
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:45,370
This branch will
innervate the posterior

538
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:47,910
belly of the
digastric muscle. This

539
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:50,850
gives digastric dual
innervation. The

540
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:53,330
anterior belly receives
innervation from the

541
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:56,110
nerve to myelohyoid,
a branch of 5-3,

542
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:58,390
whereas the posterior
belly gets the

543
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:01,170
digastric branch of
the facial nerve. The

544
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:03,310
rest of the facial
nerve will continue

545
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,910
anteroinferiorly to
enter the parotid

546
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:08,490
gland where it explodes
out to form the

547
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:10,850
parotid plexus deep
within the gland.

548
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:13,350
Here, the facial
nerve splits out

549
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,910
into five different
motor branches.

550
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:18,990
These five branches
innervate all 20

551
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:21,930
or so facial muscles.
The five branches

552
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:24,030
of the parotid plexus
are named based

553
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:26,190
on where they are
going, but in a

554
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:29,170
generally superior to
inferior direction,

555
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:32,690
they are the
temporal, zygomatic,

556
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:35,770
buccal, marginal
mandibular, and

557
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:38,070
cervical branches
of the facial nerve.

558
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:42,030
A popular mnemonic
for remembering the

559
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:44,210
branches of the
facial nerve is To

560
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:47,290
Zanzibar by Motor Car
However, there are

561
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:49,290
dozens of alternative
mnemonics as

562
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:51,910
well, such as Tiny
Zebras Bit My Cheeks,

563
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:54,390
as well as several
dirtier versions

564
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:56,850
Now, the distribution
pattern of

565
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:58,150
the parotid plexus
that I've shown

566
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:00,310
here is a very
general pattern

567
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:02,530
Cadaveric studies
have found that

568
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:04,950
branching, or
arborization pattern, of

569
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:07,530
the parotid plexus
is highly variable

570
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:10,670
You will be tested
on this ideal version

571
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:12,510
I've shown here
for the purpose of

572
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:14,390
learning the
material, but don't be

573
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:16,450
surprised if the donors
in lab don't show

574
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:18,270
this same pattern
as few people will

575
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:20,610
have this exact
pattern in real life.

576
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:23,290
Of all the branches
of the parotid plexus,

577
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:24,990
the most important
one to understand

578
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:27,590
is the buccal branch
of the facial nerve.

579
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:29,230
This branch innervates

580
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:30,450
the buccinator muscle,

581
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:32,730
a facial muscle that
tenses the cheeks,

582
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:34,810
allowing for
suckling, *******,

583
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:36,910
whistling, brass
instrument playing, etc.

584
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:40,090
Do not confuse the buccal
branch of the facial

585
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:42,850
nerve with the buccal
nerve of trigeminal.

586
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:45,150
The former is the
motor innervation for

587
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:48,130
buccinator. The latter is
the sensory innervation

588
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:50,890
of the cheek mucosa.
When you suck your

589
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:52,870
cheeks into your mouth,
you are using the

590
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:55,410
buccal branch of facial.
When you feel the

591
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,770
pain of accidentally
biting those cheeks, you

592
00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:00,270
are using the buccal
nerve from trigeminal.

593
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:03,750
Clinical correlate
The most common

594
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,190
clinical correlate
associated with

595
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:07,150
the facial nerve
is Bell's palsy.

596
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:09,650
This is the result
of a lesion to one or

597
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:11,990
more branches of the
parotid plexus, resulting

598
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:14,110
in partial to complete
paralysis of the

599
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:16,370
muscles of facial expression
on the ipsilateral

600
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:18,410
side of the face
where the lesion is.

601
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:20,890
Bell's palsy is often

602
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:22,650
idiopathic and temporary.

603
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:25,650
However, in some cases,
such as with Sylvester

604
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:28,290
Stallone, Bell's palsy
can be permanent.

605
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:30,830
In the case of Stallone,
his was acquired

606
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,650
during birth, where
labor complications

607
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:35,110
forced the doctor to
use forceps. In the

608
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:37,530
process, the doctor
accidentally damaged some

609
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:39,910
branches of his right
parotid plexus, producing

610
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:41,930
his characteristic
facial expression.

611
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:47,730
Congratulations on
surviving our whirlwind

612
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:49,850
tour of the two most
complicated cranial

613
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:52,330
nerves in the head.
It's time for a break.

614
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:55,550
This brings us to
the end of video two.

1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,930
Paths and functions
of somatic afferents

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:05,010
and efferents of
the head and neck.

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:09,850
Video 3. Cranial nerves
9 through 12. This

4
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:11,870
is the final video
in the series and

5
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:14,010
will cover the remaining
cranial nerves.

6
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,870
As with video 2, I
recommend focusing

7
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:19,450
more on where the nerve
exits the endocranium

8
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:21,630
and skull and what
it innervates.

9
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,310
Cranial nerve 9. The
glossopharyngeal nerve.

10
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:27,810
nerve. This is the
main sensory nerve of

11
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,970
the pharynx, and is
responsible for both the

12
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,050
general and special
sense of taste for the

13
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:34,520
proximal one-third
of the tongue. The

14
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,490
glossopharyngeal nerve is
mostly a sensory nerve,

15
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:40,350
but it does contain a
single motor component

16
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:43,190
along with some autonomics.
This motor component

17
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:45,410
innervates the
stylopharyngeus muscle.

18
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:47,870
Glossopharyngeal leaves
the brain from the

19
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:50,370
medulla, where it exits
the endocranium and

20
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,430
the skull through the
jugular foramen. Just

21
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,050
inferior to the foramen,
the glossopharyngeal

22
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:59,610
nerve forms two
successive swellings, the

23
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:03,210
superior ganglion and
the inferior or petrous

24
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,630
ganglion. This is
where the afferent cell

25
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:07,910
bodies of the
glossopharyngeal nerve live.

26
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,690
Glossopharyngeal then
descends the neck,

27
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:13,230
running parallel to
the stylopharyngeus

28
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,650
muscle, sending branches

29
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,610
out to innervate
it as it goes.

30
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,110
Beyond stylopharyngeus,
the glossopharyngeal

31
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:22,010
nerve dives between
the superior

32
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:24,350
and middle pharyngeal
constrictor muscles,

33
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,350
sending out
multiple branches to

34
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:28,630
the pharyngeal plexus
as it descends.

35
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,310
These branches will
provide somatic sensory

36
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:33,670
information for
the entire pharynx.

37
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,430
Glossopharyngeal will
surface again on the

38
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,730
anterior side of the
pharyngeal constrictors,

39
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:40,930
where it terminates
in the posterior side

40
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:43,290
of the tongue,
innervating the proximal

41
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:46,070
one-third. The
glossopharyngeal nerve rarely

42
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:48,350
suffers damage and does
not really have any

43
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,550
common clinical
presentations associated

44
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:53,570
with it, so we'll move
on. The next nerve on

45
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:55,950
our tour is one that
we are all too familiar

46
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,430
with, cranial nerve
10, the vagus nerve.

47
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:01,970
Vagus comes from
the Latin word for

48
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:04,550
wandering or straying
and is a most apt

49
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,930
name for this cranial
nerve. The vagus

50
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,790
nerve is the only
cranial nerve to

51
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:11,290
extend beyond the head
and neck. The vagus

52
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,630
nerve serves as
the main carrier of

53
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,970
parasympathetic
innervation for the axial

54
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:18,550
region of the body,
sending branches as

55
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,730
far down as the first
two-thirds of the

56
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:23,150
transverse colon and
all of the kidneys.

57
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,370
There are even a
few branches that

58
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:27,010
sneak their way down
to the genitalia.

59
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,850
Vagus should be no
stranger to you at this

60
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,550
point, as we have
seen most of these

61
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:35,030
branches in previous
lectures and labs. For this

62
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,090
video, I'm only
going to focus on the

63
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,490
functions of vagus
within the head and neck.

64
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:42,010
The vagus nerve exits
the brain from the

65
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:44,710
medulla and travels
out the endocranium and

66
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:47,950
skull via the jugular
foramen. Similar to

67
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,810
the glossopharyngeal
nerve, the vagus

68
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:52,890
nerve will also form
two small swellings in

69
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:56,050
the jugular foramen, the
superior and inferior

70
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:59,810
ganglia of vagus. The
superior or jugular

71
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:02,030
ganglion is the
afferent component of

72
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:05,630
vagus, whereas the
inferior or nodos ganglion

73
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,750
handles the autonomic
motor functions.

74
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,530
In the head and neck,
there are just three

75
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:13,130
major branches of
the vagus nerve. The

76
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:15,750
pharyngeal branch,
the superior laryngeal

77
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,310
nerve, and the recurrent
laryngeal nerve.

78
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:20,830
The pharyngeal branch
is the first to

79
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:23,260
come off vagus and joins
with glossopharyngeal

80
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,370
to complete the
pharyngeal plexus.

81
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,650
Glossopharyngeal
provides the sensory

82
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:30,190
innervation, whereas the
pharyngeal branch provides

83
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,450
the motor to the three
pharyngeal constrictor

84
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:35,090
muscles. The
pharyngeal branch also

85
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,650
innervates all of the
muscles of the soft palate

86
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:40,730
except for tensor
velae palatini, which,

87
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:43,630
as we learned in video
2, receives innervation

88
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:46,910
from 5-3. The final
muscle innervated by

89
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:49,240
the pharyngeal branch
is the palatoglossus

90
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,390
muscle of the tongue.
The superior laryngeal

91
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:55,010
nerve is the next to
branch off vagus as it

92
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:58,410
descends the neck. This
nerve travels antero

93
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:01,350
-inferiorly to reach
the superior portion

94
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:04,590
of the larynx. As it
travels, it divides into

95
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:07,450
two smaller branches,
the internal and

96
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:10,990
external laryngeal nerves.
The internal laryngeal

97
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,830
nerve is the larger
of the two terminal

98
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:15,410
nerves. It is a sensory
nerve that provides

99
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:17,250
innervation for the
mucous membranes of the

100
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,290
laryngeal vestibule
and middle cavity,

101
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:22,630
including the vocal folds.
It will also send out

102
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,990
a branch to innervate
a small portion of the

103
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:27,690
tongue. The external
laryngeal nerve is

104
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:30,050
smaller than the internal
and is a strictly

105
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:33,250
motor nerve. It provides
motor innervation to

106
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,690
the inferior laryngeal
constrictor muscle

107
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:39,050
and sends another motor
branch to the cricothyroid

108
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:41,330
muscle of the larynx,
innervating it.

109
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:44,810
Note that cricothyroid
is the only

110
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:47,210
intrinsic laryngeal
muscle to be innervated

111
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:50,190
by the superior
laryngeal nerve. After

112
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,010
sending off the
superior laryngeal

113
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:54,350
nerve, vagus continues
to descend the neck

114
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,310
without sending any
further branches.

115
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,290
Once inside the thorax,
the vagus nerve sends

116
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:02,170
out one final branch
to the neck. This

117
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:05,010
branch loops back up
into the neck from the

118
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:08,190
thorax. It is the
recurrent laryngeal nerve.

119
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:10,390
Remember, the recurrent
laryngeal nerve

120
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:12,330
is asymmetrical
in where it loops

121
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:14,750
back. The left side
goes around the

122
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,610
arch of the aorta
near the ligamentum

123
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:18,990
arteriosum, whereas
the right side wraps

124
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:21,130
around the right
subclavian artery.

125
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:23,810
Both recurrent
laryngeal nerves travel

126
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:26,490
superiorly next to
the trachea in an area

127
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,970
called the
tracheoesophageal groove.

128
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,650
The recurrent
laryngeal nerves will

129
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:33,790
give off small
sensory branches along

130
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:35,690
the way, providing
sensory innervation

131
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:37,670
for the trachea
and esophagus.

132
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:40,730
The recurrent laryngeal
nerve ends when

133
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:43,130
it reaches the larynx.
Here, we change

134
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:46,030
the name to the inferior
laryngeal nerve.

135
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:49,210
The inferior laryngeal
nerve is the major

136
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:51,670
nerve supply for
the larynx. It has a

137
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:53,650
sensory component that
provides sensation

138
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:56,330
to the inferior
glottic cavity, and a

139
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,210
motor component that
handles all of the

140
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:00,650
other intrinsic
muscles of the larynx.

141
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,930
There are two branches
of the internal

142
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,830
laryngeal nerve. The
anterior branch supplies

143
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,850
most of our laryngeal
muscles, and the

144
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:11,210
posterior branch
supplies the remaining.

145
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:14,350
You will not be
asked to specifically

146
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:17,070
identify which branch
innervates which muscle.

147
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:20,070
Just remember that
the inferior laryngeal

148
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,330
nerve is the major
innovation for

149
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:24,870
these intrinsic
laryngeal muscles and

150
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:27,170
that cricothyroid is
the sole exception.

151
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:30,590
There are nine
pairs of laryngeal

152
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,330
muscles that move
the laryngeal

153
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:34,210
cartilages in
different ways.

154
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:37,830
Figure 9.39 from
Moore's offers a nice

155
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,770
summary of how these
muscles work. The

156
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:42,910
two most important
pieces of information

157
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:45,250
to learn at this
stage are that the

158
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,710
posterior cricoarytenoid
muscles are the

159
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:51,110
only muscles that
abduct the vocal folds

160
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,330
and that the cricothyroid
muscle is the

161
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,790
only intrinsic
laryngeal muscle not

162
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,530
innervated by the
inferior laryngeal nerve.

163
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,510
Lunachocorrelate
Damage to the recurrent

164
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:02,830
laryngeal nerve
happens during

165
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,830
surgical accidents
or as a consequence

166
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:07,310
of enlarged thyroid
tumors and aneurysms

167
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,390
of the aorta or
subclavian artery.

168
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:12,370
A lesion of the
recurrent laryngeal nerve

169
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:14,590
results in partial
or total paralysis

170
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:16,870
to most of the
intrinsic muscles of the

171
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,590
larynx. If the damage
is unilateral, the

172
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:21,070
patient will present
with what sounds

173
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:23,490
like a hoarse throat.
If the damage is

174
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:26,130
bilateral, then complete
mutinous results.

175
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,570
Bilateral paralysis
of the laryngeal

176
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:30,490
muscles leads to
difficulty breathing as

177
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:32,770
the vocal folds are
now not able to fully

178
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:35,370
abduct, resulting
in raspy breathing.

179
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,890
The next nerve that
we will look at is

180
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:41,030
cranial nerve 11, the
spinal accessory nerve.

181
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,390
Unlike the rest of the
cranial nerves, the

182
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,750
spinal accessory nerve
starts outside of

183
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:48,710
the skull within the
spine. Hence the name.

184
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,150
It begins as a
collection of rootlets

185
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,990
from the first five
to six cervical

186
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:55,650
segments of the spinal
cord. These rootlets

187
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:57,430
enter the skull
through the foramen

188
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:00,670
magnum. Once inside
the endocranium, the

189
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:02,470
fully formed nerve
will run together

190
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:05,750
with vagus as they both
exit the endocranium

191
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,490
and skull via the
jugular foramen.

192
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:10,590
From here, the spinal
accessory nerve

193
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:13,110
parts ways with vagus
and goes inferiorly,

194
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:15,310
paralleling the
internal carotid artery

195
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:17,370
before splitting
off to innervate the

196
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:19,930
sternocleidomastoid
and trapezius muscles.

197
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:23,230
These two muscles were
once a single, large

198
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,510
back muscle that can
still be seen in fish.

199
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:27,830
The evolution of
necks in land animals

200
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,730
required the head to
move separately from the

201
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:32,090
body, necessitating
the splitting of this

202
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:34,790
large back muscle into
two smaller muscles.

203
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:36,890
The shared innervation
from the spinal

204
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:39,210
accessory nerve is a
hallmark of that origin.

205
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:40,670
Clinical correlate.

206
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:42,590
Damage to the spinal
accessory nerve

207
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,330
is often the result
of an accident,

208
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:45,710
such as whiplash
from an automotive

209
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:47,770
collision or laceration
during surgery.

210
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:50,330
Lesions to the spinal
accessory nerve produce

211
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,430
weakness of the
trapezius, causing the

212
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,830
shoulders to droop
towards the affected side.

213
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:57,470
Spinal accessory lesions
can also occur during

214
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,530
childbirth if the
birthing process is

215
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:02,210
particularly difficult.
This results in

216
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:04,790
torticollis, or an abnormal
twisting of the neck,

217
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:07,170
caused by an entrapped
or shortening of the

218
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:09,930
sternocleidomastoid
muscle fibers. An acquired

219
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:12,410
form of torticollis,
known as spasmodic

220
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:15,090
torticollis, occurs
when a damaged cranial

221
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:17,730
nerve 11 becomes
hyperactive, causing the

222
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:20,190
sternocleidomastoid to
consistently contract.

223
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,750
In all of these
cases, the head will

224
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,690
tilt towards the
affected side

225
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:27,070
while the face
points away from it.

226
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:29,810
The final cranial
nerve in this series

227
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:32,790
is cranial nerve
12, the hypoglossal

228
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:35,370
nerve. This is the
chief motor supply

229
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:37,350
for most of the
muscles of the tongue.

230
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:39,550
Hypoglossal leaves
the brain near the

231
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:42,230
medulla and exits
the endocranium and

232
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:44,470
skull through the
hypoglossal canal.

233
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:47,430
After exiting the
skull, the hypoglossal

234
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:49,510
nerve initially
descends the neck before

235
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:52,290
changing direction
and moving anteriorly,

236
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:54,830
where it passes between
the internal carotid

237
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:57,270
artery and the
internal jugular vein.

238
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:00,210
As hypoglossal does
this, it picks up a

239
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:02,350
few hitchhikers from
the cervical plexus.

240
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,670
These nerve fibers
are conveyed to their

241
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,750
destination in the
superior root of ansa

242
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,190
cervicalis via the
hypoglossal nerve, despite

243
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:11,490
not actually being part
of the nerve itself.

244
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:14,150
Once hypoglossal
reaches the posterior

245
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:16,830
belly of digastric,
these hitchhiking nerve

246
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:20,150
fibers split off and
continue inferiorly

247
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:22,990
towards the
anticervicalis. At this

248
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,690
point, the hypoglossal
nerve changes

249
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,910
direction once more and
runs superiorly into

250
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,710
the base of the
tongue, where it fans

251
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:31,910
out to innervate all
of the tongue muscles,

252
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:34,360
with the exception
of palatoglossus.

253
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:37,650
Our tongue has
intrinsic muscles and

254
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:40,530
extrinsic muscles.
The intrinsic muscles

255
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:42,610
are hard to differentiate
in lab and are

256
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:44,830
deep within the
tongue. The comparisons

257
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:47,230
we care most about
are in regards to the

258
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:50,070
extrinsic muscles.
If the name ends in

259
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:52,990
glossus, it's an
extrinsic tongue muscle,

260
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,610
which means that
it attaches to the

261
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:56,810
tongue from somewhere
else on the body.

262
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:59,390
Genioglossus is the
large fan-shaped

263
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:00,950
muscle of the
tongue. It's the

264
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:02,790
most easily seen,
and it functions to

265
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,770
extend the tongue
from the mouth.

266
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:07,430
Hyoglossus does
the opposite,

267
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:09,550
retracting the tongue
and depressing it.

268
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:12,710
Styloglossus also
retracts the tongue,

269
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:14,330
but it will
elevate it as well.

270
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:17,130
So too will
palatoglossus.

271
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,690
Remember that
palatoglossus is the

272
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:21,550
only extrinsic
tongue muscle that

273
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,870
is not innervated
by hypoglossal.

274
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:26,770
Palatoglossus is
innervated by vagus.

275
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:29,330
The palate and tongue
are areas where

276
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,170
knowing which muscle
is innervated by

277
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:33,150
which nerve can get
a bit confusing.

278
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,930
To alleviate this,
Jack Stern from

279
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:37,710
Stony Brook University
came up with

280
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:39,790
a simple nesting
doll approach

281
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:42,250
that we now refer
to as Stern's Law.

282
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,690
The concept is
simple. If a muscle

283
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:47,950
has tensor in the
name, it is innervated

284
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:50,290
by cranial nerve
5-3, full stop.

285
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:53,450
If the muscle has
palate in the name, it

286
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,670
is innervated by
cranial nerve 10, unless

287
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:58,950
tensor is in the name
2. If the muscle has

288
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:00,990
glossus in the name,
it is innervated by

289
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:04,250
cranial nerve 12, unless
palate is present.

290
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,790
Each new rule
is superseded

291
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,070
by the rule before it.

292
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:10,110
Clinical correlate.

293
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,390
Damage to the hypoglossal
nerve presents

294
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:14,950
as weakness or paralysis
of tongue motions.

295
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:17,030
The geneoglossus
test is the

296
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,510
simplest way of
determining if

297
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:20,030
hypoglossal has
been damaged.

298
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:22,570
Geneoglossus is
a paired muscle,

299
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:24,470
and each side
receives innervation

300
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:26,610
from only one
hypoglossal nerve.

301
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,810
To test for a lesion
of the hypoglossal

302
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,850
nerve, patients are
asked to stick out

303
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,570
their tongue as
straight as they can,

304
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:34,730
activating their
genioglossus muscles.

305
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,700
If the nerve has
been damaged,

306
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,990
weakness or even
paralysis of

307
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:40,690
genioglossus will
cause the tongue to

308
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:42,810
deviate towards
the affected side.

309
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:45,150
We have just
learned about each

310
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,750
cranial nerve
in isolation.

311
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:47,850
However,

312
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:50,210
most head and neck
functions rely on

313
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:52,330
multiple cranial nerves
working in concert

314
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:54,430
with each other to
properly function.

315
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:59,010
let's briefly look at
two examples the gag

316
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:02,630
reflex this is a reflex
arc that keeps the

317
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:04,970
body from accidentally
ingesting an unexpected

318
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:07,670
food item it starts
when an unexpected

319
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,750
object comes into
contact with the back

320
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,550
of the pharynx this
triggers the afferent

321
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:15,070
limb of the gag reflex
which comes from the

322
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:17,610
glossopharyngeal nerve
in the pharyngeal

323
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:21,150
plexus glossopharyngeal
sends its afferent

324
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,470
signal back to a
specific nucleus in the

325
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,410
medulla, and this nucleus
communicates with an

326
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:29,210
adjacent nucleus that
sends a motor signal

327
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:32,210
via the vagus nerve,
triggering reverse

328
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:35,250
peristalsis, resulting
in the forceful expulsion

329
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:38,010
of the unexpected
object, or gagging.

330
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,570
Now, these are
the two big

331
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,390
nerves involved
with this reflex.

332
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:44,870
However, the reflex arc
may also incorporate

333
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:47,170
other nerves, such
as the mandibular

334
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:49,480
division of trigeminal
and hypoglossal,

335
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,750
opening the mouth and
lowering the tongue,

336
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,910
allowing for a
more efficient and

337
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:56,630
exaggerated expulsion
of the offending object.

338
00:13:57,890 --> 00:13:59,930
Sensitivity and
contributions to the gag

339
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:02,510
reflex vary from person
to person, but it

340
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:05,550
does remain consistent
for any one person.

341
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:08,490
The gag reflex may
also just be missing.

342
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:11,410
Around 37% of
individuals do not

343
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:13,910
show an appreciable
gag reflex.

344
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:17,110
So that's one
example of multiple

345
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:18,950
nerves functioning
together.

346
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,850
Let's do one
more. This one

347
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:22,410
is a bit more
complicated.

348
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:26,410
Proper swallowing
or deglutition

349
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:28,510
requires the
precise coordination

350
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:30,850
of multiple
cranial nerves.

351
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:34,010
Deglutition is a
three-stage process.

352
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:36,690
The first stage takes
that food bolus and

353
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:39,350
pushes it to the back
of the mouth. This

354
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:41,010
is practically all
performed by our

355
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:43,670
tongue. The tongue
pushes and moves the food

356
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:46,090
item from the hard
to the soft palate,

357
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:48,030
bringing it to the
back of the throat.

358
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:51,270
This is a hypoglossal
dominant action.

359
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:55,010
The second stage is
the most complex.

360
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:58,150
Here we are taking
that food bolus and

361
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:01,330
dropping it into the
pharynx. To do this,

362
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:03,210
we need to get the
soft palate out of

363
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:05,570
the way. This is
accomplished via the

364
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:08,030
coordinated action
between the vagus nerve

365
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:10,170
and the mandibular
branch of trigeminal

366
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:12,730
via the nerve to
tensor velli palatini.

367
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:15,570
With the soft palate
out of the way, we

368
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:18,230
now have to widen
the pharynx. This is

369
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,850
done by activating
the longitudinal

370
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:22,680
muscles of the pharynx,
stylopharyngeus,

371
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:25,650
salpingopharyngeus,
and palatopharyngeus.

372
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:28,970
This requires activation
of our glossopharyngeal

373
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:32,210
and vagus nerves. As
these muscles lift

374
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:35,070
the larynx superiorly,
the epiglottis is

375
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:38,010
pushed closed over the
glottis, shutting off

376
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:40,050
our airway and preventing
us from choking.

377
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:43,010
The food can now
fall into the throat.

378
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:47,070
Our final stage
of deglutition is

379
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:48,730
the rhythmic
contraction of our

380
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:51,510
pharyngeal constrictors
as they push the

381
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:53,690
food bolus down
into the esophagus.

382
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:56,790
This peristaltic
action is done via

383
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,130
innervation from the
vagus nerve again.

384
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,970
So to summarize,

385
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:05,490
stage 1 is
hypoglossal dominant.

386
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:07,770
Stage 2, that's
the complicated

387
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,930
one. It involves
trigeminal,

388
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:12,350
glossopharyngeal,
and vagus.

389
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:15,830
Stage 3, that's
vagus dominant.

390
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:19,410
All these nerves must
function properly

391
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:21,290
for rhythmic
swallowing to occur.

392
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:23,670
The misfiring of
one or more of these

393
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:25,650
nerves produces
dysphagia, or

394
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:28,030
trouble swallowing,
as we can see here.

395
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,190
And with that,
we come to the

396
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:34,270
end of this video
lecture series.
