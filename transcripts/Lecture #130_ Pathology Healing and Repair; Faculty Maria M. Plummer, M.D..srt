1
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:09,380
Hello, this is Dr.
Plummer, and we are going

2
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:12,360
to do healing and
repair in this session,

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,800
which kind of comes
in sequence with the

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:20,580
cell injury and death
and inflammation.

5
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,440
It's kind of like
the next step,

6
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,230
but again, this
is all a spectrum.

7
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,520
These are the session
objectives, which

8
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:31,830
should be the same
as in your CPG, and

9
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,540
this is an overall
chart that just shows

10
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,680
basically what we're
going to talk about.

11
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,100
There's an injury,
we've discussed

12
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,120
that before,
and we have a

13
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,120
cellular and
vessel response.

14
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,040
And we can go
different pathways.

15
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,740
We can remove the
stimulus because

16
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,820
if it's an acute
injury, and we can

17
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,180
regenerate the
normal structure.

18
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:57,500
Or if it's a deep
wound with more tissue

19
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,780
damage, you can do
healing with scar.

20
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:03,120
Persistent tissue
damage would definitely

21
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,980
end up in tissue
scar, fibrosis like

22
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,600
you see in certain
diseases like

23
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,060
chronic pancreatitis.
So we're going to go

24
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,720
through injury and
see how this all

25
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,080
fits in with what
we've learned so far.

26
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,860
So when we talk about
repair of tissue we

27
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,580
mean that the tissue
architecture has to be

28
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,020
restored and its
function not just this

29
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:28,720
architecture after some
kind of injury and that

30
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,740
comes from proliferating
proliferation of the

31
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:35,440
remnants of the injured
tissue and endothelial

32
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,400
cells and fibroblasts
these are main tissue

33
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,140
but they're not the
only main cells when

34
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,840
we regenerate we restore
normal cells when we

35
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,020
lay down scar formation
we're talking about

36
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,600
more like collagen
deposition which we'll

37
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,520
get to uh when you have
extracellular matrix

38
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,660
framework damage,
especially extensively, you

39
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:59,880
cannot have regeneration.
You must have scar

40
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,180
formation because you
need that scaffold.

41
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,000
Pure repair with
scar usually occurs

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,540
in tissues that do
not regenerate and

43
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:09,580
we're going to talk
about what that

44
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:12,540
means. Permanent
tissue is that type

45
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,040
and there's other
types of tissue.

46
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,780
So regeneration, as
I just said, and I do

47
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:21,880
repeat myself for
points of emphasis is

48
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,880
the replacement of
damaged or dead cells

49
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,220
and or tissue by cells
of the same type and

50
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,640
that can happen by
proliferation of

51
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,940
differentiated cells that
to survive the injury

52
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,740
and an example that
would be in liver

53
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:37,760
and they have the
capacity to proliferate.

54
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,620
It also can happen
when tissue stem cells

55
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,520
and their progenitors
will contribute to

56
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,280
restoring damaged
tissue. And regeneration

57
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,840
really occurs with
tissues which are highly

58
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,440
proliferative. And
the important point

59
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,540
is that the basement
membrane must remain

60
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:58,320
intact and the immature
cells, the stem

61
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,720
cells, must remain
intact. And, very

62
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,840
importantly, there must
be an intact connective

63
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,360
tissue scaffold or
you cannot regenerate.

64
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,460
I've been talking a
lot about different

65
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:13,120
cells so let's just
define them. The labile

66
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,100
cells are those that
renew their cellular

67
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,380
populations. They
continuously divide.

68
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,780
Examples include
things like skin

69
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:24,300
and lymphoid tissue,
the bone marrow,

70
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,000
GI mucosa. And think
about that when

71
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,720
someone unfortunately
receives chemotherapy.

72
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,650
Those are the ones
that are affected. The

73
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,520
epithelial cells, the
hair, there's hair

74
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,240
loss. There's usually
a suppression of

75
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,730
the bone marrow. There's
usually vomiting,

76
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,600
diarrhea maybe, and
that's because of

77
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,840
the GI mucosa. So
that makes sense.

78
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,800
Then there are
stable cells, which

79
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,320
really they can
proliferate, but they have

80
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,760
a very low rate generally
of proliferating,

81
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:56,060
or they just
don't proliferate.

82
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:01,280
But they can, when
stimulated, reenter the

83
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,640
cell cycle. So they're
considered quiescent.

84
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,020
Examples of this are
so many different

85
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,440
cells. these are
just examples like

86
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,980
the liver, kidney,
smooth muscle,

87
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,080
parenchymal
cells mean the

88
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,420
cells of an organ
basically, and

89
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,880
all these cells
listed here.

90
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,160
And permanent cells
are terminally

91
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,180
differentiated. They're
non-dividing. They can no

92
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:24,000
longer regenerate.
Now traditionally the

93
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,780
examples given are
nerve tissue, cardiac

94
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:29,200
muscle, and skeletal
muscle. And nowadays they

95
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,340
have learned how to
regenerate some nerve

96
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,060
tissue and skeletal
muscle. And there is

97
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,240
some regeneration
going on. But for our

98
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,040
intents and purposes for
this particular lecture

99
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,440
we're going to say
that these three types

100
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,320
of cells are basically
permanent cells.

101
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,100
Now we I think we
discussed growth factors

102
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,140
but and you've heard
it before but these are

103
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,120
very important proteins
and they regulate

104
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,840
a lot of different
things. One of the things

105
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,620
they regulate is growth
and the important

106
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,840
source includes
macrophages but they can

107
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,660
come from other things
like epithelial cells

108
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:04,280
or stromal cells they're
kind of bought they

109
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,360
bind to specific
receptors and then they

110
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,440
have they signal the
target cells and this

111
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,980
is all very you know
cellular kind of science

112
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:16,480
here medicine the
signals will then

113
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:20,660
stimulate gene transcription
that in resting cells

114
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:23,210
is silent but then
it stimulates it and

115
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:26,320
it includes genes that
control the cell cycle

116
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:31,560
so there are a lot of
growth factors. And

117
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,200
right here, I'm
mentioning four of what I

118
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,520
think are the most
important. There are many

119
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,200
more. You'll hear
about a lot more, but

120
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,420
these four I would like
you to kind of know.

121
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,720
PDGF is platelet-derived
growth factor. And

122
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,580
one of the things it
does, it does a lot

123
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,540
of things, but it
causes migration and

124
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,860
proliferation of fibroblasts
and smooth muscle

125
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:55,850
cells and also monocytes
to inflammatory

126
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:59,120
areas. And it helps with
healing skin wounds.

127
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:02,500
VEGF, vascular
endothelial growth, is

128
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,020
extremely important
in angiogenesis, which

129
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:08,580
is also called
neovascularization, which

130
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:11,620
is new blood vessel
formation. And it's

131
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:14,300
what is important in
chronic inflammation

132
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,900
and healing, which is
why we're discussing

133
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,020
even in tumors. Tumors
can't grow without

134
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:22,660
a blood supply. So
they use VEGF to

135
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,900
produce more vessels
so they can survive.

136
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:28,680
and we do now trying
to there are some

137
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,040
therapies that are
anti-VEGF I don't I I'm

138
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,440
not a pharmacologist
so I don't know how I

139
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,040
don't know how well
they work some of them

140
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,520
do work some of
them don't work but

141
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:44,180
doctors Pino and Goldstein
may know more Dr.

142
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:50,680
Dosha Osa now factor
growth factor 2 and

143
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,160
you don't have to
remember that it's two.

144
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,600
Somebody may want you
to, but I just care

145
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,570
that it's FGF. It
happens to help re

146
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:59,940
-epithelialization of skin
wounds and also helps

147
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,900
with new blood
formation, etc. is there

148
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,680
because it does so
many different things.

149
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,340
There's really a lot
of things it does.

150
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:10,080
Tumor growth, tissue
growth factor beta is

151
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,380
very important
because it's extremely

152
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:16,400
powerful fibrogenic
agent. It will stimulate

153
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,660
collagen and enhances
the production of

154
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,900
collagen and it also
inhibits that collagen

155
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,960
should be degraded and
it's anti-inflammatory

156
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,740
now these are just a
list of some growth

157
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:31,500
factors please do not
memorize this one you

158
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,820
know someday you'll
have to go through

159
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,980
these all at some point
I don't require you

160
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:37,720
to memorize all this
before that I mentioned

161
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,460
are in bold for you
to look at because

162
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,300
those are what I think
are the most important

163
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,100
but that's from my
point of view but all

164
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,940
growth factors are
important and there are

165
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:48,210
many of them and this
is a limited list.

166
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:52,200
So when we want to
heal a wound because of

167
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,920
injury there are three
phases and we already

168
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,740
discussed the first
one inflammatory

169
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:00,580
phase where you have an
injury the coagulation

170
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:04,660
cascade gets
instigated there's some

171
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:08,640
platelet aggregation
and PDGF gets released

172
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,340
and there is the
vasodilation and all those

173
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,890
things we talked about
the migration the

174
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:15,580
rolling all that stuff
I'm not saying it

175
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,900
in order but that's
the acute and chronic

176
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,440
inflammatory response
so we're not really

177
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,880
going to discuss
that that was already

178
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,320
discussed what we're
going to talk about is

179
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,520
the proliferation phase
and maturation phase

180
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,640
and important things
include in the

181
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,960
proliferation phase something
known as granulation

182
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,380
tissue and we're
going to talk about

183
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:34,240
that it's very important
and of course scar

184
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,200
tissue which is in
the maturation phase.

185
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:43,480
So when we repair things
by scar connective

186
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,920
tissue because it's
basically fibrosis you

187
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,800
know we go through
inflammation first

188
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:52,020
angiogenesis new blood
vessels fibroblasts come

189
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,260
in and proliferate
and they form a scar

190
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,920
and this is very important
and the prototype

191
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:00,660
of this a good example
is skin and we're

192
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,420
going to go through
that in a little bit

193
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:06,340
but most healing is
not either regeneration

194
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:09,160
or repair but kind of
a combination of both

195
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,640
and it really depends
on the kind of injury

196
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,740
the ability of the
tissue cells to

197
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:18,200
regenerate or proliferate
how the extracellular

198
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,100
matrix is damaged the
integrity of it if

199
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,940
the scaffold is there
that's good and any

200
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:28,280
chronic inflammation
that's hanging out so

201
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,880
let me talk about
granulation tissue, which

202
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,500
is one of the most
important concepts,

203
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,940
especially if you're
going to go into surgery.

204
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,980
This is when you
have the migration

205
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,480
and proliferation
of fibroblasts.

206
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,500
And there's deposition
of connective

207
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,620
tissue, which
is kind of loose

208
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,580
in the beginning,
and new vessels.

209
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,100
And those new vessels,
that's known as

210
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,620
androgenesis. And the
white cells in this

211
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,700
phase are usually
mostly macrophages.

212
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,620
When you first
start, graduation

213
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:57,100
tissue, the type
3 collagen is what

214
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,580
is first
synthesized. That's

215
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,910
immature. That's
non-mature collagen.

216
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,300
And of course, all
these interactions

217
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,260
take place through
growth factors. And the

218
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,080
extracellular matrix,
which I'm going

219
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,060
to talk a little bit
about, but is more

220
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:13,100
of a cellular pathology
thing, but not

221
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,440
really a pathology
pathology, are things

222
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,500
like glycoproteins
and proteoglycans.

223
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,400
And you need the
glycoproteins to cross-link

224
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,260
the collagen fibers
to make them strong.

225
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,340
That's one of the
things they do. and you

226
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:28,040
need proteoglycans for
hydrating that ECM,

227
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,340
that gel formation. So
this is a picture of

228
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,480
granulation tissue
or angiogenesis. The

229
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,920
endothelial cells, the
lining of the vessels

230
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,260
will grow extensions
toward the wound site

231
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,680
and the extensions are
called pseudopodia.

232
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,220
The cells will
divide and then they

233
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,520
create a new lumen and
the main control of

234
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,800
this is VEGFA. You
know, I don't need

235
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,980
you to talk, you
know, know necessarily

236
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,620
that it's A. I
mean, that's in the

237
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,160
book. But the important
thing to remember

238
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,400
is vascular endothelial
growth factor.

239
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,560
Again, I'm going
through these four

240
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,350
again because I think
they're important.

241
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,540
The EGF, most
important growth

242
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,360
factor, especially
in wound healing.

243
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,340
And it promotes
vasodilation, stimulates

244
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,540
production of nitric
oxide. Remember,

245
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,320
that's a vasodilator
like histamine. And

246
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,240
also vessel permeability
increased. And we

247
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,460
went through some of
this in inflammation

248
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:27,220
and also in cellular
injury and death.

249
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,790
VEGF-A, which is,
I guess, a subtype,

250
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,260
is the most important
in angiogenesis

251
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,680
because of its
ability to proliferate

252
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,600
and move endothelial
cells. And we'll

253
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,190
talk a little bit
more about that.

254
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,140
I would never ask you
a question saying,

255
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:43,560
you know, giving you
two choices in that,

256
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,240
like VEGF and VEGF
-A. I won't do that.

257
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:50,000
just so you know the
VEGFA is more specific

258
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,020
and and it's really
very important in

259
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,380
angiogenesis and I
already talked about FGF

260
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:58,240
promoting migration of
macrophages and fibroblasts

261
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,620
and remember that
newly formed vessels

262
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:06,580
in a wound or anywhere
are very fragile and

263
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:09,020
they need to be
stabilized and that means

264
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,980
they're going to be
recruiting what are known

265
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,800
as parasites and
smooth muscle cells and

266
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,060
ECM proteins will be
deposited and the kind

267
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,860
of things that help
regulate that are the

268
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:22,020
ones listed here like
angiopoietin 1 and 2

269
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:26,920
etc PDGF TGF beta and
they help stabilize.

270
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:31,940
Okay so this is a picture
of some angiogenesis

271
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:34,340
new blood vessel
developing from an

272
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:37,640
existing blood vessel
and the parasites which

273
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,620
are not parasite
parasite it's my Jersey

274
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:45,280
accent are on at the
edge of the vessel as

275
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,580
you can see here in
the picture and they're

276
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,660
on the abluminal
surface which means the

277
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:52,080
opposite of the lumen
they break down the

278
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,830
basement membrane and
they form a little sprout

279
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:57,740
as you see in the
picture here and then

280
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:00,640
the endothelial cells
will migrate towards

281
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:05,630
the tissue injury by
being stimulated and then

282
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:08,720
the endothelial
cells proliferate and

283
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,920
mature and periendothelial
cells, more parasites,

284
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,840
more smooth muscle
cells are recruited

285
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,980
to form mature vessels.
And down here is

286
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:21,600
just basically the
caption for this picture.

287
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,100
You're seeing angiogenesis
by the sprouting

288
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,580
of a new vessel,
formation of new vessel.

289
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,500
Okay, so now we need
to worry about the

290
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,460
connective tissue. and
that is going to be

291
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,800
mostly collagen although
there are things in it

292
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,420
and you're going to
need fibroblasts to

293
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:42,040
migrate to the area and
to proliferate and the

294
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,240
fibroblasts don't
just secrete collagen

295
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,960
or make collagen but
they deposit ECM proteins

296
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:52,140
this is all orchestrated
by growth factors

297
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,620
cytokines like the
ones I've already

298
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:56,620
mentioned and the most
time the sources of that

299
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,920
are macrophages that
although they can come

300
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,820
from other sources
like in the field of

301
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:04,560
epithelial cells, but
mostly M2 macrophages.

302
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,580
So we already talked
about the acute

303
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:10,220
injury and 24 hours
and the neutrophils

304
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,560
coming, but when you
get to the 48-hour

305
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,680
mark, the more
dominant cell is the

306
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,660
macrophage. And again,
it doesn't mean that

307
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,060
all the neutrophils
disappear and

308
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,340
macrophages show up.
It's a process, and

309
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,160
you'll see that in a
graph I have later.

310
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,460
What's controlling
the fibroblasts

311
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:28,820
are mostly
macrophages, and the

312
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,340
migration is done
by different types

313
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,740
of chemokines,
growth factors, etc.

314
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,120
And again, I want
to reiterate that

315
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,420
TGF-beta is very
important in making

316
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,420
fibrous tissue,
fibrinogenesis.

317
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:44,760
Fibroblasts will
create the matrix of

318
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,580
type 3 collagen,
which is the immature

319
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:49,740
one, and fibronectin.
And that at first,

320
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,240
like I said, was
immature, and it

321
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,680
has only about a 10
% tensile strength.

322
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,560
When collagen,

323
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,080
type 1 collagen,
which is mature,

324
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,020
replaces everything,
when you have full

325
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,580
scar tissue, it
says here three

326
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,080
months. It could be
two months, three

327
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,160
months. Again, it's
not a perfect number.

328
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,020
Your tensile strength
is about 70% to

329
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,980
80% of what it
originally was. It

330
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:13,860
doesn't really return
to 100% in scars.

331
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,940
The extracellular
matrix, which

332
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,960
you've heard about,
is important because

333
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,180
it's what is the
mechanical support

334
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,620
for cells. and
it's important in

335
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,500
anchoring the cells
and migration.

336
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,500
It controls cell
growth because

337
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,340
it regulates cell
proliferation

338
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:30,180
by signaling
via receptors,

339
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,980
especially the
endocrine family.

340
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,320
And it is the scaffold,
that's important,

341
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,340
a scaffold for
tissue renewal,

342
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,700
okay? If you
destroy a lot of it,

343
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,630
you're not gonna be
able to regenerate.

344
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,600
Establishment of a
tissue microenvironment

345
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,590
is very important, and
that's what ECM does.

346
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:52,280
the basement membrane
is what's between the

347
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,280
epithelium and the
underlying connective

348
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,080
tissue. So you want
to keep that intact if

349
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:00,500
you want to have
epithelialization or else

350
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,500
you're going to have
a really big scar.

351
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,880
I'm not going to really
go on and on about

352
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,230
the ECM. I think you
have other recordings

353
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:10,980
and lectures about
this. Just realize that

354
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,260
there are two forms,
interstitial matrix and

355
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:17,300
basement membrane and
that this is a picture

356
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:20,080
from Robbins I believe
showing you know the

357
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,520
basement membrane which
contains by the way

358
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,920
the laminin or type
and type 4 collagen

359
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,560
which is kind of
important for the basement

360
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,820
membrane and it just
shows you where everything

361
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:32,380
is and you know it's
one big scaffold

362
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:35,440
basically and the
epithelium sits on top those

363
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,780
cells on blue cells
on top okay so there's

364
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:43,180
collagens and elastic
fibers in the extracellular

365
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,380
matrix which give
you that strength.

366
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:48,740
Adhesive glycoproteins
I had mentioned earlier

367
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:51,980
and that's important
to connect the

368
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:56,440
elements and to each
other and proteoglycans

369
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,100
which helps with
lubrication and resilience.

370
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,920
Now please don't
memorize the formation of

371
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,840
collagen for me. Somebody
else may want you

372
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,640
but I'm not going
to ask you about the

373
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,900
formation of collagen
but you do need to know

374
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,880
that collagen is laid
down by fibroblast, and

375
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,820
that's in the proliferative
phase of repair

376
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:16,880
and modified in the
maturation phase. And

377
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,840
collagen itself is
made up of three alpha

378
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,200
chains that form a
triple helix. That's kind

379
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:26,090
of important. So when we
go from pre-procollagen

380
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:28,540
to pro-collagen to
collagen, and again,

381
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,270
I'm not going to
ask you about that

382
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:31,880
biochemistry, although
you may need to know it

383
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,540
for somebody else, there's
a lot of modification,

384
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:38,240
and you need vitamin
C, which kind of

385
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,300
explains why scurvy
happens. If you don't

386
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:43,060
have enough vitamin
C, you will have skin

387
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:47,160
issues because you don't
have mature collagen

388
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,320
and the collagen is
not produced correctly.

389
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:53,220
So there, just so you
know, there are many

390
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,380
types of collagen. And
again, please do not

391
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:59,280
memorize one through
whatever this is, 13,

392
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,040
16, whatever. There
are a lot. And with

393
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,720
each one, there is a
disease associated with

394
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,150
it. And we're not going
to talk about these

395
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,780
diseases now, but I
just want you to realize

396
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,780
how important collagen
is and how many

397
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,680
diseases it could form.
Now, some of these

398
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,440
are extremely rare.
I've never seen, but we

399
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,700
have an Erlos-Danlos
clinic here at NYIT

400
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,440
-COM. So you see how
important that is for in

401
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,220
a, for collagen three
and five especially.

402
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,980
And there are other
things that we'll talk

403
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:31,860
about in bone, osteogenic
genesis imperfecta,

404
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,940
and also Erlos Danlos.
There are four,

405
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,200
the four bean types that
you want to remember

406
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,820
are the ones that
I've listed, but type

407
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,580
one and three are
really, really, really

408
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,280
important, which is
why they're in red. So

409
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,900
type one is the mature
collagen. It's very

410
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,900
high tensile strength.
We're talking about

411
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,320
tendons, bones, and
scars. It's mature.

412
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:52,880
Type three is immature.
This is the first

413
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,960
collagen that is
deposited in wound

414
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,280
healing. so it's not
as tensile it's not

415
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,190
as strong and then
two is mostly in

416
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:01,920
cartilage and other
things like the vitreous

417
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,880
humor and four i
mentioned is associated

418
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,320
with laminin in the
basement membrane

419
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,080
again i don't want you
to memorize this slide

420
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,920
either but these are
just some examples of

421
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,660
glycoproteins and
proteoglycans and what

422
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:19,420
they do this is more
biochemistry but i want

423
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,420
you to realize if i
say the word you know

424
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:24,080
fibronectin that you
know i'm talking about

425
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,380
something in the
extracellular matrix okay and

426
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,670
we've talked about
integrins as well so

427
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:33,130
just this is more of a
slide for supplemental

428
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,040
information I don't
need it I know you're

429
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:40,060
gonna probably study
this in another session

430
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:44,160
so this is a really
good explanation of a

431
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,280
skin injury a cutaneous
injury the three phases

432
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,240
you have the inflammation
which we have

433
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,080
discussed that's phase
one then the proliferation

434
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,160
and then the maturation
and as you can

435
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,360
see and what i'm trying
to emphasize here are

436
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,700
they they're really an
artificial construct

437
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,720
this is a spectrum it's
a dynamic overlapping

438
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,480
process it's not
like all of a sudden

439
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,500
the inflammation disappears
and then the next

440
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,900
step happens no this is
all kind of happening

441
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,380
along a spectrum and
you can see that in

442
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:13,460
the chart that's attached
so these are this

443
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,540
is a chart again a
little smaller but down

444
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,160
on the bottom that's
kind of important because

445
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,960
if you remember i
told you you know the

446
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,120
neutrophils come in
first and the macrophages

447
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,300
come in last I mean,
not last, I'm sorry,

448
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,560
second, around 48 hours,
around two days, but

449
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,020
it's not like all the
neutrophils disappear.

450
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,440
They go down. They're
still there at like

451
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,820
four days, but it's
the macrophages that

452
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,800
are predominant. The
fibroblasts come in, all

453
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,680
these things, again,
there's an overlap. So,

454
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,340
but if I tell you
something is 48 hours,

455
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,990
what's the dominant
cell? The answer is

456
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:46,120
macrophages. Yeah,
neutrophils are there, but

457
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,800
they're not the dominant
cell at 48 or two days

458
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:54,200
to 96 to three days
or four days so the

459
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,660
immediate thing that
happens is within two to

460
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,620
four days you get the
formation of clot when

461
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,420
you have an injury we
talked a little bit

462
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:03,040
about cell damage and
bacteria acute inflammation

463
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:06,540
we discussed vasodilation
and phagocytosis

464
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:09,040
and the neutrophils
that come in within

465
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:12,400
24 hours and peak
about then or a little

466
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,730
bit later i mean again
it's not a perfect number

467
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:17,620
and it may vary from
person to person but

468
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,780
then after the
neutrophils start falling,

469
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:22,060
you will get the influx
of the macrophages.

470
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,960
So in phase two, we're
talking about two

471
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,160
days to three weeks.
Again, these are artificial

472
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,900
kind of phases. You
know, I'm just trying

473
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,040
to make it a little
simpler. And again,

474
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,440
you have a little
graph on top. And what

475
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,340
you see is the
development of granulation

476
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:42,220
tissue, very important,
in which fibroblasts

477
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,840
come in to lay down
collagen and in which

478
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,620
angiogenesis occurs,
the development of new

479
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,460
blood vessels. What
you see on the bottom

480
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:53,420
is granulation tissue
on the left you see a

481
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:55,840
lot of red and all that
red is blood vessels

482
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,360
and there's some loose
connective tissue

483
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,740
in there on the right
is a special stain and

484
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:03,540
it's a special stain
for collagen or for

485
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,580
fibroblast or fibrous
tissue and it's

486
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,720
blue it because
that's what it stains

487
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,540
fibrous tissue so
the vessels are still

488
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:13,340
there but as you
can tell the fibrous

489
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,900
tissue is starting to
develop here as you

490
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,720
go later and later
into angiogenesis

491
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,820
so phase three is the
maturation and that's

492
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,640
when type three
collagen is replaced by

493
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,060
type one so you get
your tensile strength

494
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:30,340
about 70 to 80 percent
you need to remodel make

495
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,720
sure that the scar
the scar tissue is not

496
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,880
does not have vessels
it's avascular and

497
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,320
acellular and sometimes
if the wound is big

498
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,460
enough like in this
case unfortunately

499
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:43,760
there's wound contraction
the wound edges pull

500
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,540
together and they do
so to close the defect

501
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:49,160
via myofibroblasts.
And these are basically

502
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,320
fibroblasts that have
muscle filaments.

503
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:55,880
Okay, combination of
regeneration repair

504
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,840
and the best example of
that is a skin wound.

505
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,360
That's what's classically
taught. There's

506
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,980
first intention and
second intention.

507
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:06,100
Healing by first intention
or primary union is

508
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,180
basically the
regeneration of the skin,

509
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:11,220
the epithelium. And
when the injury only

510
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,220
involves the epithelial
layer, you get first

511
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,860
intention healing. So
an example would be a

512
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:19,820
nice clean linear
surgical excision because

513
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:22,320
you have really a
limited number of skin

514
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,900
cells that die and
even connective tissue.

515
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,880
The second intention
healing is when you have

516
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,960
a really big area
wound a gapping hole

517
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,540
basically when you have
a lot of tissue loss.

518
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:37,960
They are not easily
aligned together the

519
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,880
epithelial cells and
there's a much more intense

520
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,780
inflammatory reaction
and a lot of granulation

521
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:46,100
tissue, which I
showed you before a

522
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,560
picture of. And then you
get a lot of collagen.

523
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,120
So you're going to get
quite a large scar.

524
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:54,120
So here's a
beautiful picture of

525
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,980
healing by first
intention or

526
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:58,800
primary union.
This is a surgical

527
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,100
incision.

528
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:03,080
You will get some
inflammation, but not as

529
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,860
bad as when it's secondary
healing, a secondary

530
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:09,000
intention and this
happens again the wounds

531
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,700
are very they have
opposed edges they can

532
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,820
be easily brought
together and it involves

533
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,840
only the epithelial
layer and so this is an

534
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,940
example of that with
the surgical sutures.

535
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:22,700
Healing by secondary
intention is most

536
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,720
other things where
you have basically

537
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,580
you know a big
wound and a lot of

538
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:31,920
extensive cell loss
and tissue loss and the

539
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,260
edges are not able
to come together.

540
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,140
They're separated,
like in this case.

541
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,740
In this case, regeneration
of the cells can't

542
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,100
completely restore the
original architecture.

543
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:46,200
So granulation tissue
has to grow from

544
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,280
the margin and help
complete the repair. So

545
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:52,040
granulation tissue is
very, very important.

546
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:56,120
Here's another example
side-by-side of first

547
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:59,020
and second intention
healing. as you can

548
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:01,860
tell in this cartoon
on the left in the

549
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:04,460
first intention healing
the wound is minor

550
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:06,910
it's minor and there's
a lot less injury

551
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,280
there's a lot less
destruction of tissue whereas

552
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,020
on the right the second
intention there's

553
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:17,290
a big wound here
and look at all this

554
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:20,130
angiogenesis and over
here on the right middle

555
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:22,260
a lot more blood
vessels than you see

556
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,620
over here in the first
intention and that's

557
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,720
around again three to
seven days is around

558
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,100
the time this granulation
tissue is coming

559
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,640
and weeks later the
epithelium and a scar

560
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,760
nice nice healing and
whereas where you get a

561
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,260
really bad scar you
need to have wound the

562
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:42,400
contraction of the wound
and etc so the wound

563
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,760
contraction occurs
in really big surface

564
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:48,100
wounds that are going to
be healing by secondary

565
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,700
intention we're talking
about skin wounds

566
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:53,240
here and what it does
is helps close the

567
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,880
gap between the edges
of the skin and the

568
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,920
dermis and reduces the
surface area of the

569
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,360
wound and I mentioned
the myofibroblast before

570
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,420
so I'm repeating myself
like I often do and

571
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:07,880
again remember that
myofibroblasts contain

572
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,980
characteristics
of both muscle

573
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,560
cells and fibrous
tissue and

574
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,560
they help
contract the wound

575
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:18,000
again via growth
factors like listed here

576
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,080
that are usually released
mostly by macrophages

577
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,720
only by macrophages
no but mostly by

578
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:27,320
macrophages okay so
now when you have a big

579
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,300
wound and you have
to remodel it uh the

580
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:33,060
granulation tissue is
replaced by scar and this

581
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:35,520
is going to involve changes
in the extracellular

582
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,060
matrix and there's
going to you're

583
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,980
going to have to rely on
a sin the body's going

584
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:42,000
to have to rely on
between the synthesis

585
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,460
and degradation of
extracellular proteins.

586
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:47,560
And that's where matrix
metalloproteinases

587
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:50,900
come in. There are
enzymes which degrade

588
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:55,400
and they're very
important in this balance.

589
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,940
These matrix
metalloproteinases are here

590
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:00,960
about again. They're
produced by a lot of

591
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,860
different cells as listed
and they are made and

592
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:07,960
secreted and regulated
by growth factors and

593
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,740
cytokines, etc. So
here's some examples

594
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:13,260
that are listed underneath.
Again, I don't need

595
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,540
you to memorize that
interstitial collagenases,

596
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,600
cleave, fibrillary
collagen. I just

597
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,920
want you to understand
there's many different

598
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,680
ones. And what stops
this from happening?

599
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:25,720
What's the balance
between degradation and

600
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,060
synthesis? Well,
there's something called

601
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:30,160
tissue inhibitors of
metalloprotonases, and

602
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:33,920
they're what shut down
the metalloprotonases

603
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:37,200
so that they don't
continue to degrade again

604
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,000
we discussed this the
tensile strength of

605
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,560
the wound depends on
the amount of collagen

606
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:45,880
and also you want the
the degradation to

607
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,140
decrease right so by
the again i'm repeating

608
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:50,220
myself end of first
week wound strength is

609
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:53,500
about 10 percent in the
unwounded skin and after

610
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,400
a few months two to
three it plateaus at

611
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:00,180
about 70 to 80 percent
so this is another

612
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,880
overview picture where
you have a persistent

613
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,000
stimulus like chronic
inflammation that is

614
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,900
activating things like
macrophages which act

615
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,840
you know goes ahead
and produces growth

616
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:13,140
factors cytokines and
decreases metallic proteinase

617
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:16,000
activity and that
all leads basically

618
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,980
to increase collagen
synthesis from the

619
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:22,300
fibroblast etc and decrease
collagen degradation

620
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:25,500
and you get fibrosis
and fibrosis is just

621
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:29,580
basically scar scarring
now i'm going to talk

622
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,500
about this one slide
talks about regeneration

623
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,500
of the liver i'm not
i'm i just feel you

624
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,100
don't you can't graduate
from medical school

625
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,240
without knowing a
little bit about the

626
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,220
liver is a little bit
different than a lot of

627
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:42,200
organs because it can
regenerate it's really

628
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,320
kind of strange but
you can do 60 percent

629
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,020
hepectomy hepatectomy
i'm sorry the

630
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:51,320
liver um and you
will get liver back

631
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,700
and the tissue back
and mechanism is

632
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,880
the proliferation of
what remains behind

633
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,080
the remaining liver
cells and also

634
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,480
repopulation from
progenitor cells.

635
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:05,000
So this is means that
the hepatocytes you

636
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,880
know they they divide
and they have a

637
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,380
proliferative capacity
but sometimes they're

638
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:13,340
impaired this capacity
especially in like

639
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:15,820
alcoholic liver disease
and things like that.

640
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:19,720
I want just to emphasize
the regeneration of

641
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:22,200
liver is not just
regrowth of the lobes you

642
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,120
know but it does occur
in phases listed here

643
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,640
primary where the
liver cells are again

644
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,760
primed by cytokines which
are made by macrophages

645
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,700
and in the liver when
we talk about the

646
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,600
liver the macrophages
are called cuffer cells

647
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,600
again they like to call
macrophages different

648
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,000
things in different
tissue and there's a

649
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,180
growth factor phase
and a termination phase

650
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:46,000
i'm just mentioning
this i want you to put

651
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,700
this in the back of your
head but this is the

652
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,860
liver is a little bit
different than what

653
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,660
we've been talking about
wounds of the skin.

654
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:54,680
Now what is going
to get in the way

655
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:57,300
of healing okay of
a wound and again

656
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,600
this is very
important in surgery.

657
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,160
An infection okay a
local infection that's

658
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,540
why sterile technique
is so important. If

659
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:09,260
you get pro-inflammatory
cytokines and tissue

660
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:11,600
proteases they will
degrade that granulation

661
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:15,340
tissue and you cannot
have a good uh repair

662
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:21,120
or or scar uh hypoxia
if you have a loss

663
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,900
of if the blood vessels
and the blood rbcs

664
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:28,260
don't bring enough
oxygen then you're going

665
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:31,180
to have a problem
with wound healing and

666
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:33,600
that happens with
inadequate circulation

667
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,280
arteriosclerosis things
like that uh diabetes for

668
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:40,240
example trauma uh if
you have a trauma to

669
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,840
i mean if you're all
you know have a nice

670
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,980
wound there that somebody
stitched and then

671
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,800
you go and rip it
open for some you know

672
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,980
because you you stood
the wrong way that's not

673
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:50,840
good foreign bodies
that's why we debride

674
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,840
wounds the foreign
bodies are things like

675
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,060
rocks and glass and
things from motorcycle

676
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:57,900
accidents um you know
bullets things like that

677
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:00,080
they have to be
debrided they have to be

678
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,320
taken out or else you're
going to have a problem

679
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,460
with wound healing and
I mentioned diabetes

680
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:07,400
because you got
glycosylation that will

681
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:11,660
impair neutrophil and
macrophagocytosis and

682
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,460
you'll learn more
about that in diabetes

683
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:16,180
malnutrition like I
mentioned scurvy will

684
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:19,110
decrease the proliferation
phase immunodeficiency

685
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:22,320
some medications like
steroids will blunt

686
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,480
the inflammatory
process etc hormones and

687
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,080
the mechanics of the
like if you have a wound

688
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,880
right over the elbow
joint that's gonna

689
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,060
be a little harder you
have to keep it in a

690
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:38,240
certain state so again
everything depends on

691
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,320
the size the location
the type of wound

692
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,800
remember the face is
very very vascular and it

693
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,480
heals faster than
something like the foot

694
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:49,840
which is not so vascular
complications well

695
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,640
there are a lot of
complications but the big

696
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,660
ones i want you to
know about are wound

697
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:57,800
dehiscence and
ulceration uh keloid and

698
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,060
contractures and in wound
dehiscence basically

699
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:02,120
you don't have enough
scar formation and the

700
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:05,540
wound just comes apart
in excessive scar

701
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:07,820
formation we have the
formation of what is known

702
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:10,480
as keloids which is
basically scar tissue

703
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,800
that extends beyond
the boundaries of the

704
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,640
original wound which is
more common in darker

705
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,780
skinned people but
can happen in anyone.

706
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:22,580
I want to make the
distinction between keloid

707
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,800
and hypertrophic scar.
A hypertrophic scar

708
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,440
means you have a lot
an excessive amount

709
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,860
of collagen and get a
raised scar but it does

710
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:31,400
not extend beyond the
boundary of the original

711
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,920
wound and then
contractures that happen

712
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:37,460
in palms and soles
especially in burn victims

713
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:40,780
where you get lot of
contracture so this

714
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:43,600
is a person who had
a dehiscence of their

715
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,860
wound very commonly
this happens um i should

716
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:50,580
say most commonly in
abdominal surgery and

717
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:53,980
obesity can contribute
to it vomiting coughing

718
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:57,100
can you burst the
wound open so there's

719
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,680
some increased abdominal
pressure and that

720
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,200
can happen and of
course that's not good

721
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:05,980
ulceration especially
in poor circulation like

722
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:08,380
in diabetes and peripheral
vascular disease.

723
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:11,600
And this is a
very good example,

724
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,680
a bad example,
if you will, of

725
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,380
a keloid from
an ear piercing.

726
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:17,040
And again, I want you
to know that keloid

727
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,180
and hypertrophic scars
are two different things.

728
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,940
In keloid, you have
a lot of collagen

729
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:23,520
forming. It's very
disorganized. It extends

730
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:26,440
beyond the borders of
the bone. And the problem

731
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,080
with keloids, and this
is really upsetting

732
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,390
because I once saw
this in a plastic

733
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,080
surgery clinic, they
frequently recur after you

734
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,580
so you take out the
scar the high keloid

735
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:39,020
and you get more keloid
it's extremely difficult

736
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:42,640
to treat extremely
difficult um hypertrophic

737
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,920
is parallel collagen
it's confined to

738
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,420
the borders of the
original wound and it

739
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:51,520
doesn't really recur if
you remove it okay so

740
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:54,340
this is something um
that's important in wound

741
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:58,320
healing uh and you
want to it is treated

742
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,680
different ways and I
don't deal with treatment,

743
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,180
but I want you to
know the difference.

744
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,860
So now we're going to
just review and then

745
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:07,140
do some questions and
be done with this.

746
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,660
This is basically, I
don't have to read it

747
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:11,460
all to you, but this
is a review of what

748
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:15,700
I just said about VEGF
being important with

749
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,660
vessel permeability,
the neutrophils in

750
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:20,680
24 hours to clean
out everything, and

751
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:24,580
macrophages by about 48
to 96 again not an exact

752
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:28,460
number and angiogenesis
extracellular

753
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:31,740
matrix deposition the
fibroblasts migrate to

754
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:33,840
the injury site and
that's all orchestrated

755
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,600
by things like cytokines
and these growth

756
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,560
factors and they
proliferate the fibroblasts

757
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,940
mostly coming by
growth factors that

758
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:46,120
come from the macrophages
so at 24 to 48 hours

759
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,080
the epithelial cells
move from the wound

760
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:51,280
edge along the margins
of the dermis and

761
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,160
they put down basement
membrane components

762
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:56,000
and you get a nice
thin epithelial layer.

763
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:59,200
When you have a bigger
wound, you need an

764
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,400
increase in collagen
fibers to bridge that.

765
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,720
Again, I want to mention
granulation tissue

766
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,700
five to seven days is
about four to seven

767
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:08,580
days, five to seven
days. That is really the

768
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:12,220
presence of
angiogenesis or vascular

769
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:14,640
endothelial cells
proliferating and fibroblasts

770
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,940
and also macrophages
are there. So it's like

771
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,800
three really big
elements that are there.

772
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:20,220
Neovascularization is the

773
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:22,060
same thing as
angiogenesis.

774
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:25,020
By the second week,
if everything goes

775
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:27,380
well, your white
cells should be gone.

776
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,500
Your inflammation should
be gone if you want

777
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,380
to heal. So should
the edema and the

778
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:35,160
increase in vascularity.
And I'm going to repeat

779
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,760
myself from something
in the beginning.

780
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:40,220
TGF beta is one of
the most important

781
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:43,120
fibrogenic agent, and it
causes the fibroblasts

782
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,320
to migrate and
proliferate and, of

783
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,940
course, increased
synthesis of collagen.

784
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,740
Okay, so again,
this is just a more

785
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,720
continuation of
what I've just said,

786
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,390
and a lot of this
is repetition.

787
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:00,200
Scar is a cellular
connective tissue. There's

788
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,360
no inflammation in
it, and it's usually

789
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,660
covered by intact
epithelium, not always.

790
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,320
Okay, so let's do a few
questions. Okay, this

791
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,840
first question you
can read. You can stop

792
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:12,440
the video, whatever you
want to do, and it's

793
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,300
about an experiment
that's being conducted

794
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,320
on the effects of
certain drugs on wound

795
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,320
healing and the uh they
give them a drug a and

796
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:22,020
they make a cut in the
thigh of a lab rat and

797
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:25,080
one week later a biopsy
is taken from that

798
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:28,560
area and when you look
under the microscope

799
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:33,540
you see capillaries
fibroblasts and some

800
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:36,720
inflammatory cells
mostly macrophages with

801
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,120
some occasional
neutrophils so what are we

802
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,620
talking about are we
talking about scar tissue

803
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:45,120
granulan granulation
tissue purulent tissue

804
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,880
or permanent tissue
and hopefully after

805
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:50,180
this you understand
that this answer is B as

806
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:52,780
in boy granulation
tissue okay this is not

807
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:54,760
scar tissue scar
tissue does not have

808
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:57,440
vessels or inflammation
purulent tissue means

809
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:01,560
pus also known as super
super super super and

810
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,880
permanent tissue of
things like nerves and

811
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:06,230
and and skeletal muscle
and cardiac muscle

812
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:08,820
next question is a
70 year old woman who

813
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,900
comes in with shortness
of breath and chest

814
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:14,460
pain obviously we're
going here along with

815
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:17,180
a myocardial infarction
she undergoes cardiac

816
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:21,260
catheterization which
shows that the left

817
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:23,280
anterior descending
coronary artery is

818
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,960
occluded and all the
lab studies that occur

819
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,960
in the EKG show that
indeed she has an acute

820
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,620
MI so which of the
following is the most

821
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:35,840
likely pathological
finding in that affected

822
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,760
heart muscle six weeks
later again we're

823
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,100
talking about cardiac
muscle which does not

824
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:45,280
regenerate by six weeks
you should not have

825
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,580
vessels or inflammation
what you should have

826
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:50,400
is is a good start if
not you know almost

827
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,700
ending of this of the
scar tissue so the

828
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:56,600
answer here is d as
in david collagen rich

829
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,400
scar tissue the other
answers are incorrect

830
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:03,840
third question is a 10
year old boy who gets

831
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:06,380
a deep laceration
over his right eyebrow

832
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:09,280
when he plays ice hockey
they clean the wound

833
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,300
they suture it which
of the following

834
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,960
describes the principal
function of macrophages

835
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,660
that are present in
that wound about 48

836
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:18,560
hours after injury
again it's approximate

837
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,880
and hopefully your eyes
would go straight to

838
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:25,100
d as in david
phagocytosis and

839
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,020
that at that
moment 48 hours

840
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:28,400
that's what's
most important

841
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:31,560
that the macrophages are
doing are phagocytosis

842
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:33,700
in the previous
question which of the

843
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,380
following college and
there's a positive

844
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:38,260
first during wound
healing so this is a type

845
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:40,700
you know a first order
question just whether

846
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,460
you know it or not
and just remember

847
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:44,360
that the first one or
the immature one is

848
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:47,920
type three so the answer
is c as in charlie

849
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,280
and type one is the
mature here's a summary

850
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,280
slide and the lecture
feedback form thank

851
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,120
