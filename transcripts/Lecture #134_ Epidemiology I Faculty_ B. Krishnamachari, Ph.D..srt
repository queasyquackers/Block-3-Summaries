00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:02,680
Hello, and
welcome to your

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,480
first epidemiology
lecture.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,640
There are several
objectives for this

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,860
session that I hope
that you will be able

5
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:12,040
to achieve by the
end of this lecture.

6
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,720
You should be able
to define basic

7
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:18,840
epidemiological terms,
as well as learn more

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,140
about study designs
for any given

9
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,760
circumstance. You should
be able to calculate

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,460
some basic epidemiological
measures and

11
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,520
defend these in
terms of discussing

12
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,200
different diseases.
and you should be able

13
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,240
to interpret these
different measures.

14
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,660
So just to summarize
what we'll start talking

15
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,320
about, epidemiology
is the study of the

16
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,440
patterns, causes, and
effects of health and

17
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:47,120
disease conditions in
different populations.

18
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,000
There are several measures
that you must know.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,720
So we will go ahead
and just start with

20
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,400
some of the more basic
of these measures and

21
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,480
then continue on to
more complicated topics.

22
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,610
We're going to begin
our discussion with

23
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:05,260
talking about rates
and epidemiology.

24
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,160
So let's start with a

25
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,680
seemingly
simple question.

26
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,940
If five different
people today have told

27
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,200
me that their allergies
are out of control,

28
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,440
does that mean something

29
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,820
is going on with the air?

30
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,560
Well, this is a
fairly common thing

31
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,560
that happens. Maybe
you're talking to

32
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,860
your friends and
you mentioned that

33
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,980
everybody you know
is getting sick.

34
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,820
And this is a count.
A count is the

35
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,820
simplest and most
frequently performed

36
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,240
quantitative measure
in epidemiology.

37
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,000
It refers to the
number of cases of a

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,220
disease or other
health phenomena being

39
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,120
studied. It's actually
very significant for

40
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,680
rare diseases or
symptoms such as Ebola.

41
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,260
So if someone
says to you, I've

42
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:49,080
heard that two
different people at

43
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,400
our university got
Ebola this week,

44
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,320
that would mean
something to you.

45
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,340
However, when it's
something common

46
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,560
like allergies,
it may not mean

47
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,880
the same thing to
you. At this point,

48
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,760
what becomes
important is a rate.

49
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:05,300
So a rate, by definition,
is a ratio that

50
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,700
consists of a numerator
and a denominator,

51
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,880
and in which time forms a

52
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,500
component of
the denominator.

53
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,220
In epidemiology,
it contains

54
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,740
the following elements.

55
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,320
Disease frequency,

56
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,880
unit size of the
population, and the

57
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,680
time period during
which an event occurs.

58
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,380
So the first
thing we're going

59
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,440
to talk about is
incidence rate.

60
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,720
The incidence rate
is the number of new

61
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,800
cases of a disease
that occur during

62
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,460
a specified period of
time in a population

63
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,620
at risk for developing
the disease.

64
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,960
Now, that's a fairly
simple sounding

65
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,500
definition, but there
are several things

66
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,320
that you need to
pay attention to.

67
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,900
Now, the first thing
I'll mention is that

68
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,480
incidence rates are
usually pretty small.

69
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,980
It's very rare
that you hear about

70
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,680
huge numbers of people
getting diseased.

71
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,780
So when you
look at a whole

72
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,620
population, you may
come up with incidence

73
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:00,420
rates that are
things like 0.0003.

74
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:05,460
Now, usually it's very
hard conceptually to

75
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:08,440
think about a human
being in terms of a

76
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,520
decimal. We're really
used to talking about

77
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,320
full human beings. So
normally you're going

78
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,940
to see that number
multiplied by a thousand

79
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,360
or a much bigger number
so that you can say

80
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,320
something like one in
every thousand people

81
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:25,140
have a new incidence
of this disease. But

82
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,680
remember I said there
are a lot of things you

83
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,540
have to pay attention
to in this definition.

84
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,640
The first thing is
that what defines an

85
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,120
incidence rate is that
it is new cases of

86
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,500
diseases only in your
specified time period.

87
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,880
So it doesn't include
the people who are

88
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,860
already there, who
already had the disease at

89
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:45,380
the time that you
started your time count.

90
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,700
The incidence rate
is a measure of risk.

91
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,720
This is really what
tells you in a given

92
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,380
time period what are
the chances that you

93
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,960
could get this disease.
The other thing to

94
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,640
really pay attention to
is that the denominator

95
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,140
is the number of
people who are at

96
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,300
risk for developing
the disease. Not every

97
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,200
person is at risk for
developing every disease.

98
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:10,140
So if you're
calculating an incidence

99
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,500
rate of uterine
cancer, the denominator

100
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,040
should only include
women and they should

101
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,220
have a uterus. So you
have to make sure you

102
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,940
found out whether
or not they had a

103
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:21,480
hysterectomy. And if
they don't have a uterus,

104
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,930
then they wouldn't be
in your calculation.

105
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,980
So an example of this
is a number of new

106
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:32,310
cases. Let's say in
this case, it was 1,085.

107
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:36,860
And you divide that by
a total population at

108
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,360
risk, which was 37,000.
And you see, you get

109
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,440
this kind of tiny
number 0.02924. And it's

110
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,500
really hard to tell
somebody that you're

111
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,800
going to have an incidence
rate of 0.029. It

112
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,240
doesn't mean that much
to people. So it makes

113
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,120
a lot more sense to
multiply it and say per

114
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,060
10,000 women, 292 might
get uterine cancer.

115
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:04,360
Now, I said that when
you're calculating

116
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,180
incidence rate,
you can't count the

117
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,580
people who already
had the disease at

118
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,340
the time you started
your calculation.

119
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,480
Those people go
into a separate type

120
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,060
of rate called the
prevalence rate. The

121
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,740
prevalence rate
is the number of

122
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,860
affected people in
the population at a

123
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,820
specific time divided
by the number of

124
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,980
people in the
population at that time.

125
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,800
Now, a common question
I get is, does that

126
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,380
denominator also have
to be only people

127
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,680
at risk? And the
question is a good

128
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,200
question, and the answer
is that it depends.

129
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:39,740
Either way, you just
have to specify exactly

130
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,080
what your denominator
is, and some of it

131
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,040
depends on context. So
when you're talking to

132
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,740
a medical population
and you're trying to

133
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:51,360
describe how a disease
is occurring, it makes

134
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,560
a lot more sense to
say, this is the number

135
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,760
of affected people in
the population out of

136
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:00,280
the number of people
who even had the risk

137
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,100
of having the disease.
And you can specify

138
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,420
that. But let's say
you're going to the

139
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:07,220
government to say, I need
you to give me money.

140
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,920
Then they may want
to know, well,

141
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,140
what are the
number of affected

142
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,320
people out of
all of my voters?

143
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,320
Either way, there are
different circumstances.

144
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,360
You may use different
denominators, but

145
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,460
the important thing
is to always specify.

146
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,000
And this is different
than an incidence

147
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,460
rate where it is always
new cases divided

148
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,860
people who are
actually at risk for

149
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,100
the disease. And the
reason, again, is that

150
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,380
incidence rate is
a measure of risk.

151
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,580
Prevalence rate is
not a measure of risk.

152
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,740
This is just trying
to tell you what

153
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:39,140
is the cross-section
of the proportion of

154
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,440
population that is
affected right now.

155
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,580
Again, the interpretation
of prevalence

156
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,380
really is just there to
tell you the indication

157
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:52,460
of the extent of the
health problem. If

158
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,900
you find out the
prevalence of diarrhea in a

159
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:59,180
children's camp on
July 13th was 33%, then

160
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:02,840
you might be concerned
as a parent. You might

161
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,300
look at it in a
certain period of time

162
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,380
and talk about it as in
a specific period the

163
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,560
prevalence of cancer
in women was, whatever

164
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,020
it was. But either
way, it's really there

165
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,560
to tell you what the
burden of disease is.

166
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,400
Now, there is a
relationship between

167
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,960
incidence and
prevalence. You can do it

168
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,700
mathematically and see
that prevalence equals

169
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,840
incidence times the
duration of a disease.

170
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:31,600
So again, if you're
asked what kind of

171
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,700
rate could tell me
what my measure of

172
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,820
risk is, how likely am
I to get this disease?

173
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,100
Assuming I'm at
risk, this is only

174
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,920
the incidence rate.
This is the only thing

175
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,340
that measures the
rate of new cases.

176
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,340
Prevalence measures
existing cases.

177
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,860
Now, what if you're
trying to calculate

178
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,320
an incidence rate and
you just don't have

179
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,680
very good information
on the people in your

180
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,640
denominator, namely
the people at risk?

181
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,420
So maybe you tried
to keep track of

182
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,120
the people at risk,
but some of them

183
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,420
stopped reporting
to you, some of them

184
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,660
moved away, and now
you're worried that

185
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,340
your numbers aren't
really accurate.

186
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:15,100
So one thing you
can do is instead of

187
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,340
treating your denominator
as the number of

188
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,620
people at risk, you
can assign them person

189
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:23,040
years. What this does
is gives every person

190
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,960
credit for the amount
of time that they

191
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,300
were actually followed.
So you'd still look

192
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,180
at your number of
people who reported a

193
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:33,320
disease, but instead
of saying that it is

194
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,440
out of the people
who are at risk, you

195
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,180
would give each person
a number of years that

196
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:42,860
they contributed. So
if one person gave

197
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:45,520
you a year, they'd get
one person year. If

198
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,460
another person kept
in touch for five

199
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,060
years, then they'd get
five years, but there

200
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:53,380
are some problems.
So one person at risk

201
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:56,040
who was observed for
five years has given

202
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,940
you five person years,
but if five different

203
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:01,720
people at risk each
gave you one year,

204
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,820
that also counts as
five person years. And

205
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,040
at the end of the day,
five years from one

206
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,220
person isn't actually
the same as one year

207
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:12,840
from five separate
people. So it's no matter

208
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,000
how you do it, there
are always going to

209
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,160
be some problems and
there is no perfect

210
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,760
way, but this is just
an alternate way of

211
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,720
doing things. We're
now going to go over a

212
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,640
fictional case for the
purposes of talking

213
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,440
about incidence and
prevalence. So let's

214
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,700
imagine you're a first
-year emergency medicine

215
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,020
resident in Los Angeles,
and your attending

216
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,820
has asked you to
help her investigate

217
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:36,540
the behavior of a new
illness and assist with

218
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,780
public health solutions
to this disease.

219
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,840
So this is what you
already know. The

220
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,620
new illness causes
high fevers, headaches,

221
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,680
seizures, and in
many cases, death.

222
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,040
The illness is unique
in that it also

223
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,340
presents with a
blistering red raised

224
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,660
rash that often
appears in streaks.

225
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,500
Most cases first
present in the emergency

226
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,880
room as the disease
progresses rapidly

227
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,940
once the initial
symptoms appear.

228
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,240
There is some
suspicion that this

229
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,940
illness may have
originated in Senegal,

230
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,040
as many of the
individuals seen with

231
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,920
the disease have
visited the country.

232
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,800
So you start to gather
information. You

233
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,640
learn that there are
no estimates available

234
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,700
for the incidence rate
of the disease, but

235
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,150
the disease-specific
mortality rate in the

236
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,520
population due to this
disease is thought

237
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,320
to be two per a thousand
people. The disease

238
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,380
is considered severe
and lethal, and

239
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,360
reportedly people die
shortly after diagnosis.

240
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,860
So now, using that
information, could you

241
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:39,140
estimate the incidence
rate? Well, here's

242
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,460
what we know is that
for a severe disease,

243
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,280
mortality rates can
serve as measures

244
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:47,520
both of disease
severity, but also of

245
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,520
incidence rates. The
idea here is that if you

246
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,400
have a disease that
people definitely

247
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,710
die from, then it can
be a surrogate because

248
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:57,560
everybody who died
of the disease

249
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,060
obviously had the disease,
and now the incidence

250
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:04,160
rate would equal what
the fatality rate

251
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,660
is. So case fatality
is a term that's

252
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:10,600
talking about cases
where people die very

253
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,660
quickly and time is
implicitly expressed.

254
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,300
It's not even really
included because the

255
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,040
idea is somebody gets
sick and then they die.

256
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,720
So in this case,
you could estimate

257
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,920
the incidence
rate to be that

258
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,960
rate, which is
two in a thousand.

259
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:29,460
So now let's say upon
investigating further,

260
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,700
you realize that the
mortality rate people

261
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,840
are quoting may not
be entirely accurate.

262
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,000
it. So while there
has been an attempt to

263
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,280
calculate the actual
incidence rate, it's been

264
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,820
complicated by an
inability to keep track of

265
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,260
all the people in the
LA population. Some

266
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:46,240
people moved or they
were just lost to follow

267
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,320
up. So now is there
an alternate way of

268
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,800
calculating this incidence
rate when the number

269
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,620
of people who were at
risk for the disease

270
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,500
weren't all followed
for the same time

271
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,460
period? And this is
where you can use person

272
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:01,320
years. If you only have
a certain amount of

273
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,800
time from certain
people, you can take that

274
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,040
amount of time and give
them credit for that.

275
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:09,160
So now let's just
say a cure is quickly

276
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,840
developed for this
disease. So therefore,

277
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,160
the disease no longer
exists in the person.

278
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:17,840
What would that do to
the prevalence rate?

279
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:21,480
And what if instead
of actually curing

280
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,360
it, you developed a
treatment and now it's

281
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,240
still there, but it's
no longer deadly. And

282
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,180
what would happen to
prevalence then? So

283
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:33,580
this is an important
concept because you

284
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:37,080
can't simplify by
saying when a prevalence

285
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,280
of a disease has
decreased, it's always

286
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,600
good. And that when
it's increased, it's

287
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,240
always bad. Unfortunately,
if somebody dies,

288
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,320
then the disease is
also gone, in which

289
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:50,180
case the prevalence
would decrease. But it

290
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:52,520
could also be that
you developed a cure,

291
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,720
in which case the
prevalence would decrease.

292
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,720
But if you just manage
to treat it, then

293
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,640
the prevalence would
actually increase.

294
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,940
But it could also be
that the disease is

295
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,700
getting worse and
therefore the prevalence

296
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,400
is increased. So
you really need more

297
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,940
information than just
rates. So really, what

298
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,540
can lower prevalence?
Death or cure. And

299
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,700
those are very, very,
very different things.

300
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,640
So you need to look
beyond the numbers.

301
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,700
So does an increase
in prevalence mean the

302
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,040
problem is getting
worse? Well, I have to

303
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,040
say that if you were
looking at like a news

304
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,640
outlet and they're not
scientifically trained,

305
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,120
that may be how they
interpret things.

306
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,420
But for example, when
insulin first became

307
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:36,180
available, the prevalence
of diabetes increased.

308
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,480
The disease was not
cured, but it was

309
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,040
controlled. And many
people who formerly would

310
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,560
have died now survived.
So the prevalence

311
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,580
increased and it was
actually a positive.

312
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,500
So upon studying what
you can about this

313
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,060
disease, you learn
that this disease

314
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,260
has always been present
in small amounts

315
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:56,060
in Senegal. There
appears to be no increase

316
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:58,340
in disease rates
there at this time.

317
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:02,420
This brings us to the
terms endemic, epidemic,

318
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,800
and pandemic, all
of which people have

319
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,440
become very familiar
with in recent years.

320
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,360
But it's still worth
going through what

321
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,880
these things are and
how you define them.

322
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:16,760
A disease that is
endemic is something that

323
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,160
is just habitually
there. It's considered

324
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,860
normal at a certain
rate in that region.

325
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,680
An epidemic happens
when the rates

326
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,300
exceed what you
consider to be normal.

327
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,700
And if this happens
all over the world,

328
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,480
it becomes a
pandemic. So the same

329
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,920
disease can be endemic
in one area and

330
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,320
become an epidemic
in a different area.

331
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:42,000
Even within a particular
area, a disease

332
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,420
can have a definition
of epidemic if

333
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:48,260
it's in excess of
what you expect. But

334
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,700
then if it goes back
to kind of a habitual

335
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,000
level, it can become
endemic in that

336
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,400
same place it used
to be an epidemic.

337
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,060
it.

338
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,580
So now in the U.S.,
in our fictional

339
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,780
scenario, given that
there was no presence

340
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:04,000
of the disease
until recently, the

341
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,980
disease rate is
considered grossly

342
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:08,160
in excess of what's
considered normal.

343
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,660
Now you learn
that the disease

344
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,680
has also shown up
in excess rates

345
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,120
in Japan, parts
of South America,

346
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,520
France, and England,
and that people are

347
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:21,100
rapidly dying from the
disease. So now you

348
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,460
do have theoretically
a pandemic. However,

349
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,600
now you really have
to start looking at

350
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,800
your rates and whether
or not you're calculating

351
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,820
your numbers
correctly. And somebody

352
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,060
points out to you
that you can't really

353
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,580
compare mortality rates
between two countries

354
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,460
because they may have
completely different

355
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:40,360
demographics. For
instance, if you have

356
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,620
one country that's
very, very young in a

357
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,940
different country where
everybody's considerably

358
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:48,600
older, you might
have some issues

359
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,520
there because the
people who are older are

360
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,580
more likely to die. So
then what do you do?

361
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:57,160
So what we've talked
about in this class is

362
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,240
a crude rate. And what
a crude rate is, is

363
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,820
that you just take the
numbers you have and

364
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:06,200
you do simple division.
In actuality, in

365
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,260
real life, you don't
usually use crude rates.

366
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,340
You have to use some
caution because you

367
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,480
haven't accounted for
anything other than the

368
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,500
numbers in front of
you. In real life, there

369
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,020
are often differences
in gender, age, or

370
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,700
race distributions
within populations, and

371
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,860
you have to mathematically
account for that.

372
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:27,460
Here is where we
would probably be more

373
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:30,120
likely to use something
called a specific rate.

374
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,800
Now, the simplest
way to do this is to

375
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,000
simply stratify groups.
If you just think

376
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,480
that the rates of
disease are different in

377
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,600
younger people than
older people, perhaps you

378
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,960
can just report two
separate numbers, and

379
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,540
now you have the numbers
in each age group.

380
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,900
That would certainly
solved the problem.

381
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:52,180
But it can get complicated
when you have a

382
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:55,200
lot of different demographic
factors that vary

383
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,920
between people. So
here, what you actually

384
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,280
end up hearing about
more often than not is

385
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,400
adjusted rates. So if
you hear about rates

386
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,900
like worldwide cancer
incidences, if you look

387
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:11,230
at the fine print, it
will talk about using

388
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:14,700
a standard population
to mathematically

389
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,180
adjust. Now, you don't
have to do that in the

390
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:20,580
context of our class,
but this is what's

391
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:23,100
often done, is to take
different populations

392
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,780
and apply them all to
one standard population,

393
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:29,280
and the goal is to
eliminate the differences

394
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,640
between the populations
and demographics.

395
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:35,380
You can also use some
other mathematical

396
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,580
methods. These are
called indirect methods

397
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,280
when you don't have
a lot of numbers

398
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,100
available, but the end
result is the same.

399
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,580
It's trying to eliminate
the possibility

400
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:47,120
that these differences
are because of just

401
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,260
inherent differences
in the population.

402
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,900
We're going to
shift now to

403
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,820
thinking about
disease prevention.

404
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:57,640
Disease prevention
is categorized in

405
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,980
separate ways.
Primary prevention

406
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:02,280
is preventing the
initial development

407
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,620
of the disease,
and the biggest

408
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,480
example of this
would be vaccination.

409
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,220
Secondary
prevention is early

410
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,380
detection of an
existing disease to

411
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,520
reduce severity
and complications.

412
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,380
So for example,
mammograms, the goal is to

413
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:18,400
catch breast cancer
early so that it is

414
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,220
less severe if it's
there when you catch it.

415
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:23,900
Tertiary prevention
talks about reducing

416
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,880
the impact of a
disease. So basically

417
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,040
early treatment or
better treatment.

418
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,520
So now, if you were
considering introducing

419
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,620
a vaccine for this
disease for those

420
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,900
traveling to Senegal,
what are the different

421
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,840
things you would have
to consider about the

422
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,160
biology of the disease?
And what would you

423
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,320
have to consider about
the behaviors of the

424
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,360
people who would be
offered the vaccine?

425
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,490
Well, for the
biology, you have to

426
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:51,020
understand the disease
as well as you can. So

427
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,740
first of all, you
need to have isolated

428
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,820
the pathogen. Is it
a bacteria, a virus,

429
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:58,340
a ******, or something
else? And if it's

430
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:01,160
a virus, is it DNA,
RNA? Do you know

431
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,520
the genetic sequence?
Does it have a high

432
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,400
mutation rate? These
are all questions

433
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,500
that you're trying to
get the answers to.

434
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:11,020
Now, the other thing
is that people have

435
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:13,180
to actually be willing
to be vaccinated.

436
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,160
Herd immunity refers
to the fact that you

437
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,260
may not have to vaccinate
100% of the people.

438
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,220
However,

439
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:23,860
every disease has a
certain percent that

440
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:26,160
you need to vaccinate
to actually receive

441
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,080
immunity in the population.
And if everybody

442
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,540
decides they're not
going to do it because

443
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,400
of herd immunity and
let somebody else

444
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,800
do it, now you might
not actually achieve

445
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,700
herd immunity. But the
idea here is that a

446
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,280
group of people can
become resistant if

447
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,120
the majority end up
immune. So this is why

448
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,400
whenever you see vaccine
campaigns, you're

449
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,820
trying to get everybody
to vaccinate where

450
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,140
it can be safely done
and it's possible.

451
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,520
Now, upon questioning
several emergency

452
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,800
rooms in the LA area,
as well as several

453
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,280
primary care clinics,
you learn that there

454
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,340
have been some individuals
who appeared to

455
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,860
become ill shortly
after visiting Senegal,

456
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:08,120
while others became
sick several months

457
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,700
after living in
Senegal. So why is that?

458
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:14,690
Well, this has to do
with the incubation

459
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:17,520
period. This is the
interval from receipt of

460
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,980
the infection to onset
of the clinical illness.

461
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,620
The question is how
long a person should

462
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:25,500
be in isolation after
exposure to disease.

463
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:31,820
We're going to shift
from talking about

464
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,960
treating disease or
quantifying disease

465
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,260
and move into
screening. In a perfect

466
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:41,020
world, you would stop
people from getting

467
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:43,580
disease at all.
But given that we

468
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:46,240
don't always effectively
do that, the next

469
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,900
best thing is to
catch disease early.

470
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:52,140
So screening, by
definition, is

471
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:55,000
the identification
of unrecognized

472
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,180
disease by
administering a test.

473
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,190
Usually it is not
considered diagnostic.

474
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:03,660
You really have to
distinguish between a

475
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:06,680
screening test versus a
diagnostic test. There

476
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,520
are some tests that
are screening tests

477
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,260
that are so good that
some would argue that

478
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:14,840
it's almost diagnostic.
But For the purposes

479
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,600
of this lecture, a
screening test is

480
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,300
something that is really
meant to put people

481
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:24,020
in a category of
high risk versus not

482
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:27,160
high risk. And really
the intent is to figure

483
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,220
out whether or not
you need to proceed

484
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:33,460
with more intricate
diagnostic tests. The

485
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:36,880
goal is, as always, to
try to delay the onset

486
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,980
of disease and to try
to improve survival.

487
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:42,700
It seems very, very
simple, but it's

488
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:47,320
actually complex. It can
have hidden costs and

489
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:50,800
risks. So screening
can cause morbidity,

490
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,840
anxiety, and you
have to be aware of

491
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,920
different biases. You
need a suitable disease,

492
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,960
a suitable test, and
more than anything,

493
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,020
a suitable screening
program. If

494
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,420
people aren't
willing to take your

495
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,280
screening test, then
having developed a

496
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,280
screening test isn't
all that useful.

497
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:09,620
In order to create a
screening test, you

498
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,040
first have to classify
people as disease

499
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,980
or healthy and you
use a diagnostic test.

500
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,660
In this case, you're
assuming there is a

501
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:20,160
diagnostic test and
it's the gold standard

502
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,700
and it's telling you
that people definitely

503
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,440
have the disease or
don't have the disease.

504
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,960
You then are developing
your screening

505
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,160
test around that. So
you're developing the

506
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:34,020
screening test,
administering it, and you're

507
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:37,120
classifying people
as screen positive or

508
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,000
screen negative. You
can see on this table

509
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,060
that you can put this
in a little grid.

510
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:47,300
And so on the top, you
have the gold standard,

511
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,280
which is the diagnostic
test. And either

512
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,460
the disease is there
or it's not there.

513
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,960
And then you have a
screening test result

514
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,680
where they either
screened positive or

515
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,500
negative. And the whole
point here is to quantify

516
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,840
how well these are
tracking together as

517
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,460
you'd want it to be.
And so you end up with

518
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:07,120
these categories of
true positive, false

519
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,580
positive, false negative,
and true negative.

520
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:13,360
The reason that you
see letters with each

521
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,180
of these terms is
that one of the things

522
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:19,960
that you are going to
have to do is to learn

523
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,600
how to calculate these
numbers if you are

524
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:26,480
given such a question.
So we do this just

525
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,000
by making it A, B, C,
and D. And then you

526
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,160
have your totals,
which tells you that if

527
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,340
you have a positive
screening result, it would

528
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:36,120
be the true positives
plus the false

529
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,440
positives. If you have
a negative screening

530
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,680
result, that would be
the false negatives

531
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,400
and the true negatives.
And in every direction

532
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,760
of this grid, you
have things added up.

533
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,820
Now, as physicians,
this is one

534
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,920
of the things that
is going to most

535
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,580
often come up
in your clinics.

536
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,480
You're going to have
to decide whether or

537
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,760
not you want to order
a test, and you're

538
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,500
going to end up caring
about how sensitive

539
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,860
the test is, how
specific the test is.

540
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,360
These things are
going to make a lot

541
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,900
more sense when it's
on you to decide

542
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,660
whether or not you
want to order it.

543
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:12,040
But for now, you have
to understand it,

544
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,880
at least in terms of
definition, and you

545
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,480
also have to understand
what that means and

546
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,160
what it translates
into as an equation.

547
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,700
So sensitivity is the
ability of the test

548
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,300
to identify correctly
all screened

549
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,580
individuals who actually
have the disease.

550
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,060
You can see that there
is a corresponding

551
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:33,080
equation, which is
true positives divided

552
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,940
by true positive
plus false negative.

553
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,740
Specificity is the
ability of the test

554
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:42,540
to identify only non
-diseased individuals

555
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,600
who genuinely don't
have the disease.

556
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,120
So this is true
negative divided by

557
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,340
the true negatives
and false positives.

558
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:52,600
People often
incorrectly think that

559
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,580
one is the opposite
of the other,

560
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:55,980
and it's not.
They're actually

561
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,240
two different
measures of a test.

562
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,120
Sensitivity tells
you how well a

563
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,140
test is good at
picking up disease,

564
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:05,920
and specificity
tells you how well

565
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,820
a test is at
picking up healthy

566
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:10,200
people. So you
almost have to just

567
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,520
separate those two
things in your head.

568
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:16,260
but with that said
specificity and sensitivity

569
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:20,140
are characteristics
of the test most human

570
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:23,120
beings if a patient
comes into you they're

571
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,400
not asking you what
is the characteristic

572
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,860
of the test you're
running on me that's not

573
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,500
really their question
that's your question as

574
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:33,040
a physician but the
patient's question is

575
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,600
if i screen positive
what's the chance i

576
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,320
actually have a disease
if i screen negative

577
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,740
what's my chance i really
don't have the disease

578
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,320
that's the question
they're going to ask

579
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,360
you. And these are
different measures. These

580
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,280
are predictive value.
And these measures are

581
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:52,120
actually more representative
of a population.

582
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:55,580
So predictive value,
when it's a positive

583
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:57,560
predictive value,
is the proportion of

584
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,500
individuals screened
positive by the test who

585
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,940
actually have the disease.
Negative predictive

586
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:06,260
value is the proportion
of individuals who

587
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:08,260
screen negative by the
test who really don't

588
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:10,460
have the disease. And
these are the numbers

589
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:13,100
you most often end up
quoting to a patient.

590
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:16,260
Now, one of the
things you have

591
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,460
to consider when you're

592
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,540
selecting a test
is reliability.

593
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:22,700
Reliability is the
ability of a measuring

594
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,260
instrument to give
consistent results on

595
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:28,500
repeated trials. But
you have to know that

596
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,600
a screening test
that's reliable is not

597
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:34,060
necessarily also valid.
The best example I

598
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:36,260
can give people is that
we all know somebody

599
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:38,600
who's just reliably
annoying all the

600
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,540
time. Are they reliable?
Yes. Are they always

601
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,940
going to annoy you?
Yes. Are they pretty

602
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:47,060
much always not
valid? Yes. So when

603
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,300
you're picking a test,
you really want to

604
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,780
consider all aspects
of what you're picking.

605
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:55,300
So now let's just say
you went through this

606
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,020
process, you wanted
to make a brand new

607
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:00,740
screening test, you
pick out your people who

608
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,800
have disease or don't
have disease, you had

609
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,540
the diagnostic test
to make your gold

610
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:07,240
standard, yes or no,
now you administer the

611
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,800
screening test and you
calculate a number that

612
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:13,400
says 80% sensitivity.
What does that mean?

613
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,220
Well, what it means is
that of all the people

614
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,780
with the disease, you
correctly identified

615
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:22,880
80% of them using
your screening test.

616
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,100
Now, let's say
the screening

617
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,540
test you
developed has 90%

618
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,180
specificity. What
does that mean?

619
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:33,800
So 90% specificity
means that of all the

620
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,160
healthy people who
don't have the disease,

621
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:39,660
you're correctly
identifying 90% of them as

622
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,920
being healthy using
your screening test.

623
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,020
So now back to our
case. The next time you

624
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,960
see a patient in clinic
with this disease,

625
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,700
you mention that
you have a screening

626
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,880
test that may be useful
for the other family

627
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,220
members who recently
traveled to Senegal

628
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:56,820
and the test is both
sensitive and specific.

629
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,820
But your patient and
their family tell

630
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,120
you that they don't
really know what you're

631
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,720
talking about. They've
never heard these

632
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,520
terms, sensitive or
specific. All they want

633
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,640
to know is if they
test positive on the

634
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,740
screening test, what
is the probability

635
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:10,600
they're actually going
to have the disease?

636
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:15,500
And in order to
do this, what

637
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,320
you want to do
is to talk about

638
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,140
positive
predictive value.

639
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:23,100
Okay, so we're going to

640
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,220
shift now to survival.

641
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:29,800
People get sick despite
all our efforts.

642
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,460
People get sick. Sometimes
they get very severely

643
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:35,600
sick. And a common
question is, what is

644
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,540
the probability that
having survived a first

645
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:41,200
year of treatment,
that person will now

646
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,580
survive the second
year? This comes up most

647
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:47,150
often in cancer, where
a very common question

648
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:49,360
is, how long am I
going to make it? Am I

649
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,520
going to make it? How
long will I be here?

650
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,760
The follow-up question
to that is, they've

651
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:57,380
survived to the end of
the first year, then

652
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:59,540
what's the chance if
they survive to the

653
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:01,140
second year that
then they're going to

654
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,840
survive to the next
year? So oftentimes you

655
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,620
end up hearing about
five-year survival rate

656
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,400
in cancer, and this
is where that comes

657
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,180
from. These calculations
can be presented

658
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:13,100
graphically in a
survival curve and there

659
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,500
are multiple methods
to make these curves.

660
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,080
One of the most common is

661
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,640
the Kaplan-Meier curve.

662
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:23,120
Now, when you're
looking at

663
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,300
results from
screening studies, you

664
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,170
have to consider
a few biases.

665
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:31,080
The first is lead time
bias. This is something

666
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,980
that you see a
lot in cancer. The

667
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:37,240
question becomes when
exactly were the groups

668
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:40,440
you are comparing first
diagnosed? Did the

669
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,460
two groups you're
comparing have different

670
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:45,460
protocols for their
diagnoses? So perhaps

671
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:48,540
you're trying to compare
one type of screening

672
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:52,500
to another. Well,
what if one group

673
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,280
was diagnosed much
earlier? They were very

674
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,660
good at going to the
doctor and getting their

675
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,440
diagnosis, and
therefore it was written

676
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,900
down in their medical
record much sooner.

677
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:05,740
And now it looks like
their survival is

678
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:08,280
longer because they've
just had the official

679
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,860
diagnosis for longer.
And now let's say the

680
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:13,740
other group just didn't
get screened. And

681
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:17,740
so now it makes it look
like their survival

682
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:20,820
is very poor, but in
actuality, both groups

683
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,320
may have exactly the
same survival. So

684
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,360
you really have to
pay attention to the

685
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,060
behavior of the groups
that you're studying.

686
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,220
The second kind of
bias is also something

687
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:33,580
that you see quite often
when you're looking

688
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:36,300
at cancer studies, but
you have to consider

689
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,470
that screening could
selectively identify

690
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,300
cases of the disease
where there's a

691
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:43,220
better prognosis. It's
called length bias

692
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:46,100
because the idea is that
severe disease might

693
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,260
result in early death,
therefore there's

694
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:50,740
shorter disease length,
and they may never

695
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:53,000
even make it to
screening. whereas those

696
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,300
people with a milder
disease would be around

697
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,940
longer and therefore
have a longer length

698
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:00,060
and then they actually
have screening and it

699
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:02,040
makes it look like
the screening is what

700
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,480
led to survival but in
actuality the milder

701
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,180
disease is what led
to better survival. So

702
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,940
those are all things
that you just want to

703
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,140
think about when
you're really thinking

704
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:13,980
about the effectiveness
of screening. So now

705
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:16,760
this concludes this
epidemiology section.

706
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:20,020
Make sure please
that you understand

707
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,840
all of the listed
objectives and

708
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,760
I will see you at
epidemiology too.
