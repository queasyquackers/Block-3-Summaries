00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:03,770
Welcome, students,
to Clinical

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:07,510
Pharmacokinetics,
Part 2. As I said in

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:10,110
Part 1, actually,
this is one lecture

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:12,530
because all of
the concepts are

5
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:14,690
integrated. Dr.
Goldstein speaking.

6
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,250
Same learning
objectives for

7
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,370
this part because,
as I said,

8
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:24,250
yet again, it
is one lecture.

9
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:32,110
suggestions and links
if you care to use

10
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:36,310
them the no one
understand is in part one

11
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:42,050
so let us begin with
the half-life half-life

12
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:45,150
is the time required
to reduce the amount

13
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:47,890
of drug in the body
by one half during

14
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:53,210
elimination. In other
words, drug concentration

15
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:57,490
decreases by 50%
in drugs that have

16
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:02,590
first order kinetics,
which is by far 99.9999

17
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:05,850
% of them at therapeutic
concentrations.

18
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:12,410
Half-life equals,
this is a constant,

19
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:15,320
an elimination
constant, 0.693.

20
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:20,790
Some people just move
it to 0.7 just to

21
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,450
be able to do calculations
in their head.

22
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:26,550
Times the volume
of distribution

23
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,830
divided by clearance.

24
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:33,770
So half-life is inversely

25
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:35,510
proportional
to clearance.

26
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:39,830
Clearance
decreases, half-life

27
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:41,770
increases. In other
words, it takes

28
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,670
longer to
eliminate the drug.

29
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:48,630
Half-life changes is
a function of both

30
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:51,510
clearance and volume
of distribution.

31
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:58,570
What do we use this
for? It is an indicator

32
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:01,670
of the time required
to reach steady state,

33
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:06,050
that dynamic equilibrium
point, the time

34
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:08,670
required for drug to be
removed from the body,

35
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:13,190
and a way to
estimate the dosing

36
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,230
interval. How often
do we want to be

37
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:19,430
giving a particular
drug to the patient

38
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:22,870
to maintain the
levels within

39
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:25,390
the therapeutic
concentration range?

40
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:28,410
Half-life depends
on both the rate of

41
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:30,030
elimination and volume
of distribution.

42
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:32,250
That can never be
said too often.

43
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:41,130
First order elimination
and zero order

44
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,410
elimination. Zero
order elimination is

45
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:46,810
frequently called
capacity limited because

46
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:51,430
the capacity has
been reached and

47
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:53,990
therefore we get zero
order elimination.

48
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:59,530
But first order,

49
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,970
as I said before,
the vast majority of

50
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:07,950
drugs in therapeutic
concentrations exhibit

51
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:10,670
first-order elimination
kinetics. A constant

52
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:13,310
proportion or a
fraction of the drug

53
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:17,250
is eliminated in a
given amount of time.

54
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,730
These drugs, drugs with

55
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,250
first-order elimination,

56
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:24,590
demonstrate linear
elimination.

57
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:30,010
The rate of drug
metabolism is

58
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:32,050
directly proportional
to the free drug

59
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,290
concentration, of
course, and the

60
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:38,630
fraction that is
removed is constant.

61
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:43,240
Talking about
constant rate

62
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,710
of removal of the drug.

63
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:58,180
Time points at
which blood samples

64
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,380
were taken and drug
levels measured.

65
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,720
This is exactly the same,

66
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,500
but it is on
semi-log paper.

67
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,580
concentrations are
in logs the log dose

68
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,200
and that just
straightens out the slope

69
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:20,680
it is otherwise
identical in this example

70
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:29,820
I'll use this example
here there There is

71
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:37,070
100, whatever it is,
100 units, 100%, and

72
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:47,440
50% occurs at this
point, and this point

73
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,520
is 4 hours.

74
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,280
So the drug
concentration has been

75
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:59,500
reduced by one half
in four hours. So the

76
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,240
half-life of this
drug is four hours.

77
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,000
So let's say this
is 100 milligrams

78
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,780
because I want
to make a point.

79
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,620
Let's say this
is 50 milligrams,

80
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:14,260
half of it, of course.

81
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,200
Well, in another
four hours, so

82
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,140
that would be this
point right here,

83
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,880
sorry my what

84
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,770
is this this is like
right about here

85
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:37,530
so that would be 25
25 milligrams still

86
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:41,790
one half but a
different number of

87
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:47,090
milligrams and another
four hours it's going

88
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:49,590
to be 12 and a half,
and another four

89
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:52,570
hours is going to be
six and a quarter.

90
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,410
Half, half, half, half,

91
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:57,090
half, that's constant.

92
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,730
It is the number
of milligrams

93
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:03,470
that actually go out
that is decreasing

94
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:06,190
by half with
each half-life.

95
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,770
Zero-order kinetics,
or capacity

96
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:15,770
-limited kinetics, means
that the clearance

97
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:18,190
mechanisms have
become saturated.

98
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,350
Let's say they're
enzymes. Let's say they're

99
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:25,210
hepatic enzymes and
those enzymes are

100
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:30,270
all busy. They all
are metabolizing drug.

101
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:36,870
The maximum velocity
has been reached.

102
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:41,270
Those enzymes
cannot metabolize

103
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,730
drug any faster
than they're doing.

104
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,550
As the dosing
rate approaches

105
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:52,570
Vmax, maximum velocity,

106
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:55,630
the dosing
rate approaches

107
00:06:55,630 --> 00:07:00,050
zero, a disproportionate
increase

108
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:03,010
in concentration
will occur.

109
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:04,570
However,

110
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:09,030
if the drug is
continued to be given,

111
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,530
here's our therapeutic
range, and the dosing

112
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:18,550
continues beyond
the capacity,

113
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,950
it's just going
to go up, up, up,

114
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:26,730
up, up, because
the metabolism

115
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:31,590
capacity can only go
as fast as it can go.

116
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:36,850
So when the concentration
is way above

117
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:41,030
Km, this is the
Macaulay's constant, which

118
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:43,750
is the half-maximal,
the concentration at

119
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,410
which the half-maximal
velocity occurs.

120
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:50,350
So when the concentration
is way up here,

121
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:55,390
we are approaching
Vmax, and we're going to

122
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:58,890
be seeing the zero-order
kinetics. Now let's

123
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:02,850
say the drug
administration is stopped.

124
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:07,590
The drug is going
to be gradually

125
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:10,350
cleared out based
on however fast the

126
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:14,650
clearance mechanisms
can can clear it out

127
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:16,750
and the concentration
in the blood is

128
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:21,010
going to go down
gradually over time.

129
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:24,710
And when the
concentration gets down to

130
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:30,350
here, below Km,
then we're going to

131
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:33,490
start to see first
order again. Because

132
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:38,370
now the enzymes of
metabolism are not

133
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:40,870
at capacity. There's
plenty left over.

134
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:50,190
This plot shows,
this is on, the

135
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:54,460
concentration is in
logarithmic, it's

136
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,880
recorded as logarithmic
concentrations.

137
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,720
The, we see
the zero order

138
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:10,420
until the enzymes
of metabolism

139
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:14,400
become freer,
they're no longer at

140
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,700
maximum velocity,
then we get our first

141
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,980
order kinetics
right here in this,

142
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:23,500
according to this
graph in this range.

143
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,180
Saturable elimination,
here are clinical

144
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:35,880
correlates. Why do we
care? If the dosing rate

145
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,420
exceeds the elimination
capacity, steady

146
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,320
state cannot be achieved.
The concentration

147
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,180
will keep rising as long
as dosing continues.

148
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,280
Changing the
dosing rate for a

149
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,000
drug with non
-linear kinetics

150
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,500
is difficult and
unpredictable.

151
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:58,840
With first order, it's
easy. So let's say we

152
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:03,680
have a particular
plasma concentration and

153
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:06,840
it's too low, it's
below the therapeutic

154
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,000
range we want to say
double the dose to get it

155
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,800
into therapeutic range
we will double the

156
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,360
concentration double
the concentration double

157
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:22,100
the dose that's linear
with drugs that are

158
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:25,780
at uh will have
zero order kinetics

159
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:28,300
and there are a few
which i've listed

160
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:32,520
here but in the
toxicity range,

161
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,100
drugs that normally
have first-order

162
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:40,320
kinetics may start
exhibiting zero-order

163
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,300
kinetics, so as
with drug overdoses.

164
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:50,780
So with our
drugs that have

165
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:54,000
zero-order kinetics
at therapeutic

166
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,160
doses, and we'll
use phenytoin as the

167
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,180
example, This is an
anti-seizure drug.

168
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:05,060
Let's say the
concentration is

169
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,540
below the desirable
concentration

170
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:11,020
for preventing seizures.

171
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:16,760
And let's say
it's here. And the

172
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,260
concentration that's
desired is here, which

173
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:23,650
would possibly be
double. If this were

174
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,820
first order, you could
double the concentration,

175
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:27,820
double the dose,
get double the

176
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,780
concentration, but
not with zero order.

177
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:34,600
You might end up
going way over, so

178
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,420
it has to be done
very carefully.

179
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:40,800
Most drug elimination
pathways become

180
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,240
saturated if the
dose is high enough.

181
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,900
We're talking overdose.

182
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,240
Multi-dose kinetics now.

183
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,160
This very simple
figure shows

184
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,280
that with
continuous dosing,

185
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:04,840
it takes, this
is 100% now, so

186
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,480
this is steady
state right up here,

187
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:13,880
it takes four half
-lives to get to

188
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,460
right here. This is
94% of steady state.

189
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:23,420
And at this point,
full therapeutic

190
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:28,040
effect will be
seen, full clinical

191
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,920
response. So we
talk about four half

192
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,500
-lives as approaching
steady state.

193
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,770
It takes five half
-lives to get to 97%,

194
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,420
And we see it's six half
-lives who are already

195
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:47,420
nicely at that plateau
at steady state.

196
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,640
Four half-lives
to approach steady

197
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,940
state, and we will
be seeing a full

198
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,760
clinical response
at that point.

199
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:03,820
Once the drug is stopped,
it's going to take

200
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:09,860
the same number of
half-lives to eliminate

201
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:14,300
the drug. For half
-lives, it's 94%

202
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:18,080
eliminated and this is
the asymptote down here.

203
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,480
And there will be no

204
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,500
observable
clinical response.

205
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,320
On this figure,
this smooth

206
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:35,260
line, would be IV
administration.

207
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:39,550
Nice smooth line.
It still takes about

208
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,160
four half-lives
to approach steady

209
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,760
state to that full
therapeutic effect.

210
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,680
If we are giving it by

211
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,360
intervals, so
interval dosing,

212
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,720
it goes still

213
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:08,930
the The mean is
right here for half

214
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:11,810
-lives to approach
steady state.

215
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:15,490
Drug accumulation
with a continuous or

216
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:18,270
intermittent dosing
rate is based on

217
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:21,010
the fundamental
principle of clearance.

218
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:26,310
Clearance is the
volume of blood from

219
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:29,150
which a drug is removed
per unit of time.

220
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:32,210
Clearance relates
the rate of

221
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:34,590
elimination to the
plasma concentration.

222
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:38,310
So the dosing rate
equals clearance times

223
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:42,910
plasma concentration
and if it's oral we have

224
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,940
to be thinking about
the bioavailability.

225
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:47,290
We always think about

226
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:50,550
bioavailability
but IV F equals 1.

227
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:54,490
Clearance of a
particular drug remains

228
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:56,810
constant although
the The actual amount

229
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:59,070
of drug in the
clearance volume varies

230
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:01,220
with the plasma
drug concentration.

231
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,970
If it's a 100
milligram dose that's

232
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:08,130
going in, and
50% of that is

233
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:10,470
50 milligrams,
it's still a half.

234
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:15,010
Or if it is 20
milligrams going in,

235
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:19,130
10 milligrams comes
out in one half-life.

236
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,910
It's still one half.

237
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,370
steady state is
the rate of drug

238
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:30,530
elimination equals
the rate of drug

239
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:34,590
administration
this plateau right

240
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:37,130
here in the
therapeutic range so

241
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:47,900
let's optimize our
dosage our regiments

242
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:51,550
our drug regiments
using the target

243
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:55,210
concentration strategy
based on this concept.

244
00:15:55,930 --> 00:16:01,210
Dose produces a
concentration in

245
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,170
plasma, which produces
a concentration

246
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:06,530
at the effectocyte,
which produces a

247
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:09,890
particular effect,
the size of the

248
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:12,350
effect, the intensity
of the effect.

249
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:17,270
So the basis of target
concentration strategy

250
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:20,470
is the assumption that
the target concentration

251
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:23,970
will produce the
therapeutic effect.

252
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:28,770
The therapeutic goal
is to maintain the

253
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,630
steady-state drug
levels within the

254
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:34,470
therapeutic range to
provide efficacy with

255
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:37,790
minimum toxicity. So
this is optimizing.

256
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:41,970
Optimizing our
drug therapy.

257
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:48,160
Target concentration
strategy means a

258
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:51,230
desired steady state
concentration is

259
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:53,850
selected and that's
looked up in the

260
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:55,870
drug monographs.
That'll tell you what

261
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:59,250
the desired concentration
should be and

262
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:04,310
therefore a dose is
calculated that will

263
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:07,350
be predicted to
achieve this value.

264
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:13,730
But not all patients
are the same. So

265
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:15,930
the standard dose in
the healthy individual

266
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:19,070
may not be right
for everybody. In

267
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:21,150
fact will not be
right for everybody.

268
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:25,320
Physiologic and
pathologic processes

269
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,570
may be applied to dose

270
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:30,170
adjustment in the
individual patient.

271
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:35,190
Drug concentrations
may guide dose changes.

272
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:40,690
And we remember that
the concentrations have

273
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:45,310
to be related to the
therapeutic effect.

274
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:52,870
This figure shows
a nice therapeutic

275
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:54,970
window here in
the shaded area.

276
00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:00,490
The top is the minimum
toxic concentration.

277
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:02,840
The bottom is the
minimum effective

278
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,550
concentration. It'd be
nice to stay in here,

279
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,830
like right in here
would be really good.

280
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:14,810
This shows you the
intermittent dosing so

281
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:18,150
that peak concentration
does not go above

282
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:22,350
that minimum toxic
concentration and does

283
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:25,470
not drop below the
minimum effective

284
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:29,110
concentration. Another
dose, another dose, etc.

285
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:31,010
It stays right there in

286
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,310
that therapeutic window.

287
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,030
this is referred
to as the peak

288
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:40,770
concentration this is
referred to as the trough

289
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:45,270
concentration
trough concentration

290
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:50,290
the lowest concentration
taken just before

291
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:53,110
the next dose would
be administered.

292
00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:01,370
Now, when we are taking
our blood samples,

293
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:05,050
we need to take them
properly. If we're

294
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:07,150
taking a trough
concentration, it must

295
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:09,410
be a true trough
concentration. It can't

296
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:12,290
be like right here
because that will give

297
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:15,390
us a false impression
of where we are.

298
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:20,810
So let's
calculate loading

299
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:22,790
dose and
maintenance. dose.

300
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:26,230
Loading dose, volume
of distribution

301
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:30,130
times the desired
concentration.

302
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:34,490
Dose equals the volume
of distribution times

303
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:37,790
the desired
concentration. The desired

304
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:41,830
concentration would be the
concentration at steady

305
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:44,890
state. And of course
we need to factor in

306
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:48,220
our bioavailability.
So the loading dose

307
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,130
relates the amount of
drug in the body to the

308
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:53,590
drug concentration
in plasma. This is a

309
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:58,190
situation in which the
patient has no drug on

310
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:02,130
board. What happens when
we give a first dose?

311
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,970
Well, it's going
to distribute

312
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:07,770
to wherever it
distributes.

313
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:10,030
Distribute to
the tissues,

314
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:12,990
it moves into the volume.

315
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:16,310
And that's why we
think about volume of

316
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:18,710
distribution for the
loading dose when the

317
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:20,870
patient doesn't have
any drug on board.

318
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:26,770
Now the maintenance
dose, so dose equals

319
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:30,150
the clearance times
the concentration,

320
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,450
or in this case
concentration

321
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:34,550
times clearance
is the same thing,

322
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:38,880
clearance times
concentration, factoring

323
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:45,370
in the bioavailability.
So why Why

324
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:47,660
don't we think about
volume here because

325
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:53,010
the patient will
be at steady state.

326
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:55,070
We want to keep them
at steady state.

327
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:59,450
So it's already in a
dynamic equilibrium.

328
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,590
It's already moved
into the volume

329
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:06,190
and now it's in a
dynamic equilibrium

330
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:07,990
between the blood
and the tissues.

331
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:12,550
So why don't we
factor in clearance

332
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:15,390
with loading
dose? because it's

333
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:18,120
got to get to the
volume first before

334
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:20,730
it establishes
that equilibrium.

335
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:25,990
So maintenance dose
relates the dosing

336
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:27,870
rate to the rate
of elimination at

337
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,530
steady state. Rate
in equals rate out.

338
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:37,590
This figure shows
us the value of

339
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:39,790
using a loading
dose. It brings the

340
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:42,110
concentration
right up to the

341
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:44,690
approximate steady
-state concentration.

342
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:48,170
The maintenance dose
is started right away,

343
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:52,390
and it will take
the four half

344
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:54,130
-lives to approach
steady-state

345
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:56,570
and full
therapeutic effect.

346
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:01,430
Loading dose is
going to be bigger

347
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:03,210
than the
maintenance dose, do

348
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,580
I want to point
out here. This

349
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,240
is everything
I've just said.

350
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,380
now when do we use
loading dose that's

351
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:17,760
that's the question do
we have to always use

352
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,920
loading dose no loading
dose may be desirable

353
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,180
when the state of
the steady state

354
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:28,660
concentration should
rapidly be reached a

355
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:33,060
patient is in an emergent
situation and needs

356
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,660
the full effect of
the drug right away

357
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:42,120
other situations that
maybe a loading dose

358
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:45,680
would be useful is
when the half-life is

359
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:49,100
really really long and
want to get the doses

360
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:53,440
up prior to waiting
for a week or two weeks

361
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:57,660
but not loading dose
doesn't always have

362
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:01,340
to be given it depends
on the situation so

363
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:10,360
here's an example
this is an example of

364
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:14,600
theophylline. Theophylline
is a useful drug for

365
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:19,180
causing bronchodilation
and helping people

366
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:22,680
with acute asthma attack
breathe. It is not

367
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:26,420
used very often because
we now have inhalers

368
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:29,760
that will do the same
thing. It is a very

369
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,820
effective drug with
a narrow therapeutic

370
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:36,060
window and potential for
significant toxicity.

371
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:39,340
But this is the example
that is in basic and

372
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:42,140
clinical pharmacology
and has been an example

373
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:44,540
used for many, many,
many, many decades.

374
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,020
So the avalan volume
of distribution

375
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,760
is 35 liters for
a 70-kilogram

376
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,800
person. So we'll use
our example of a 70

377
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,200
-kilogram person.
We need to always

378
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,240
factor in the weight
of the person.

379
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:04,820
The weight can
be ideal body

380
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:07,800
weight, actual
body weight.

381
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:11,420
What do we do for
an obese person?

382
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,620
That's an area
of investigation.

383
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:17,220
Right now, it's
still quite difficult

384
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:22,540
to determine the
correct dosage

385
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:24,740
for an obese person.
There are some

386
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:27,460
guidelines for it,
for some drugs.

387
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,760
So that's an aside.

388
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,900
volume of distribution
35 liters for

389
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:38,570
a 70 kilogram person
we'd like to bring

390
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:41,020
the blood levels
up to 10 milligrams

391
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:49,100
per liter and this
is a monograph drug

392
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:54,920
monograph so I
looked it up I mean I

393
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,760
didn't I took I did
double check what

394
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,320
basic and clinical
pharmacology said.

395
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:04,700
And this is also
from the drug

396
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,340
monograph from
the tables.

397
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,160
This is an
intravenous drug

398
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:13,860
so bioavailability
equals 1.

399
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:20,460
Loading dose, volume
times concentration,

400
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,160
desired concentration,
the volume

401
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,220
of distribution times
the concentration

402
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:29,480
that we want, divided
by 1 in this case,

403
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:33,720
and we come up
with 350 milligrams

404
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,660
intravenously for a
70 kilogram person.

405
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,880
Just plugging
in the numbers.

406
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:43,130
Now we have to be
thinking about when

407
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:44,640
what's happening
when we give a

408
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,440
loading dose, especially
intravenously.

409
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:52,600
Well, it can shoot
up to toxicity

410
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,860
concentration for people

411
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,580
who are particularly
sensitive.

412
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:00,680
An excessive
concentration may take

413
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:03,560
a long time to
fall if the drug

414
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,480
happens to have
a long half-life.

415
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:09,280
And toxic effects
may result from

416
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,080
actions at the
undesirable sites. Not all

417
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,700
drugs are so selective
that they act

418
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:20,040
on only one therapeutic,
only one target,

419
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,540
and that's the
therapeutic target.

420
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,840
Loading doses tend to be

421
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,440
large based
on this volume

422
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,600
of distribution
at steady state.

423
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,940
Rapid administration,

424
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:39,880
rapid IV administration,
that drug

425
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:46,160
level can rapidly
shoot up like that

426
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:52,060
and that can cause
some toxicities.

427
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:57,920
So let's talk now
about the maintenance

428
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,860
dose for this same
theophylline example.

429
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,400
The maintenance
dose is administered

430
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,120
after the loading
dose is given to

431
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,860
maintain the plasma
level within the

432
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:08,780
therapeutic concentration
which we saw

433
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:13,540
on this diagram in
a previous slide.

434
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,260
So let's say the
patient is being is

435
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:23,340
given IV maintenance
and that's going

436
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:27,740
to be clearance
times the desired

437
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:33,120
concentration and it's
IV so my availability

438
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,820
is 1. All right
where did I get

439
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,780
this clearance
number from a table.

440
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:45,540
Notice that it is
clearance for a

441
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:48,520
70 kilogram
individual. If this

442
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:52,680
person were 50
kilograms that would

443
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,960
have to be factored
in an adult.

444
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:59,560
So working it out
it's 28 milligrams

445
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:03,160
per hour for the
70 kilogram person.

446
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:05,460
But we're not
going to send the

447
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:08,080
patient home on an
intravenous drug

448
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,640
when we can give
them an oral.

449
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:13,260
So we want to switch.
So the maintenance

450
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:18,000
dose is the same
calculation, factoring in

451
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,520
the bioavailability
of the oral dose and

452
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,540
then we want to
think about how

453
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,680
frequently are we
giving the drug.

454
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:32,620
Theophylline oral
bioavailability is 0

455
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:37,780
.96. Yes, that's nearly
100%. And yes, in

456
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:41,140
reality, we would
just treat it as

457
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,560
bioavailability one, but
we want to make a point.

458
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:48,470
And this is what if
the bioavailability

459
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:52,680
is 0.33 as we saw
with the verapamil.

460
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:59,080
So the drug, the
patient's going

461
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:03,340
to be sent home
on an extended

462
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:06,000
-release theophylline
every 12 hours.

463
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,380
So there are other
choices. That's a

464
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,960
decision that was
made for this example

465
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,580
in basic and clinical
pharmacology.

466
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:18,440
So we plug in
the numbers. It

467
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:31,560
comes out to 26.88
milligrams per hour.

468
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,480
Well, they're not
taking the tablet

469
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:39,880
every hour. So that
works out to 322.56

470
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:44,000
milligrams per dose
every 12 hours.

471
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,880
Well, it doesn't
come that

472
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,700
way. So what do we do?

473
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:52,160
Do we ask the
pharmacist to crush

474
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:57,140
the tablet and
figure out 322.56

475
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:59,700
milligrams per dose?
No, of course not.

476
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,780
We use something that's

477
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:03,000
commercially available.

478
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,260
So rounded up in
the case given by

479
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:10,460
basic and clinical
pharmacology,

480
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,140
two 350 milligram
extended-release tablets

481
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:17,460
every 12 hours for this
70 kilogram patient.

482
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:20,180
Very simple math.

483
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:24,520
Theophylline has a
narrow therapeutic window

484
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:28,140
and considerable
interpatient variability,

485
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:34,120
and the serum levels
can be monitored.

486
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:38,420
The assays are
available and reasonably

487
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:42,920
priced, so it makes
sense to monitor the

488
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,520
theophylline levels
and adjust accordingly.

489
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:52,700
Now variabilities,
we've been talking and

490
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:55,760
talking and talking
about this is what

491
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,380
it says in the drug
monograph based on

492
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:01,440
generally healthy, in
people with generally

493
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,040
healthy the elimination
organs, etc.

494
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,560
But what do we
do in patients

495
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,700
who have various
disease states?

496
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:13,670
So I put all of this
in tables talking

497
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:19,200
about the effects on
various parameters.

498
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,640
So absorption
from the GI tract,

499
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,440
that's going to
depend on how soluble

500
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,640
is it in the fluids
in the GI tract.

501
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,860
It's going to
depend on acid-base

502
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:34,780
characteristics. Will it
be destroyed in an acid

503
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:37,220
stomach? Does it
need an acid stomach?

504
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,880
How lipid-soluble is it?

505
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:42,640
Do we need to
give it with food?

506
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,180
Should we give it in
fasting condition?

507
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,620
Can it be given at
the same time as other

508
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:51,820
drugs? What is the
blood flow to the gut?

509
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,680
Will the drug be absorbed

510
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:58,220
and transported
to the liver?

511
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:01,160
What is the GI transit
time? Is it going

512
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,600
to sit in the stomach
for a long time

513
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,020
and move slowly
through the gut, or

514
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,780
is it going to just
fly right through?

515
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:13,000
What is the functional
capacity of the

516
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,440
organs of elimination,
the liver and kidney?

517
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:22,140
Does the patient
have heart failure

518
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,240
or shock that's
going to decrease the

519
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,740
perfusion to the
liver or kidneys?

520
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:29,500
If the perfusion is
decreased, the drug

521
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:32,160
is going to be
delivered to the

522
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,740
organs of elimination
at a slower rate.

523
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,860
What's the volume
of distribution?

524
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,700
Does the patient have
edema or ascites?

525
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,560
If so, the total
body water is up.

526
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:50,040
And hydrophilic
drugs that

527
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,720
distribute in body
water are going

528
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,860
to need to be
carefully dosed.

529
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,280
What's the plasma
protein situation?

530
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:02,220
What's the tissue
binding situation of

531
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,160
the drugs? What's
the skeletal muscle

532
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,700
mass? Does the
patient have obesity?

533
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,080
If obese,

534
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,600
the volume of
distribution

535
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,680
for lipophilic
drugs goes up.

536
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:17,400
Aging. Decreased
muscle mass, decreased

537
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:20,540
distribution can
decrease the half-life.

538
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:24,660
We talked about
obesity. It's going to

539
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:27,840
distribute to the
adipocytes and it will

540
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,720
be sequestered in
the adipocytes and

541
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,760
therefore the half-life
can go up as it takes

542
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,600
time for the drug
to distribute back

543
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,860
out of the adipocytes
and be eliminated.

544
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,100
And pathologic
fluid, we mentioned

545
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:46,780
edema and ascites,
that can increase the

546
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:49,620
half-life of the
hydrophilic drugs.

547
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,560
Clearance mechanisms.

548
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:56,580
what's the capacity
of the cytochrome

549
00:33:56,580 --> 00:34:02,240
p450s has the enzyme
of elimination been

550
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,120
induced so there's an
increased metabolic

551
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,200
rate that's going
to increase the

552
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,800
elimination rate
increase the clearance so

553
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,060
increased rate of
elimination so increased

554
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:16,920
clearance is going
to decrease the half

555
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,740
-life and reduce the
therapeutic effect.

556
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:24,920
Conversely, if the
enzymes of elimination

557
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:29,180
are inhibited, that's
going to decrease

558
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:32,120
the rate of metabolism
and decrease

559
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,440
clearance. So, decrease
clearance, increase

560
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,440
half-life. The drug
can accumulate and

561
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,550
that can increase
the risk of toxicity.

562
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:42,280
Cardiac failure, well,

563
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,140
we're decreasing
perfusion.

564
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:47,760
Hepatic failure, we're
decreasing clearance

565
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,640
because the liver is
not functioning well.

566
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,640
Renal failure, same
thing. The kidneys

567
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:56,140
are not functioning
well and therefore half

568
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:58,330
-life will go up in all
of these situations.

569
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,920
I'm sure you have
observed that

570
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:04,880
volume of distribution
and half-life are

571
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,780
directly proportional,
whereas clearance

572
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:10,240
and half-life are
inversely proportional.

573
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,320
Pharmacodynamic
variables. There

574
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,860
are a couple here.
Maximum effect

575
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,580
attainable in the
target tissue,

576
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:21,460
sensitivity of the
tissue to the drug.

577
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:25,820
The pharmacokinetic
variables far surpass

578
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:28,620
the pharmacodynamic
variables which

579
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:30,240
is not to say we
ignore them. Of

580
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,870
course not. But we
must be very careful to

581
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:37,760
properly dose our
individual patient

582
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:42,280
in order to
achieve the desired

583
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:45,560
therapeutic effect with
minimal toxicities.

584
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,560
So individualizing
drug therapy.

585
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:54,000
The benefits of
drug therapy should

586
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,700
always outweigh the
risk. The therapy

587
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,960
should be as
simplified as possible.

588
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:01,960
Genetics play a role
in the interpatient

589
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,200
variability to
drug response.

590
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,760
Prescribers should
be thoroughly

591
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,760
familiar with the
drugs that they

592
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:12,840
use and to use a
limited number.

593
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:16,860
All the rest
you can look up.

594
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,260
You need to educate
the patient on

595
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:22,420
the disease and
treatment. And you need

596
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:25,060
to be thinking about
shared decision

597
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:29,460
-making between you
and the patient.

598
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,980
And what's the
point of therapy?

599
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,700
It's the goal of therapy.

600
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:40,540
You need a therapeutic
objective. This is

601
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:43,140
the reason why you're
giving the therapy.

602
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:46,700
Choose drug therapy
on the patient

603
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:49,500
characteristics in clinical
presentation. determine

604
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,500
the appropriate dose
and dosing schedule.

605
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,700
Electronic medical
records and pharmacy

606
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:58,000
systems increasingly
incorporate

607
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,740
prescribing information,
such as unindicated

608
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:04,360
medications being
prescribed, potential

609
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,340
dosing errors,
drug interactions,

610
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,040
genetically determined
drug responses.

611
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,880
Please do not blow
through those. Look

612
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,480
at them, think
about them, and be

613
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,180
familiar with all of
these various flags

614
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:22,380
that can come up in
electronic medical

615
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:24,180
records and what
they're telling you.

616
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,040
Maximizing effect while

617
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,620
minimizing toxicity.

618
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:32,660
Measuring the
concentration of drug and

619
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:36,720
plasma has utility when
there is a relationship

620
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,580
with the concentration
of drug and

621
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:43,040
plasma and the clinical
effect. when there

622
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,580
is an established
target concentration,

623
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,460
significant inter
- and intrapatient

624
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:53,480
variability in
pharmacokinetic properties,

625
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:56,160
when there's a narrow
therapeutic window.

626
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:59,080
And certainly, there

627
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,760
needs to be a reliable,

628
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:04,320
cost-effective assay

629
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,540
available for
clinical use.

630
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:16,130
One well-done drug
concentration,

631
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:19,590
I will put a
box around that,

632
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:22,710
is more valuable
than any algorithm

633
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:25,710
that seeks to predict
concentration or

634
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:27,730
effect using patient
characteristics,

635
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:31,270
comorbidities,
or other factors.

636
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:34,410
Poorly done
therapeutic monitoring

637
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:35,970
may produce
results that are

638
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:38,930
misleading, and in
this way are worse

639
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:40,650
than having no
testing at all.

640
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:45,710
The duration of an
infusion and the

641
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:48,030
correct timing of
the sample after the

642
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:51,030
infusion are
critical to having

643
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:53,170
results that can be
assessed in the light

644
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:55,990
of published data
and guidelines.

645
00:38:56,930 --> 00:39:00,490
The major use of
measured concentrations

646
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:03,010
of drugs at steady
state is to refine the

647
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:07,330
estimated oral clearance
for the patient being

648
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:10,550
treated. For the
patient being treated.

649
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:20,770
So, in summary, this
is a little scheme

650
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:24,110
of everything we've
been talking about.

651
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:28,450
The elimination half
-life is a measure

652
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:30,990
of the time it
takes for the plasma

653
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:33,110
concentration or
the amount of drug

654
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:35,600
in the body to be
reduced by 50%.

655
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:39,430
Half-life is a
function of volume

656
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:41,650
of distribution
and clearance.

657
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:45,750
Half-life elimination
curves track the

658
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:48,250
amount of drug in
the body over time.

659
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:51,350
In first-order
elimination kinetics, the

660
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:53,890
drug elimination rate
is directly proportional

661
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:57,110
to the plasma-free
drug concentration.

662
00:39:57,410 --> 00:40:03,990
And this is the kinetics
pattern of nearly

663
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:08,770
all drugs used with
therapeutic uses.

664
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:11,890
Now, in zero-order
elimination kinetics,

665
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:13,610
the metabolic
enzymes eventually

666
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:16,690
will become saturated
as the concentration

667
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:19,490
of the substrate
increases. And the

668
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:22,210
rate of drug
elimination is constant

669
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:24,410
or a constant amount,
not a fraction.

670
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:28,890
And independent of
plasma concentration.

671
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:32,010
So it's no longer a
half, a half, a half,

672
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:34,970
a half. It would be
whatever rate that

673
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:38,430
those saturated
enzymes are capable of

674
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:42,390
doing. Let's say
it's 2 milligrams per

675
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:45,330
milliliter. 2 milligrams,
2 milligrams, 2

676
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:47,230
milligrams, 2
milligrams, 2 milligrams.

677
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:51,090
And it will
eventually reduce the

678
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:53,290
concentration of
drug in the blood,

679
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:57,750
assuming the drug has
been discontinued.

680
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:00,270
If the drug has not been

681
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:02,330
discontinued,
that concentration

682
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:04,830
can just go up,
up, up, up, up.

683
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:10,530
When a drug that
exhibits first-order

684
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:12,570
pharmacokinetics is
administered to a

685
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:15,130
patient continuously
or intermittently,

686
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:17,110
the drug will
accumulate until it

687
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:19,750
reaches a plateau, a
dynamic equilibrium,

688
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:22,530
which is called
steady-state

689
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:24,730
plasma drug
concentration.

690
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:27,450
The time to
reach the steady

691
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:28,910
state is a
function of the

692
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:30,910
elimination half
-life of the drug.

693
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:34,430
Four half-lives
is 94% steady

694
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:36,930
state concentration
and provides

695
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:39,030
a full therapeutic
effect.

696
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:41,950
If the half-life
or the dosing rate

697
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:45,790
changes, it will again
take four half-lives

698
00:41:45,790 --> 00:41:48,570
to approach the new
steady state plasma

699
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:52,410
concentration. The
therapeutic goal

700
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:55,990
of the target
concentration strategy is

701
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:59,510
to maintain steady
-state levels within

702
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:03,750
the therapeutic
range to provide

703
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:08,290
therapeutic efficacy
with minimum toxicity.

704
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:14,810
This approach links
pharmacokinetics

705
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:16,270
and pharmacodynamics.

706
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:21,290
A loading dose
rapidly raises

707
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:22,850
the plasma drug
concentration

708
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:24,630
to the target
concentration.

709
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:27,290
The volume of
distribution relates

710
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:28,830
the total amount
of drug in the

711
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:31,530
body to the plasma
concentration.

712
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:34,950
The maintenance dose
is administered after

713
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:38,090
or even at the same
time as the loading

714
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:40,690
dose to maintain the
desired steady state

715
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:43,950
concentration. The
maintenance dose

716
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:47,030
equals the clearance
times the concentration,

717
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:49,980
divided again by
the bioavailability.

718
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:54,150
Disease states may
modify pharmacokinetic

719
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:56,490
parameters and
pharmacodynamic

720
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:59,270
actions in response
to drug therapy.

721
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:03,670
Optimization is
based on in-depth

722
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:06,290
understanding of factors
that determine an

723
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:08,950
individual's response
to drug treatment.

724
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:13,970
Know your drugs that
you use all the time.

725
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:16,950
Fundamental
principles should

726
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:19,930
guide prescribing
of drugs.

727
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,750
Here's a little
flow chart

728
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:27,150
if you want
to look at it.

729
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:31,010
Suggested method
of design for

730
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:32,930
a rational drug
dosing regimen.

731
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:37,470
And that concludes
the lectures

732
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:39,870
on clinical
pharmacokinetics.
