1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:01,900
Welcome, students, to

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:03,880
Clinical
Pharmacokinetics.

3
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:07,140
This is the clinical
application of

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,620
pharmacokinetics
for rational dosing

5
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:12,120
and the time course
of drug action.

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,280
This screen says part

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,540
one. There is a part two.

8
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:21,520
Really, it is one
lecture that takes longer

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,320
than 50 minutes
because of the content.

10
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:28,840
And all the concepts
are interrelated.

11
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,720
Please contact
me if you'd like

12
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,180
to chat about
pharmacology.

13
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,060
Learning objectives.

14
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,040
These are the concepts
that you need to know

15
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,140
to understand clinical
pharmacokinetics.

16
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,280
Practice questions. I

17
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,260
highly, highly recommend.

18
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,780
I've included required
here. students

19
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:01,160
over the years have
told me how helpful

20
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,760
they are not only
for helping you learn

21
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,420
pharmacology but
also for the boards.

22
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,880
Some suggestions
on effective

23
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,640
learning strategies.

24
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:17,820
There are resources if

25
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:18,900
you wish to use them.

26
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,940
A rational approach
to achieving a

27
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:28,900
desired beneficial
effect with minimum

28
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,820
adverse effects.
That's optimization of

29
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,060
therapy for your
individual patient.

30
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,100
The drug monographs
have starting points

31
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,080
but you will need
to understand these

32
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,420
basic pharmacokinetic
concepts, these

33
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:47,600
fundamental pharmacokinetic
concepts in order

34
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,380
to optimize for your
particular patient.

35
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,240
This figure
represents the

36
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,340
interrelationship
between all of the

37
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,000
pharmacokinetic
parameters, administration,

38
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,840
absorption, distribution,

39
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:09,320
elimination, either
as metabolism or

40
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:15,240
excretion, and the
amount of drug that gets

41
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,120
to the site of
action to produce its

42
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,160
clinical effect. And
a clinical response

43
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,220
can be effectiveness,
certainly that's

44
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,380
what we're looking
for, but it can also

45
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,920
include toxicity.
These are mechanisms

46
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:38,060
of action and
mechanisms of toxicity.

47
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,180
So when I talk
about mechanisms,

48
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,860
mechanisms, mechanisms, I

49
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,180
mean all of
these mechanisms,

50
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,140
pharmacokinetic and
pharmacodynamic.

51
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,500
What you need to
know and understand,

52
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,880
I'm not going to go
through each of these.

53
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:00,520
I put these tables
here to help you.

54
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,460
It really is a
learning tool to help

55
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:07,790
remind you of what
these concepts are.

56
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:11,040
You will need to
understand all of these

57
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,620
concepts in order
to be able to apply

58
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:18,080
pharmacokinetic
fundamentals to dosing.

59
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,280
Some more, plenty plenty

60
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,900
of fundamental concepts

61
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:32,490
and more.

62
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:39,430
These really are
all relationships.

63
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:42,530
I'm not going
to ask you to

64
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:47,210
calculate anything
except loading dose

65
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:49,890
and maintenance
dose. These you will

66
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:52,350
need to know how
to calculate. The

67
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:55,170
others are relationships,
meaning that

68
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:58,790
the parameters are
related to each

69
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:01,580
other, either
directly or inversely.

70
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,450
So please Always
look at all of

71
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:07,570
those equations
as relationships.

72
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,930
And some more terms
that you'll need to

73
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:19,210
understand when you're
talking pharmacology to

74
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:22,470
each other as students
and as practitioners.

75
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,220
Here are some
variables, so we look

76
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:30,930
into the drug
monographs to get some

77
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:33,110
pharmacokinetic
information and of

78
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:35,390
course pharmacodynamic
information too.

79
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:43,760
These listings in the
monographs are for

80
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,930
patients with normal
renal function,

81
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:53,110
normal liver function,
and many patients

82
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:56,140
have conditions
that can change the

83
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,970
parameters. And that's
what you need to be

84
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,970
able to understand
when you read the

85
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:06,570
pharmacokinetics in
the drug monographs.

86
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:09,790
Fortunately, they
include renal

87
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:13,390
dosing, hepatic
dosing, so

88
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,050
that you don't
have to guess.

89
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,570
I'm going to talk
a moment about

90
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,450
therapeutic
drug monitoring.

91
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:29,350
so we think okay I
can tell if my patient

92
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:32,550
has the right amount of
drug just by measuring

93
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:35,390
it in the bloodstream
well yes we can

94
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:38,230
do that for a number
of drugs and it is

95
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:41,450
helpful but we can't
do it for every drug

96
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:45,090
for example if a
person is taking an

97
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:48,370
antihypertensive for blood
pressure we just nearly

98
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:51,570
merely need to measure
the blood pressure

99
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:54,670
to see if the drug is
effective For other

100
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:59,110
drugs, we can measure
the blood levels.

101
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:02,650
But this is good
only when there is a

102
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:04,670
relationship between
the concentration

103
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:07,530
of drug in the plasma
and the effect.

104
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:14,130
If there is
significant variability

105
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:18,490
between patients and
within one patient,

106
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,830
if there is
an established

107
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:24,030
drug target
concentration.

108
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,710
If there isn't, we
can get our drug

109
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:29,910
concentration level
back, but what

110
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:31,630
do we do with it
if we don't know

111
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:34,510
what the target
concentration is?

112
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:37,970
Drugs with a narrow
therapeutic window,

113
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:42,830
so they have a
potential for

114
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:45,790
getting up into
toxicity zone.

115
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,350
So we can,

116
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:51,630
assuming all of
these other features,

117
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:57,950
then we can
avoid toxicity,

118
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,110
hopefully, in the
individual patient

119
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:01,670
by measuring the
blood levels.

120
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,510
Excuse me, I pushed
the wrong button.

121
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:09,570
And all of this
is fine only if

122
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:11,610
there is a reliable,
cost-effective

123
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:13,690
drug assay for
clinical use.

124
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,090
If not, we're
not going to be

125
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:18,730
able to measure
the drug levels.

126
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:23,630
So, in summary,

127
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:28,550
only clinically
meaningful when the

128
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:31,150
efficacy of a drug
treatment can be enhanced

129
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:34,590
by achieving a certain
concentration or

130
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:38,170
effect range, and
or toxicity of drug

131
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:40,430
therapy could be
reduced by maintaining

132
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:43,910
a certain concentration
or effect range.

133
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,950
That's when we use it.

134
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,180
Some fundamental
principles that

135
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,660
I'm actually
going to go over

136
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:59,420
with you. Benefit
versus risk.

137
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:04,700
The benefit must always
outweigh the risk.

138
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:07,580
We're not going
to use a toxic

139
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:10,560
chemotherapy for
a minor problem.

140
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,060
However,

141
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,760
a toxic
chemotherapy may be

142
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,540
appropriate for
a cancer patient

143
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,540
who would die
without treatment.

144
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:26,020
Dosing. The smallest
dose necessary to produce

145
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:29,440
the desired effect.
Remember the concept

146
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,620
of the dose determines
the concentration

147
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:36,200
in the blood, which
determines the concentration

148
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,320
at the effector site,
which determines

149
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,900
the magnitude of the
effect. So the smallest

150
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,460
dose necessary to
produce the desired

151
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,280
effect. You don't want
to use a dose so small

152
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,860
that there's no observable
clinical effect.

153
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,960
Treatment regimen.

154
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,120
The number of medications
that a patient

155
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,400
is getting and how
many doses per day

156
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,980
the patient is
getting should be

157
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:19,360
minimized to improve
adherence to therapy.

158
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,800
If the

159
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,140
therapeutic regimen
is complicated

160
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:28,420
by lots of
medications and lots

161
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,900
of doses, patients
are not going

162
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,720
to want to be on
those therapies.

163
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,300
Furthermore, the
more medications

164
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,520
a patient takes,
the more potential

165
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,820
for drug
interactions and more

166
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:45,060
potential for
adverse drug events.

167
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,400
Now changing
drug regimens, we

168
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,000
need to be
careful with that.

169
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:56,100
Many drugs need to be
cautiously reduced in

170
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,400
dosage over time.
Many drugs need to be

171
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:05,300
cautiously increased
in dosage over time to

172
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:10,300
prevent the adverse
reactions that
abrupt withdrawal

173
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:15,160
or starting with
high doses may cause.

174
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,020
We always need to
be thinking about

175
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,300
the potential drug
-drug interactions

176
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,700
and drug-disease
interactions.

177
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,460
Now, people are
different, and

178
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,860
genetics may play a
role in determining

179
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,080
the variability
in drug response.

180
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:40,280
Some of the pharmacogenomic,
pharmacogenetic

181
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,420
screening tests
are available and

182
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:48,260
are reasonably priced
and are useful.

183
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:52,600
They should be used
when they are useful.

184
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,240
Knowledge.

185
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,220
Well, practitioners
need to keep up with

186
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,060
the literature. But
you're busy, busy,

187
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:05,320
busy, busy, and that's
difficult. So at least

188
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,120
try and keep up
with the guidelines.

189
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,360
These are generally
unbiased opinions from

190
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,580
experts that formulate
these guidelines.

191
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,400
And they provide
a foundation

192
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,920
for decision making.

193
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:24,420
There are some
websites that

194
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:27,080
are excellent,
highly reliable,

195
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,880
like UpToDate
at this point.

196
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:36,220
so be sure you know
the website you're

197
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:40,960
using is reliable and
also if you have time

198
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:45,990
join journal clubs
basically prescribers

199
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:49,440
should only use a
limited number of drugs

200
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,660
with which they are
thoroughly familiar

201
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:56,300
you don't need to
memorize thousands of

202
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,500
drugs we have literature
for that We have

203
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,430
drug monographs that
will tell you all

204
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,580
you need to know about
particular drugs.

205
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:11,640
But within your practice
scope, you should

206
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:15,480
be thoroughly familiar
with the drugs,

207
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,180
what they do,
their mechanisms of

208
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,840
action, their
pharmacokinetic

209
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,820
parameters, and your
experience with their

210
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:26,420
use in a variety
of patients. So

211
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:38,250
let's get into it.
Here are the parameters

212
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,730
that govern drug
disposition, in

213
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:44,530
other words
pharmacokinetics, clearance,

214
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,390
bioavailability,
volume of

215
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,650
distribution,
elimination, half-life.

216
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:52,470
These are considered
the major parameters

217
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:55,690
and area under the
concentration versus

218
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:58,490
time curve and steady
state are related.

219
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:01,570
In fact, all of
these parameters

220
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:03,430
are related
to each other.

221
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:09,610
Let's take a very
simple example.

222
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:11,510
This is Models of Drug

223
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:13,610
Distribution
and Elimination.

224
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,390
If you want to
look into it

225
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,270
further, it is
in the Basic and

226
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,330
Clinical Pharmacology
textbook.

227
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:22,310
I have given
you that link at

228
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:25,130
the beginning
of the lectures.

229
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:29,690
So looking at Panel A,
a very simple example

230
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:34,170
of a one compartment
model. We have the

231
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:38,490
beaker, which is the
container of blood,

232
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:42,250
and we have drug being
introduced into that

233
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:45,970
blood and instantaneously
distributing.

234
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:50,970
On the right side,
we have the y-axis,

235
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:53,030
which is the
concentration of drug

236
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:57,810
in the blood over
time on the x-axis.

237
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:03,310
The drug is introduced
into the blood to

238
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:06,390
a certain peak level
and because there is

239
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:09,690
no outlet there is a
straight line across.

240
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:14,730
Now let's take
the more realistic

241
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:16,810
example where there
is elimination

242
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:18,890
going on at
the same time.

243
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,810
That's indicated here.

244
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:28,430
The drug is introduced
into the blood,

245
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:32,570
immediately
distributes in the

246
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:36,510
volume, and
immediately, well almost

247
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:40,640
immediately, begins
to be eliminated.

248
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:45,750
So drug goes into the
blood, certain peak

249
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:50,210
concentration, and
elimination over time.

250
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,310
drip, drip, drip.

251
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:58,750
Now, a more
realistic model

252
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,310
of a two
-compartment model.

253
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:03,410
Drug goes in,

254
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:08,310
notice that the
elimination valve here is

255
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:13,230
closed, immediately
distributes in the central

256
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:18,200
compartment, the blood,
and then distributes

257
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:23,370
in an equilibrium
to the extravascular

258
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:26,050
volume. So what is the
extravascular volume?

259
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:29,230
That's the interstitial
fluid, and drugs that

260
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:33,930
have the capacity to
cross cellular barriers

261
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:38,150
can also distribute
into cells and tissues.

262
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:44,570
we get a peak then
we get a distribution

263
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:48,070
phase and because
the elimination valve

264
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:51,530
is closed we get
a plateau here but

265
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:56,600
that's not what happens
in our bodies we

266
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:59,210
put drug into our
body and as it passes

267
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:02,890
by the liver it gets
metabolized eliminated

268
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:06,350
by a metabolism as
it passes by the

269
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:08,930
kidneys it gets
excreted in the kidneys.

270
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:14,190
We get drug in,

271
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:17,490
distribution,
drug out, peak,

272
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:20,770
the distribution
phase, and

273
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:22,830
then the
elimination phase.

274
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:26,370
That's a basic concept.
That's what happens

275
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:28,870
with drugs. This is
a very simple model

276
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:31,950
but it's easy to
see what's going on.

277
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:39,270
Of course, we're
not just two models.

278
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,250
This is a picture of
a multi-compartment

279
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,310
model where the
drug goes into the

280
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:48,930
blood, distributes to
the vessel-rich group

281
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:52,310
like the brain and
the viscera, then

282
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:57,510
more slowly distributes
to the muscle mass

283
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:59,890
and even more slowly
to the fat mass.

284
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:03,910
Before administration, in

285
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,790
this figure,
there is no drug.

286
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:10,710
Immediately after
administration, as it goes

287
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:14,230
to the vessel-rich
group, the brain and

288
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:17,150
viscera, you can see that
on this little figure.

289
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:20,710
You see little blood
vessels throughout.

290
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:25,770
And after
distribution and

291
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:28,080
equilibrium. You
see the blood has

292
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:31,130
distributed to
the body at large.

293
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:38,790
And here it is in
the graph with the

294
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:42,250
distribution phase,
which is this slope here

295
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,190
of the distribution
phase is referred

296
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:47,490
to alpha, so the
distribution phase is

297
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:50,050
referred to alpha.
And the elimination

298
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:53,010
phase, this slope is
referred to beta, so

299
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:55,650
the elimination phase
is the beta phase.

300
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:58,040
That is the language
of pharmacology.

301
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:05,390
Now, that's all fine
and good, but what if

302
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:08,430
there is a change in
blood flow to the various

303
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:10,350
tissues? Well, that's
going to change the

304
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:13,790
rate of drug distribution
to the tissues.

305
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:17,650
Thus, the effect of
a drug at various

306
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:20,950
sites of action
can vary depending

307
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:23,930
on the perfusion
of these sites. So

308
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:26,050
if there's reduced
perfusion, there's

309
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:27,910
going to be less
drug delivered.

310
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:32,210
Clearance.

311
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:35,730
Very, very
important concept.

312
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:41,850
Really all drugs, all
drug pharmacokinetic

313
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:46,450
concepts are circle
around clearance.

314
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:50,530
Clearance is
a total thing.

315
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,870
We think of
clearance through the

316
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:56,250
kidneys with excretion,
certainly clearance

317
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,610
through the liver
with metabolism,

318
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:01,330
but there can be
clearance through

319
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:08,430
these other routes of
bile, sweat, saliva,

320
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:10,790
breast milk, lungs,
if it's gases.

321
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,790
It's not a lot that
goes out that way.

322
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:16,530
So we really,
when we're talking

323
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,830
about clearance,
basically we're

324
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,630
talking about
these two routes.

325
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:22,790
But we must not forget

326
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:24,870
that the drugs can go out

327
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:28,830
in the fluids through
these other routes.

328
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,150
Clearance depends,
first of all, on the

329
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:34,270
drug. What are the
properties of the drug?

330
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:37,930
That will determine
how it is cleared.

331
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:41,370
The blood flow, which
I mentioned, and

332
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:43,330
the condition of the
organs of elimination

333
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:45,690
in the patient.
How healthy are

334
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:48,590
the kidneys? How
healthy is the liver?

335
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:55,330
Clearance is the
proportionality factor

336
00:19:55,330 --> 00:20:00,190
that predicts the
rate of elimination

337
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:02,790
in relation to the
drug concentration.

338
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,770
So we have a
starting point.

339
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:08,070
The rate of drug
elimination is

340
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:11,040
directly proportional
to the concentration

341
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:15,550
when clearance
is constant.

342
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,550
Here is the
relationship here.

343
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:22,090
Clearance equals the

344
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:23,360
rate of drug elimination.

345
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:27,370
I put milligrams per
minute but it could

346
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:35,290
be liters per
hour to the drug

347
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:37,930
concentration in the
measured fluid and we're

348
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:40,770
usually thinking
about blood plasma

349
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,550
serum could be urine
but we're going to

350
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:49,110
confine ourselves
to thinking about it

351
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:51,930
in the central
compartment the blood.

352
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:55,910
And I put milligrams
per milliliter

353
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:59,650
here. It could be
different units,

354
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:04,990
but I want to point
out we have to

355
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:07,930
factor in the weight
of the patient.

356
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:14,030
Now, rearranging
this equation, drug

357
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:17,130
elimination rate equals
clearance times the

358
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:20,230
concentration in the
blood, in the plasma,

359
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:22,330
in the serum, whatever
we're measuring.

360
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:26,690
At the steady state,
which I will talk

361
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:29,990
about in more detail
in the second part,

362
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:34,930
the dosing rate equals

363
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:36,090
the rate of elimination.

364
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:41,590
Therefore, the dosing
rate equals clearance

365
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:45,130
times concentration
in the blood

366
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:50,110
at steady state. And
this is the form that

367
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:53,290
we are going to be
using after this.

368
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:55,950
Dosing rate equals
clearance times

369
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:59,110
the concentration
at steady state.

370
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:02,230
Steady state is the
dynamic equilibrium

371
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:07,510
that occurs with
continuous dosing.

372
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:14,410
And the rate in
equals the rate out.

373
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:17,560
The rate of drug
elimination equals

374
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:20,410
the rate of drug
administration.

375
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:24,110
Dynamic equilibrium
between the

376
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:27,770
blood and the
various tissues,

377
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:30,970
the blood and the
plasma proteins

378
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:32,730
in the blood, it's all in

379
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:35,470
dynamic equilibrium,
steady state.

380
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,120
We'll talk about
these three

381
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,680
parameters now,
extraction ratio,

382
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,940
bioavailability, and
the area under the

383
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:49,160
concentration
versus time curve.

384
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:53,100
Extraction ratio.

385
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,420
So what's extraction
to begin with?

386
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:59,660
Extraction is
the ability of

387
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:03,520
an organ to remove
active drug.

388
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,060
Simply that.

389
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,860
The extraction
ratio is a clearance

390
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:11,060
model of an
organ's intrinsic

391
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:16,440
capacity, its
ability to remove,

392
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:22,020
metabolize, excrete
a particular drug.

393
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,620
So intrinsic capacity
for eliminating

394
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:29,120
a particular drug
in a single pass

395
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,020
through the organ
at steady state.

396
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:37,620
And I have a
figure on the next

397
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:40,700
slide that will
illustrate this.

398
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,060
First, let's introduce

399
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,750
you to the relationship.

400
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,720
So, how do we come
up with the amount

401
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,800
of drug that is
actually passing

402
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,540
through that organ
of elimination?

403
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:03,050
Well, we measure how
much is going in and

404
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:05,920
how much comes out at
the other end, and divide

405
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,580
it by the total amount
that's going in.

406
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:13,500
Now, extraction
ratio also depends

407
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,540
on blood flow,
Q, blood flow.

408
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,760
So clearance
equals the blood

409
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:24,640
flow times this
extraction here.

410
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:27,960
And that's going to
give us clearance

411
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,500
equals blood flow
times the extraction.

412
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,080
And rearranging, this

413
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,900
is our extraction ratio.

414
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,640
So,

415
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,580
extraction equals
clearance of that

416
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,480
particular organ
divided by blood

417
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,500
flow to that
particular organ.

418
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:48,160
We are talking now about
the unbound fraction

419
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:52,320
of drug in the plasma
because it is only

420
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:56,940
the unbound fraction or
the free fraction that

421
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:01,920
is able to pass into
the liver and be

422
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:05,240
metabolized, pass into the
kidneys and be excreted

423
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:09,940
move to the target
organ the effector

424
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:13,060
organ so we're talking
about unbound fraction.

425
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:17,380
Intrinsic clearance is
the intrinsic ability

426
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:21,180
of clearance mechanisms
of the organs so

427
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:24,360
we think about with
the liver the hepatic

428
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:27,220
enzymes for example
and then the kidneys

429
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:31,400
it's various excretory
processes. So how

430
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:37,820
well does the organ
clear a particular drug?

431
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:44,020
Here's the
illustration. We'll

432
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,500
start with the oral dose.

433
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:53,200
Now the person swallows
the drug and it goes

434
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,160
through the stomach
and it goes into the

435
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:58,760
small intestine and it
may not be completely

436
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,880
absorbed and it goes
on through to the

437
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,940
gut or it might be
pumped back out by p

438
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:07,120
-glycoprotein and it
goes through the gut so

439
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,960
there's certain amount
that may not be absorbed

440
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:15,340
and whatever gets
absorbed will go into

441
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:19,200
the portal circulation
and on it goes to the

442
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,520
liver and this partal
circulation is blood

443
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:25,840
so there's a certain
blood flow that is

444
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,840
bringing the absorbed
concentration of drug

445
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:34,790
into the liver so here
we have concentration

446
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:40,260
in now within the liver
a certain amount is

447
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:43,640
going to be metabolized
there are a few

448
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,950
drugs that actually are
not very extensively

449
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:49,960
metabolized in the
liver but most drugs are

450
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:53,580
metabolized to a
certain extent so they

451
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:56,320
would be inactive that's
what we're going to

452
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:01,140
be talking about
elimination by the liver

453
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:06,320
means conversion
biotransformation of a drug

454
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,560
from its active form
to its inactive form

455
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:14,320
That's for now,
that's not, as you

456
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,000
may remember when
we talked about

457
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,840
metabolism, there are
various things that

458
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,960
can happen, but
this is what we're

459
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,840
talking about for
this illustration.

460
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,400
Now on the other side,
we have blood flow

461
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,640
after the liver and
the concentration that

462
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,200
comes out. So C in
minus C out divided

463
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,300
by C in. And this is
the fraction that gets

464
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:40,620
into the systemic
circulation. So this

465
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:47,600
is the amount of drug
that's bioavailable.

466
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,760
Now the drug will travel

467
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,600
around, passes
by the kidneys.

468
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:00,200
there will be clearance
by the kidneys,

469
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
renal excretion
of the drug or

470
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,520
a certain fraction
of the drug.

471
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:10,320
We see the extraction
ratio here for renal.

472
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,100
I'm sorry I keep pushing
the wrong button.

473
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:18,720
And whatever else
travels around. Another

474
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,060
dose is given at the
appropriate time and

475
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:23,380
on and on and on. Now,
let's say we're giving

476
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:25,680
an intravenous dose
of the same drug,

477
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:32,060
goes into the vein,
goes through the heart,

478
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:36,600
goes into the
arterial system, gets

479
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,560
distributed to the body,
including passing by the

480
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:43,310
kidney, and passing
through the liver.

481
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:49,380
So this is the one pass
through C in, C out,

482
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:53,280
C in to the kidney,
C out of the kidney.

483
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:56,390
We get a certain
amount in the systemic

484
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:59,440
circulation and on
and on. So we see

485
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,800
that the extraction
ratio applies to

486
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,240
drugs by any route
of administration.

487
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:16,140
I which will pass
through the liver,

488
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:20,400
and a certain amount
will be extracted.

489
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:27,560
It could be 90%
extracted, so only

490
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:31,880
10% gets in. That
would be not great.

491
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:36,160
It could be 50%
extracted, so 50%

492
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:40,580
gets in. It could
be 10% extracted.

493
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:44,560
So 90% comes out
the other side.

494
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:48,120
That's going to depend
on the specific drug.

495
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:52,380
Drug A, drug B, drug
C, whatever it is.

496
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:59,960
Most drugs fall kind
of in a range sort of

497
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,400
in the middle. They
get extracted, but

498
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,950
they also have reasonable
bioavailability.

499
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:11,660
the big f capital
f stands for the

500
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:17,110
bioavailability
that's fraction that
comes out after

501
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:20,040
passing through the
organ and the small

502
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:23,600
f refers to the fraction
that gets absorbed

503
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:45,600
the explanation of
of the blood flow

504
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,620
bringing drug to the
organ of elimination,

505
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:52,000
liver mainly, is
what we think about.

506
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:57,620
So the amount of
drug that gets

507
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:01,080
to the organ of
elimination is

508
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,500
going to depend
on the blood flow.

509
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,240
Now, what if
the liver is not

510
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:11,220
functional? What if
it's fibrotic? It's

511
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:13,860
got a patient who
has cirrhosis.

512
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,720
Well,

513
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:21,140
the liver is not
functioning. The blood

514
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:24,760
is going to pass
right really by the,

515
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:32,250
it's going to shunt
past the liver. And

516
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:37,420
as a result, if a drug,
let's say, normally

517
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:48,580
drug A is 90%
extracted by the liver

518
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,660
so that it's got a
10% bioavailability,

519
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:56,500
well now the liver
is not extracting.

520
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:01,280
What is the bioavailability
going to be?

521
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:05,300
It could be very, very
much larger. Let's

522
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:11,700
say 100% now of the
dose goes out into

523
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:16,380
the systemic circulation.
That's 10 times.

524
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:20,640
And that could cause
some serious toxicity.

525
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:30,540
Well, let's say drug B
has very little hepatic

526
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:35,600
extraction, and its
bioavailability normally

527
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:42,800
is 90%, and if the
liver is fibrotic and

528
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:47,320
blood passes really
right by the liver, It's

529
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:50,080
shunted past the liver,
and now let's say

530
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:54,960
it's 100%, just using
extremes as examples.

531
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:58,160
It's only slightly more

532
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,740
bioavailable for drug B.

533
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,880
We still have to think
about it, though.

534
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:09,240
And the same
concept goes for the

535
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,420
kidneys. If the blood
flow to the kidneys

536
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:14,120
is reduced, such
as with heart

537
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:18,560
failure or low kidney
function, chronic

538
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:22,820
kidney disease,
then less of a dose

539
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:26,640
will be excreted
through the kidneys.

540
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:34,330
Which brings us to
renal extraction, the

541
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:37,470
fraction of active drug
excreted in the urine.

542
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:44,330
we have blood going
into the kidney through

543
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:48,590
the afferent arteriole
passes through the

544
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:50,940
glomerulus this is a
bunch of capillaries

545
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:54,430
in here and they
capillaries filter the

546
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:58,910
plasma and here is the
artery coming out the

547
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:04,850
efferent renal artery
and from the efferent

548
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:08,490
then there are a peritubular
capillary network

549
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:12,850
that really just
surround the nephron.

550
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:18,650
Therefore, the
fraction of active drug

551
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:20,510
excreted in the
urine is dependent

552
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:23,110
on the renal blood
flow, obviously,

553
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:26,950
the protein binding,
because only free drug

554
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:29,320
is going to pass
through the glomerulus,

555
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:33,590
and how functional
are the nephrons.

556
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:39,250
The glomerular
filtration rate is

557
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:42,650
going to depend on
renal blood flow

558
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:46,650
and the health of
the glomerulus.

559
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:54,130
About 20% of free
drug, certain drugs

560
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:57,170
that are dissolved
in plasma, can pass

561
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:59,210
through the glomerulus
at any given

562
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:01,670
time because only
about 20% of the plasma

563
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:05,600
is filtered on one
pass-through. Now,

564
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:09,390
whatever drug comes
out, goes around,

565
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:13,150
and can enter the nephron

566
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:15,170
through transporters.

567
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:20,330
Whatever drug enters
the nephron and

568
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:22,810
passes through,
this representation

569
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:26,910
is not what the
nephron actually looks

570
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:28,870
like, it's just
a representation.

571
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:37,070
will pass through and
if the drug can pass

572
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,910
through physiologic
barriers has

573
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:42,970
lipophilicity it'll pass
back into the bloodstream

574
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:46,750
it'll be reabsorbed
and then whatever

575
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:49,850
is left will be
excreted in the urine.

576
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:55,110
So to review renal
clearance is affected

577
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:57,670
by renal blood flow
protein binding, function

578
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:59,870
of the nephrons, the
glomerular filtration

579
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:02,650
rate, the secretion
rate from the

580
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:07,710
peritubular fluid
into the nephron,
and reabsorption

581
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:10,650
from the nephron
back into the blood,

582
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:14,430
and that is however
much gets extracted.

583
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,790
Bioavailability,
I've mentioned this a

584
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:26,150
few times now, it is
indicated by a capital

585
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:28,690
F. It is the fraction
of active drug

586
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:31,330
that reaches this
systemic circulation.

587
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:34,470
That's also
referred to as

588
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:35,870
the central compartment.

589
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:40,870
Dose, well obviously
the dose is going to

590
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:43,370
determine the
bioavailability. It's a low

591
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:46,370
dose, smaller amount
gets into the systemic

592
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:49,510
circulation. High
dose, a larger amount.

593
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:53,010
And the fraction
of the dose that is

594
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:55,990
absorbed and escapes
first pass elimination.

595
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:00,090
So, absorbed here,
we're talking

596
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:02,290
about oral most
frequently.

597
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:06,050
Ah, sorry.

598
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:11,230
So, bioavailability
equals

599
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:12,910
the amount that
gets absorbed.

600
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:18,330
One minus extraction,
and that's going to

601
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:29,130
give us some number
between 0.0 to 0.99 to 1.

602
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:32,030
1 equals 100%. So

603
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:39,770
it's going to reduce
absorption and complete

604
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:41,730
release of the drug
from the dosage

605
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:44,330
form. If it's not
released from the tablet

606
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:48,410
or the capsule or
whatever dosage form,

607
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:52,050
it's going to just
pass through the gut.

608
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:57,870
for drugs that are
unable to cross

609
00:37:57,870 --> 00:38:02,250
physiologic barriers
or have a low ability

610
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,590
there will be more
drug that does not

611
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:10,330
get absorbed efflux
by p-glycoprotein

612
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:12,510
and other efflux
transporters it gets

613
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:16,100
dumped right back
out of the intestinal

614
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:20,190
cells epithelial cells
back into the gut

615
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:24,230
and intestinal
epithelium has the

616
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:26,730
capacity of actually
metabolizing

617
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:30,710
drug. So if it gets
metabolized in the

618
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:33,030
gut epithelial
cells, it's not going

619
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:34,730
to reach the
portal circulation.

620
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:43,970
Bioavailability
must be factored

621
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:46,190
into the oral
dosing calculations.

622
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:52,170
The example that's
frequently used

623
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:55,040
is verapamil, which is an

624
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,430
antihypertensive
drug, antiarrhythmic.

625
00:38:57,530 --> 00:39:00,050
It has both capacities.

626
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:06,410
And we're using an
extraction ratio of 0.67

627
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:09,370
two-thirds because it's
easy to talk about.

628
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:12,190
Verapamil
actually has quite

629
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:15,570
a range of
bioavailabilities.

630
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:18,690
This is why you need to

631
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:19,850
monitor your patient.

632
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:23,510
So the expected oral
bioavailability would

633
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:29,780
be 1 minus 0.7, 1 minus
the extraction, and

634
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:36,730
that results in 0.33,
F equals 0.33, which

635
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:39,630
is 33%. Okay, what
do we do with that

636
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:45,170
information? So, the
dosing rate calculation is

637
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:48,850
clearance times steady
state concentration.

638
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:51,230
But we have
to divide that

639
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:53,820
by the bioavailability.

640
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:59,030
So, with this
verapamil example,

641
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:03,630
well, IV is always
going to be 100%

642
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:07,670
no matter what. f
equals 1, which is

643
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:10,030
sometimes omitted
because it is 1.

644
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,250
We have our IV
dose. Let's say

645
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:14,890
it's 5 milligrams
per hour.

646
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:18,270
That's going to be in
a 24-hour period. The

647
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:21,270
patient will have
received 120 milligrams.

648
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,130
So we want to figure
out the oral dose

649
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:26,950
because we want to
send the patient

650
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:29,990
home on the oral
drug. Been stabilized.

651
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:32,250
I want to keep
that drug level

652
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:34,370
within the
therapeutic range.

653
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:37,970
So we figure out the
dose that the patient's

654
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:41,550
been getting, divided
by the bioavailability,

655
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:45,890
and the patient's
been getting this

656
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:48,710
over 24 hours, that's
the total amount,

657
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:51,990
divided by the
bioavailability, and that

658
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:56,990
will bring us to 360
milligrams, and we

659
00:40:56,990 --> 00:40:59,510
can give the patient
an extended release

660
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:03,090
tablet once a day, or
a capsule once a day.

661
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:12,370
Area under the
concentration time curve.

662
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:17,510
The AUC integrates
the concentration

663
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:21,610
of drug and plasma
over time, and that

664
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:26,780
will tell us the
total body exposure of

665
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:31,270
the patient, of the
body, to a dose of

666
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:34,110
drug. And this is
figured out either

667
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:36,410
for a single dose
or, more frequently,

668
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:41,410
for one dosing interval
at steady state.

669
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:50,450
Dose is given,
reaches a peak, and

670
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:53,210
is gradually
eliminated over time.

671
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:58,050
This would be a trough
level is taken here.

672
00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:01,690
and all these
dots represent

673
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:04,790
samples, blood
samples taken and

674
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:06,590
the concentration
determined.

675
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:13,710
Clearance may be
estimated from AUC.

676
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:15,970
It's not a definition of

677
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:17,730
clearance, but
it's an estimation.

678
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:21,930
Using this concept,
clearance equals dose

679
00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:24,510
divided by the steady
state concentration.

680
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:25,750
Therefore,

681
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:27,710
clearance would equal the

682
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:29,850
dose divided by the AUC.

683
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:32,830
This is the amount
of drug that

684
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:35,070
the patient has
been exposed

685
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:37,570
to in a given
amount of time.

686
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:43,490
In this case, it would
be a 12-hour period.

687
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:51,530
The bioavailability
of a drug determines

688
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:53,970
this concentration
in plasma, right?

689
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:59,290
which over time
determines the actual body

690
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:02,270
exposure of the drug.
So what relationships

691
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:05,020
are we seeing here?
We're seeing the

692
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:07,650
bioavailability of the
drug, because that's the

693
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:10,830
concentration in the
systemic circulation,

694
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:14,890
and clearance. So

695
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:24,170
how are we using
this idea of AUC?

696
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:30,750
There is a clinical
application for it.

697
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:34,370
So here are a couple
of definitions again.

698
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:37,830
Absolute bioavailability
and we can remember

699
00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:40,230
absolute because we're
comparing it to the

700
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:45,580
IV dose which is
absolutely bioavailable,

701
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:51,020
100% bioavailable. So
we'll compare Or the

702
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:56,030
drug given intravenously
by the same drug given

703
00:43:56,030 --> 00:44:00,030
by another root, such
as the oral root. Or

704
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:02,680
it could be subcutaneously,
or intramuscularly,

705
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:05,810
or transdermally,
but some other root.

706
00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:09,720
We used oral in
this example.

707
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:15,730
by dividing the area
under the concentration

708
00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:19,910
versus time curve
for the oral dose

709
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:23,530
by the IV dose, we
will come up with our

710
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:26,390
absolute bioavailability.
Okay, that's

711
00:44:26,390 --> 00:44:29,010
great. That helps us.
And when we look at

712
00:44:29,010 --> 00:44:31,030
the drug monographs
and we see the

713
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:35,830
bioavailability of a
particular dosage form,

714
00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:41,170
it's based on this
concept clinical

715
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:43,950
application we saw
that with verapamil

716
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:48,850
clinical application now
relative bioavailability

717
00:44:48,850 --> 00:44:51,050
just means comparing the

718
00:44:51,050 --> 00:44:53,830
bioavailability of different
formulations of the

719
00:44:53,830 --> 00:44:56,070
same drug for example
we want to compare

720
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:59,430
the tablet the
capsule the solution

721
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:02,390
and the drug
companies do this

722
00:45:02,390 --> 00:45:05,950
and tell us the relative
bioavailabilities

723
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:08,390
and the relative dosing.

724
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:12,110
So if I am giving
my patient a

725
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:14,070
tablet form and
I want to switch

726
00:45:14,070 --> 00:45:15,910
the patient over
to the solution,

727
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:19,410
am I going to be able
to do it dose per

728
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:22,010
dose or is it going
to have a different

729
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:24,370
dose for the solution
than for the tablet?

730
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:31,630
another very very
common application of

731
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:34,210
relative bioavailability
is comparing the

732
00:45:34,210 --> 00:45:38,790
same drug in the same
dosage forms made by

733
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:42,210
different companies
the branded drug comes

734
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:43,750
out first and
there's a lot of

735
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:47,810
pharmacokinetic information
on that and then over

736
00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:51,130
time after the patent
expires then generic

737
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:53,450
tablets can come out
generic tablets or

738
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:56,360
capsules or whatever
the dosage form and

739
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:59,450
we want to know is
the bioavailability of

740
00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:01,910
the generic exactly
the same as that of

741
00:46:01,910 --> 00:46:05,410
the branded product
because if it is and

742
00:46:05,410 --> 00:46:09,030
it demonstrates safety
and efficacy then

743
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:12,890
we can confidently
prescribe the generic,

744
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:17,950
which is cheaper,
more cost

745
00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:20,270
-effective than the
brand name drug.

746
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:24,410
So that's relative
bioavailability,

747
00:46:24,410 --> 00:46:25,450
two ways of looking at

748
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:26,720
it. Now I have
an illustration.

749
00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:33,130
In this example,
and this is from the

750
00:46:33,130 --> 00:46:35,810
Basic and Clinical
Pharmacology textbook,

751
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:41,230
We have drug A,
which is rapidly

752
00:46:41,230 --> 00:46:43,030
and completely
available. So what

753
00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:45,070
would that be?
The IV, of course.

754
00:46:45,490 --> 00:46:48,210
Drug A curve is here.

755
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:54,150
And the area under
the concentration

756
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:57,130
versus time curve
is calculated.

757
00:46:58,950 --> 00:47:01,610
Now let's look
at drug C because

758
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:04,150
that one's right
underneath.

759
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:09,750
drugs completely available
but the rate only

760
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:14,690
half of a so this
could be an oral drug

761
00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:19,710
that actually is completely
absorbed but it's

762
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:22,470
going to be entering
the body much more

763
00:47:22,470 --> 00:47:28,750
slowly and then we see
that the elimination rate

764
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:32,150
is approximately the
same the rate I mean

765
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:40,730
the ****** now B is
only half the available

766
00:47:40,850 --> 00:47:44,150
availability of a but
the rate is equal to

767
00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:49,590
a so here's the rate
and see the rate is the

768
00:47:49,590 --> 00:47:55,210
same but the bioavailability
let's say it's

769
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:57,850
a solution and the
solution is not as well

770
00:47:57,850 --> 00:48:03,950
absorbed is much lower
and the area under

771
00:48:03,950 --> 00:48:06,690
the concentration time
curve is much lower.

772
00:48:06,890 --> 00:48:11,570
So that's a way to
apply the AUC when

773
00:48:11,570 --> 00:48:15,350
comparing the same
drug to different

774
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:19,930
formulations or the
same drug in the same

775
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:22,410
formulation made by a
different manufacturer.

776
00:48:26,630 --> 00:48:28,590
Moving now to the
apparent volume

777
00:48:28,590 --> 00:48:33,130
of distribution,
the volume D.

778
00:48:36,990 --> 00:48:41,430
In this simple model
of a single homogeneous

779
00:48:41,430 --> 00:48:43,730
compartment
where the dose is

780
00:48:43,730 --> 00:48:47,210
administered and
immediately distributes to

781
00:48:47,210 --> 00:48:51,890
the entire volume
and we get clearance.

782
00:48:51,910 --> 00:48:54,910
So dose end,
distribution immediately,

783
00:48:55,370 --> 00:48:57,490
and elimination.

784
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:03,370
Volume of distribution
is the proportionality

785
00:49:03,370 --> 00:49:05,490
constant that
relates the total

786
00:49:05,490 --> 00:49:10,530
amount of drug in the
body volume to the

787
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:13,910
plasma concentration
at a given time.

788
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:19,350
Volume equals
the dose divided

789
00:49:19,350 --> 00:49:21,490
by the
concentration in the

790
00:49:21,490 --> 00:49:24,430
measured fluid,
blood or plasma.

791
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:28,770
The drug has to
get into the blood

792
00:49:28,770 --> 00:49:30,690
or plasma, the
central compartment,

793
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:32,160
in order to
be distributed

794
00:49:32,530 --> 00:49:33,830
around the body.

795
00:49:35,050 --> 00:49:38,410
This is a calculation,
so it is an

796
00:49:38,410 --> 00:49:40,830
apparent or a
theoretical volume.

797
00:49:43,010 --> 00:49:45,370
You may hear about
drugs that have a

798
00:49:45,370 --> 00:49:48,150
volume of distribution
of 5,000 liters.

799
00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:51,210
Well, clearly, bodies
are not that big,

800
00:49:51,210 --> 00:49:53,750
which is why it's
an apparent volume.

801
00:49:56,350 --> 00:50:00,130
But of course,
we are not a

802
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:03,630
single
distributive model.

803
00:50:03,790 --> 00:50:07,270
We saw this before
where drug goes

804
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:10,010
into blood and at
the same time is

805
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:11,670
starting to
distribute to these

806
00:50:11,670 --> 00:50:13,790
other tissues, but
much more slowly.

807
00:50:18,170 --> 00:50:21,670
and this concept of
volume of distribution

808
00:50:21,670 --> 00:50:23,710
is important when
we're talking

809
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:26,190
about the amount of
drug in the blood.

810
00:50:27,490 --> 00:50:32,550
In our top panel
these wiggly lines

811
00:50:32,550 --> 00:50:36,270
in the pink portion
Distribution

812
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:41,110
represents the
plasma proteins, and

813
00:50:41,110 --> 00:50:43,510
there are two units
of blood that are

814
00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:46,390
given, drug A,
according to this.

815
00:50:47,590 --> 00:50:49,230
Now volume of
distribution

816
00:50:49,230 --> 00:50:50,570
equals the amount
of drug in the

817
00:50:50,570 --> 00:50:52,370
body divided by
concentration,

818
00:50:52,370 --> 00:50:55,650
so dose divided by Cp.

819
00:50:57,050 --> 00:50:59,590
And the drug will
now distribute

820
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:01,310
out of the central
compartment, out

821
00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:02,810
of the blood,
into the tissues,

822
00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:05,170
and this will be in

823
00:51:05,170 --> 00:51:07,470
equilibrium at
steady state.

824
00:51:07,630 --> 00:51:09,990
Back and forth and
back and forth.

825
00:51:09,990 --> 00:51:14,550
So let's, this is 18
units in tissue, so

826
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:16,830
let's calculate the
volume of distribution.

827
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:24,130
Total 18 plus 2, so
20 liters divided by

828
00:51:24,130 --> 00:51:26,730
2, which is what the
amount in the blood,

829
00:51:28,050 --> 00:51:31,110
equals 10 liters.
So the volume of

830
00:51:31,110 --> 00:51:34,630
distribution in the top
example is 10 liters.

831
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:40,710
Just to remind you,
the drug is not

832
00:51:40,710 --> 00:51:43,730
bound to any plasma
proteins, not bound

833
00:51:43,730 --> 00:51:46,070
to any tissue proteins.
It's just moving

834
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:48,790
back and forth
between the blood and

835
00:51:48,790 --> 00:51:50,770
the tissue in a
dynamic equilibrium.

836
00:51:51,190 --> 00:51:53,750
So let's take the
second example now.

837
00:51:53,870 --> 00:51:59,450
Same number of
units, but now the

838
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:02,610
drug is bound to
plasma proteins.

839
00:52:02,930 --> 00:52:06,110
18 units worth
of that dose are

840
00:52:06,110 --> 00:52:08,170
bound to the
plasma proteins.

841
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:13,030
Remembering, here's
one that's not bound,

842
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:15,310
here's another one
that's not bound,

843
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:18,330
remembering that when
a drug is bound to

844
00:52:18,330 --> 00:52:20,990
plasma proteins it's
riding around on

845
00:52:20,990 --> 00:52:23,610
the albumin bus could
be other proteins

846
00:52:23,610 --> 00:52:25,890
but it's usually
albumin so when it's

847
00:52:25,890 --> 00:52:28,950
riding around on the
albumin bus it's not

848
00:52:28,950 --> 00:52:31,180
going into the liver
to be metabolized

849
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:33,830
it's not going through
the kidney to be

850
00:52:34,370 --> 00:52:37,610
excreted and it's
not moving into

851
00:52:37,610 --> 00:52:40,290
the tissues or
to the side of

852
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:42,710
action it's just
riding the bus

853
00:52:43,090 --> 00:52:46,710
So in this case, we
do measure how much

854
00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:48,610
drug is in the
vascular compartment

855
00:52:48,610 --> 00:52:50,430
because we're measuring
how much is the

856
00:52:50,430 --> 00:52:53,970
total amount on plasma
proteins and free.

857
00:52:54,530 --> 00:52:56,830
Two units have
made it into

858
00:52:56,830 --> 00:52:58,610
the tissue compartment.

859
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:02,010
So the volume of
distribution is 20

860
00:53:02,010 --> 00:53:05,830
divided by 18 liters,
which is 1.1 liters.

861
00:53:05,830 --> 00:53:10,650
So let's compare that.
10 liters when the

862
00:53:10,650 --> 00:53:13,010
drug is just freely
moving back and forth

863
00:53:13,010 --> 00:53:16,030
because it's not bound
to anything compared to

864
00:53:16,030 --> 00:53:21,510
one liter when it remains
in the blood so if

865
00:53:21,510 --> 00:53:25,270
you see a volume of
distribution that's a

866
00:53:25,270 --> 00:53:31,330
low amount then you
know that that drug is

867
00:53:31,330 --> 00:53:37,050
remaining largely in
the vascular compartment

868
00:53:39,790 --> 00:53:44,490
and now our final
example in which

869
00:53:44,490 --> 00:53:50,110
two units of blood
remains in the blood

870
00:53:50,110 --> 00:53:54,450
it is not bound to
anything this is

871
00:53:54,450 --> 00:53:57,210
an example of 200
units now have

872
00:53:57,210 --> 00:54:02,070
been given because
so much is bound to

873
00:54:02,450 --> 00:54:04,590
proteins and
macromolecules in

874
00:54:04,590 --> 00:54:06,850
the tissues. It
is sequestered

875
00:54:06,850 --> 00:54:09,530
in the tissues,
so it is not

876
00:54:10,470 --> 00:54:13,450
being metabolized. It
is not being excreted.

877
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:15,950
It is not moving to
the site of action.

878
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:24,470
So we have 200 liters
now divided by two,

879
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:27,570
which leaves a volume
of distribution of

880
00:54:27,570 --> 00:54:30,590
100 liters. So when
you see a huge volume

881
00:54:30,590 --> 00:54:34,890
of distribution, it
means that a large

882
00:54:34,890 --> 00:54:39,550
fraction of the drug
is in the tissues.

883
00:54:42,090 --> 00:54:44,690
That's basically
the whole concept.

884
00:54:44,690 --> 00:54:50,230
So you might need to
be able to calculate

885
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:52,370
the volume of
distribution. You

886
00:54:52,370 --> 00:54:54,990
should absolutely
know what it means.

887
00:54:55,490 --> 00:54:58,750
If you see a volume
of distribution

888
00:54:58,750 --> 00:55:01,630
calculation on a board
exam, for example,

889
00:55:02,190 --> 00:55:04,270
I'm sure it'll be
an easy one that

890
00:55:04,270 --> 00:55:05,830
you can actually
do in your head.

891
00:55:06,530 --> 00:55:09,530
It is the concept
you need to remember.

892
00:55:10,450 --> 00:55:12,550
Low volume of
distribution,

893
00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:13,570
blood stays in drug.

894
00:55:13,570 --> 00:55:15,730
High volume of
distribution,

895
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:17,130
drug is in tissues.

896
00:55:19,170 --> 00:55:21,610
This is the simplest
explanation.

897
00:55:25,810 --> 00:55:29,490
When plasma protein
binding is reversible,

898
00:55:29,490 --> 00:55:34,690
which it is 99
.99999% of the time,

899
00:55:35,010 --> 00:55:38,230
a chemical equilibrium
exists between

900
00:55:38,230 --> 00:55:40,630
bound and unbound
drugs. So here we have

901
00:55:40,630 --> 00:55:43,950
our dynamic equilibrium
concept again.

902
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:49,850
At the top we see a
free drug molecule

903
00:55:49,850 --> 00:55:52,170
and we see all those
molecules now bound

904
00:55:52,170 --> 00:55:56,510
to plasma protein
and it will, based on

905
00:55:56,510 --> 00:55:59,570
the affinity of the
protein for the drug,

906
00:55:59,570 --> 00:56:02,480
the drug for the protein,
it will associate,

907
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:05,370
dissociate,
associate, dissociate.

908
00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:11,750
Looking at panel B,

909
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:18,710
drug and plasma
can pass through to

910
00:56:18,710 --> 00:56:21,770
the tissues and pass
back, it's going

911
00:56:21,770 --> 00:56:24,710
to be in dynamic
equilibrium, and

912
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:29,470
as the drug becomes
unbound, and

913
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:31,570
this is a dynamic
equilibrium again,

914
00:56:32,230 --> 00:56:35,310
as it becomes unbound,
it can pass into

915
00:56:35,310 --> 00:56:38,810
the tissues, and another
drug molecule will

916
00:56:38,810 --> 00:56:41,510
bind to that plasma
protein binding site.

917
00:56:43,410 --> 00:56:48,750
The point is that the
equilibrium between

918
00:56:48,750 --> 00:56:52,070
bound and free drug
gets re-established.

919
00:56:58,270 --> 00:57:01,450
Now we talk about
drug-drug interactions

920
00:57:01,450 --> 00:57:03,670
and we think about
how important is

921
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:07,570
it if a drug is now
going to, drug B,

922
00:57:07,810 --> 00:57:10,870
is going to displace
drug A from the

923
00:57:10,870 --> 00:57:14,110
plasma protein. So
if drug B takes the

924
00:57:14,110 --> 00:57:17,450
place of drug A because
it's got a higher

925
00:57:17,450 --> 00:57:20,390
affinity for the
plasma protein, we

926
00:57:20,390 --> 00:57:23,710
now have more drug
A that is free, a

927
00:57:23,710 --> 00:57:27,390
higher concentration
of unbound drug A.

928
00:57:31,070 --> 00:57:36,430
Now, an equilibrium will
again be reestablished

929
00:57:36,430 --> 00:57:39,690
between the amount
of drug A in blood

930
00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:41,010
and the amount
that actually gets

931
00:57:41,010 --> 00:57:44,930
excreted. And this is
based on the rate of drug

932
00:57:44,930 --> 00:57:47,190
metabolism is directly
proportional to

933
00:57:47,190 --> 00:57:49,430
the free drug concentration
and the fraction

934
00:57:49,430 --> 00:57:51,790
of drug that is
removed is constant.

935
00:57:51,790 --> 00:57:55,150
We'll get into this
more in the second part

936
00:57:55,150 --> 00:57:57,570
when we talk about
first order kinetics.

937
00:57:59,270 --> 00:58:02,370
So the increase in
free fraction will

938
00:58:02,370 --> 00:58:06,430
increase the apparent
clearance of the drug,

939
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:09,910
but the steady state
would not change.

940
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:13,170
So I will put this
here because we're

941
00:58:13,170 --> 00:58:16,350
talking about plasma
protein, but we will talk

942
00:58:16,350 --> 00:58:19,630
about steady state,
first-order kinetics,

943
00:58:19,630 --> 00:58:24,430
and clearance in Part
2, as I mentioned.

944
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:29,070
What do we need to
think about for our

945
00:58:29,070 --> 00:58:32,090
individual patient?
Changes in protein binding

946
00:58:32,090 --> 00:58:34,650
due to disease states
and drug interactions

947
00:58:34,650 --> 00:58:38,090
are clinically
relevant, mainly for a

948
00:58:38,090 --> 00:58:41,430
small subset of
drugs with a narrow

949
00:58:41,430 --> 00:58:45,810
therapeutic window and
a high potential for

950
00:58:45,810 --> 00:58:48,830
toxicity. This is what
we're thinking about.

951
00:58:50,070 --> 00:58:52,870
For example,
let's see if I

952
00:58:52,870 --> 00:58:54,990
can find a place
to write here.

953
00:58:56,750 --> 00:59:01,410
if we have a drug with
a huge therapeutic

954
00:59:01,410 --> 00:59:05,850
window and the steady
state concentration is

955
00:59:05,850 --> 00:59:09,410
right in here somewhere
and the drug gets

956
00:59:09,410 --> 00:59:12,510
displaced and the steady
state concentration

957
00:59:12,510 --> 00:59:16,090
moves up here
temporarily because a new

958
00:59:16,090 --> 00:59:21,130
equilibrium will be
established then it's

959
00:59:21,130 --> 00:59:25,010
not likely to be a
problem in the average

960
00:59:25,010 --> 00:59:28,010
patient but let's say
this therapeutic window

961
00:59:28,010 --> 00:59:30,810
is really narrow and
there are certain

962
00:59:30,810 --> 00:59:33,230
drugs that have really
narrow therapeutic

963
00:59:33,230 --> 00:59:40,030
windows and significant
toxicity if drug

964
00:59:40,030 --> 00:59:43,830
concentration is in here
and now they get displaced

965
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:46,530
the drug concentration
can be up here.

966
00:59:47,270 --> 00:59:51,410
That's when we
really care about the

967
00:59:51,410 --> 00:59:54,090
displacement from
plasma proteins.

968
00:59:57,470 --> 01:00:02,670
So in summary, the
plasma concentration

969
01:00:02,670 --> 01:00:05,490
is a function of the
rate of input of the

970
01:00:05,490 --> 01:00:08,690
drug, the dose, by
absorption into the

971
01:00:08,690 --> 01:00:12,410
plasma, the rate of
distribution into other

972
01:00:12,410 --> 01:00:15,170
tissues, and the
rate of elimination.

973
01:00:15,390 --> 01:00:18,610
So, dose absorption,

974
01:00:18,610 --> 01:00:21,290
distribution,
and elimination.

975
01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:25,330
If the rate of input
is known, the remaining

976
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:28,150
processes are well
described by the apparent

977
01:00:28,150 --> 01:00:30,230
volume of distribution
and the clearance.

978
01:00:30,490 --> 01:00:33,470
These parameters are
unique for a particular

979
01:00:33,470 --> 01:00:35,550
drug. So, we're
talking about

980
01:00:35,550 --> 01:00:38,470
particular drugs. drug
A is going to have

981
01:00:38,470 --> 01:00:40,310
different apparent
volume of distribution

982
01:00:40,310 --> 01:00:44,050
and clearance than
drug B or C or D or E.

983
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:47,450
And a particular patient,

984
01:00:47,730 --> 01:00:50,150
so different
patients are going to

985
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:51,990
also have different
apparent volumes

986
01:00:51,990 --> 01:00:54,190
of distribution
and clearance.

987
01:00:56,690 --> 01:00:59,830
So these parameters
have average values

988
01:00:59,830 --> 01:01:02,250
in the large
population that can be

989
01:01:02,250 --> 01:01:05,350
used to predict
drug concentrations.

990
01:01:05,650 --> 01:01:07,030
That's what
you're looking up

991
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:08,970
in your drug
monograph. It's a

992
01:01:08,970 --> 01:01:10,950
great starting
place for you.

993
01:01:10,950 --> 01:01:13,210
You don't have to guess.

994
01:01:18,690 --> 01:01:23,130
Clearance of a drug
is the factor that

995
01:01:23,730 --> 01:01:26,370
predicts the rate
of elimination in

996
01:01:26,370 --> 01:01:28,350
relation to the
drug concentration.

997
01:01:29,370 --> 01:01:32,270
Volume of
distribution is the

998
01:01:32,270 --> 01:01:35,510
proportionality constant
that relates the total

999
01:01:35,510 --> 01:01:37,850
amount of drug in
the body to the

1000
01:01:37,850 --> 01:01:41,410
plasma concentration
at a given moment.

1001
01:01:44,910 --> 01:01:46,570
Change in blood
flow to various

1002
01:01:46,570 --> 01:01:49,710
tissues changes
the rate of drug

1003
01:01:49,710 --> 01:01:51,310
distribution
to the tissues.

1004
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:54,050
Thus, the effect of
a drug at various

1005
01:01:54,050 --> 01:01:56,550
sites of action
can vary depending

1006
01:01:56,550 --> 01:01:58,850
on the perfusion
of these sites.

1007
01:01:59,950 --> 01:02:02,390
Removal of a drug
by an organ can be

1008
01:02:02,390 --> 01:02:05,490
specified as the
extraction ratio,

1009
01:02:06,570 --> 01:02:09,930
the capacity of
that organ to remove

1010
01:02:09,930 --> 01:02:13,010
the drug, the fraction
or percentage of

1011
01:02:13,010 --> 01:02:15,790
drug removed by the
perfusing blood, or

1012
01:02:15,790 --> 01:02:17,770
sorry, removed from
the perfusing blood

1013
01:02:17,770 --> 01:02:20,470
during one passage
through the organ.

1014
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:24,330
The bioavailability
of a drug is the

1015
01:02:24,330 --> 01:02:26,550
fraction of the
administered dose that

1016
01:02:26,550 --> 01:02:29,470
actually reaches the
systemic circulation.

1017
01:02:33,010 --> 01:02:35,850
The area under the
concentration versus time

1018
01:02:35,850 --> 01:02:37,990
curve describes the
measured concentration

1019
01:02:37,990 --> 01:02:40,850
of drug in the systemic
circulation as a

1020
01:02:40,850 --> 01:02:45,310
function of time from
zero to infinity as an

1021
01:02:45,310 --> 01:02:47,990
integration of the
concentration over time.

1022
01:02:48,290 --> 01:02:50,470
The concentration
of drug appearing

1023
01:02:50,470 --> 01:02:52,810
in plasma occurs
over time,

1024
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:54,810
and it can be
used to calculate

1025
01:02:56,090 --> 01:03:00,850
bioavailability
clinical application so

1026
01:03:00,970 --> 01:03:05,350
here are some terms
I invite you to pause

1027
01:03:05,350 --> 01:03:07,730
the computer look at
the terms see if you

1028
01:03:07,730 --> 01:03:10,630
can come up with which
one goes where and

1029
01:03:13,670 --> 01:03:16,310
here are the answers
drug products that

1030
01:03:16,310 --> 01:03:19,050
contain the same acts
of ingredients and

1031
01:03:19,050 --> 01:03:21,910
are identical in
strength or concentration

1032
01:03:21,910 --> 01:03:25,530
dosage form and route
of administration.

1033
01:03:25,630 --> 01:03:28,110
So what are we looking
at? Same active

1034
01:03:28,110 --> 01:03:31,630
ingredients, same
strength, same dosage

1035
01:03:31,630 --> 01:03:33,890
form, same route
of administration.

1036
01:03:34,690 --> 01:03:38,320
Two drugs that fit
that description.

1037
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:41,670
And that is called

1038
01:03:41,670 --> 01:03:43,390
pharmaceutical
equivalent.

1039
01:03:43,390 --> 01:03:45,370
Those are the
pharmaceutical

1040
01:03:45,370 --> 01:03:46,950
forms of those drugs.

1041
01:03:48,650 --> 01:03:50,790
Bioequivalent drug
products having

1042
01:03:50,790 --> 01:03:52,990
similar safety
and efficacy.

1043
01:03:56,810 --> 01:03:59,930
Safety and efficacy
is the key term

1044
01:03:59,930 --> 01:04:04,090
here for therapeutic
equivalence.

1045
01:04:09,490 --> 01:04:14,010
Biosimilar
products, it's a

1046
01:04:14,010 --> 01:04:15,470
biosimilar
product and meets

1047
01:04:15,470 --> 01:04:17,730
standards for
interchangeability.

1048
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:20,600
And this is called
a biosimilar.

1049
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:23,630
Please know these
terms. They are

1050
01:04:23,630 --> 01:04:27,030
described in the
notes handout, too.

1051
01:04:28,090 --> 01:04:31,370
Biological product,
highly similar to an FDA

1052
01:04:31,370 --> 01:04:35,390
-approved biological
product, and having

1053
01:04:35,390 --> 01:04:38,230
no clinically meaningful
differences in safety

1054
01:04:38,230 --> 01:04:41,730
and efficacy from the
reference product.

1055
01:04:44,010 --> 01:04:45,250
Oh,

1056
01:04:46,170 --> 01:04:47,210
biosimilar.

1057
01:04:52,830 --> 01:04:55,850
The difference
here is the

1058
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:57,990
interchangeability.
In other words,

1059
01:04:58,870 --> 01:05:04,410
if I am giving
biologic product by

1060
01:05:04,410 --> 01:05:07,070
the name of
Rituximab, by the name

1061
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:08,930
of Rituxin, which
is the brand,

1062
01:05:09,190 --> 01:05:14,070
and I want to give
another protein product

1063
01:05:14,070 --> 01:05:18,510
of Rituximab, which is
what Rituxin is, made

1064
01:05:18,510 --> 01:05:21,180
by a different company,
I want to make sure

1065
01:05:21,180 --> 01:05:24,590
that they're going to
have the same effect.

1066
01:05:25,430 --> 01:05:27,850
So they are
interchangeable.

1067
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:38,280
And this is the FDA
definition. And I want

1068
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:41,580
to tell you right
now, the FDA is

1069
01:05:41,580 --> 01:05:45,760
evaluating its definitions
on these biologic

1070
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:48,380
products, these protein
products. So what

1071
01:05:48,380 --> 01:05:50,040
you're seeing here
may be different by

1072
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:52,000
the time you actually
get into practice.

1073
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:55,400
So, pharmaceutically
equivalent drug

1074
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:57,720
products show no
significant difference

1075
01:05:57,720 --> 01:05:59,840
in the rate and
extent of absorption

1076
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:02,000
of the active
pharmaceutical agent.

1077
01:06:02,420 --> 01:06:03,830
So, they're called
bioequivalent.

1078
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:06,920
This is different
from the

1079
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:09,180
therapeutic equivalent
because of the

1080
01:06:09,180 --> 01:06:11,280
safety and
efficacy component.

1081
01:06:11,980 --> 01:06:16,980
But two drugs that
are the same drug

1082
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:20,180
in the same form,
and they have the

1083
01:06:20,180 --> 01:06:23,260
same rate and extent
of absorption,

1084
01:06:23,660 --> 01:06:27,140
are called bioequivalent.

1085
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:33,180
And that concludes
part one of

1086
01:06:33,180 --> 01:06:35,130
our clinical
pharmacokinetics.
