1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:02,820
Welcome students
to Pharmacology.

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:04,820
This is Dr.
Goldstein speaking.

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:08,380
We will begin with
Pharmacodynamics.

4
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,700
This is a two
-part lecture.

5
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:14,940
This first part is
about the introduction

6
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,340
to the drug receptor
interactions

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,320
and the dose-response
relationship.

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,810
I am available to
speak to individuals,

9
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:32,400
to your study groups,
to any groups that

10
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:36,560
you would like to zoom
on with me or come

11
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:40,440
to my office for a
pharmacology chat.

12
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:49,380
This is pharmacology.
These are the two

13
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:54,800
basic concepts of
pharmacology of all drugs.

14
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:59,340
Pharmacodynamics
is boiled down to

15
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,780
what the drug does
to the body and how.

16
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,420
And pharmacokinetics
is what the

17
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:10,980
body does to the
drug and how.

18
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:13,300
So pharmacodynamics,
we're

19
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,480
talking about
mechanisms of action,

20
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,480
dose response
relationships,

21
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,200
and in pharmacokinetics
we're talking about

22
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,160
how the drugs are
absorbed, administered,

23
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:28,700
how they distribute
throughout

24
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,960
the body, how they are

25
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,940
metabolized, how
they are excreted.

26
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,780
Metabolism and
excretion is sometimes

27
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,400
lumped into one
word elimination.

28
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:44,840
This lecture is about
the pharmacodynamics.

29
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,980
Learning Objectives.

30
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,640
This is the answer to the

31
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,620
question, what do
I need to know?

32
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:00,760
I suggest that you
focus your studies. Be

33
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,420
careful of going down
rabbit holes. levels.

34
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:07,080
You are being hit
with lots and lots

35
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,520
and lots of material
to take in, so the

36
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,000
idea is to become
efficient as possible

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,480
with your studying,
to actually learn

38
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,200
the concepts so
they stick with you.

39
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,840
And they'll be with you

40
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,060
when you take the exam.

41
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:28,480
And they will very
likely stay with

42
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,100
you after you take
the exam so that

43
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,960
you can apply them
them as you continue

44
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,100
on through your
medical education.

45
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,180
I don't normally go
over the learning

46
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,580
objectives, but
I do want to take

47
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,530
time to do it now so
you get an idea of

48
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:49,760
the concept of
learning objectives.

49
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,980
So the first one that
I have here is to apply

50
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:58,900
the physiology of
receptors, effectors, in

51
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:03,560
In other words, the
molecules that interact

52
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,420
with the receptors to
produce a response or

53
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:10,000
no response, and the
signaling mechanisms.

54
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,480
You need to be
able to define all

55
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,280
terms, it's the
language of medicine,

56
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,830
the language of
pharmacology.

57
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,760
So define all terms
that are listed in

58
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,820
the notes handout
and give examples of

59
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,780
the specific actions
for therapeutic

60
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,140
effects. Now, I want
to point out that

61
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,770
I have a companion
notes handout

62
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,850
for each and
every lecture.

63
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:45,710
This is an
optional resource.

64
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:49,710
I highly suggest
searching the

65
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:52,070
handout in order
for you to be able

66
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,910
to answer your
practice questions.

67
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:55,850
So all of the
terms that are

68
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:58,270
listed in the
handout are also

69
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:02,070
listed in the
PowerPoint. point.

70
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:09,210
Now you need
to be able to

71
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:10,810
understand the
relationships.

72
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,920
Relate how the
physicochemical

73
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,890
characteristics, which
you'll see are related

74
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,610
to the structural
features of the

75
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:21,510
drug, the structure,
it's a chemical,

76
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,950
it's some kind
of a molecule.

77
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:28,030
How these physicochemical
characteristics

78
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:31,650
determine the drug's
ability to initiate

79
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:35,670
a cellular effect, the
effector mechanism.

80
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:39,630
You should be able
to correlate the

81
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:42,850
concentration of the
drug, which is going

82
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:46,040
to be determined by
the dose, receptor

83
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:50,750
occupancy, and the
magnitude, the size,

84
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:54,030
of the pharmacologic
response by by

85
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:57,350
comparing dose-dependent
therapeutic and

86
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:00,830
toxicologic properties,
responses I mean.

87
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:04,950
Describe the
concepts of intrinsic

88
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:08,210
activity, affinity,
potency, and

89
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:11,370
efficacy by comparing
the graded dose

90
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:14,050
-response curves of
two or more drugs.

91
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:19,150
And all of these
will come clear as

92
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:21,570
we go through the
lectures. These

93
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,810
are preparation
materials. The links

94
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:32,090
are in the CPG,
but they're also on

95
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:34,110
the next slide.
Everything that's in

96
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:38,110
the CPG, the class
preparation guide,

97
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:42,650
is also on these
introductory slides.

98
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:48,810
ScholarRx bricks
are required by the

99
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:51,330
school, and my
practice questions,

100
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:53,870
which are not
graded, are required

101
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:57,650
by me. Everything
else is optional.

102
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:02,050
If you like to watch
videos to learn

103
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:04,990
things by, by all
means watch this video.

104
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:11,030
If you like to read,
I suggest textbooks

105
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:13,310
which I'll show you
links on the next page.

106
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:16,190
You can read my notes
handout. There is

107
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:19,270
no reason to memorize
the notes handout.

108
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:22,810
And I have supplied
some guided reading

109
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:25,710
questions questions
to help you focus on

110
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:28,750
what's important.
You may use these or

111
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:33,110
not. It depends on
how you like to study.

112
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,910
If you do choose
to read the guided

113
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:38,130
reading questions, or
even as you're going

114
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:41,590
along watching the
PowerPoint or looking

115
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:43,870
at the printout
of the PowerPoint,

116
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:49,330
frame questions in
your own mind or

117
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:52,270
follow the guided
reading questions and

118
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:57,070
answer them in your
own words first. This

119
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:59,160
will help you know
if you understand.

120
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:01,850
And if you can't
answer them in your

121
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:04,710
own words, then
look at the answers,

122
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:08,850
think about it, apply
it to what you already

123
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:12,070
know, and try
answering that again in

124
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:15,630
your own words. These
are some little learning

125
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:20,890
techniques that will
help you to remember,

126
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:24,010
not just memorize,
but to understand.

127
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,670
These are the links I
mentioned, ScholarRx

128
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:31,910
bricks that are
related to the

129
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:35,210
pharmacodynamics lectures,
and some optional

130
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:39,070
resources if you
like. I've put a

131
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:41,470
textbook down here.
This is the first one,

132
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:44,160
Katzengevanderol's
Basic and Clinical

133
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,210
Pharmacology. It's
quite easy to read.

134
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:53,150
Then I have included
a Lippincott

135
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,970
Illustrated Reviews.
This is a review book.

136
00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:00,090
It's a pharmacology
review book and it

137
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:05,850
is very easy to follow.
It is not loaded

138
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:08,290
with a lot of
information, just really

139
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,890
the information that
you need to know.

140
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,480
I'm going to spend a
little time talking

141
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,800
about learning
techniques. I will not be

142
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,820
doing this in later
lectures as you move

143
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,160
on. Hopefully you
will understand about

144
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,780
them and be using
them by that time. So

145
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,920
guided reading questions
I already mentioned.

146
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,560
The practice
questions are for your

147
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,720
own assessment of
your learning. If you

148
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,960
can answer my practice
questions, which are

149
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,100
sometimes simple
and sometimes not so

150
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:48,080
simple, then you can
really know that you

151
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,660
understand the concepts
of pharmacology.

152
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,280
With regard to the
practice questions,

153
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,760
I recommend that
you do a search of

154
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,760
the notes handout.
All the answers are

155
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,200
in the notes handout.
Just search it.

156
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,360
Practicing through case
vignettes will help

157
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,040
you bridge pharmacology
science and

158
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:15,420
pharmacotherapeutics,
the clinical concepts.

159
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,440
Why are you here?

160
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:22,160
You want to be able to
understand drugs, to

161
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,660
be able to prescribe
them intelligently and

162
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:31,480
competently and
confidently. But you need

163
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,070
to be able to understand
the basic concepts.

164
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,320
Write down your own
questions as you

165
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,080
study, as you're
watching the video,

166
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,520
as you're looking
at the PowerPoint

167
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,960
printout, and
you see something

168
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,020
that you wonder
about, write it down.

169
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,280
And that way you're
already thinking

170
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,560
about it, and when
the answer comes

171
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,020
up, you'll be ready
to receive it.

172
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:00,590
And some more tips.
identify and define

173
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:04,770
key ideas and
concepts, rephrase main

174
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:08,470
ideas in your own words,
convert main points

175
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,870
to questions. When
you write a question,

176
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:12,510
you really have
to think about it,

177
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:14,830
and thinking about it
helps you remember.

178
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:18,190
Relate the ideas to
what you already know.

179
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,190
Space your practice,

180
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:24,390
mix up multiple subjects,
you can't do this

181
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,210
really until you're a
lot more comfortable

182
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:30,650
with the information.
And of course, use memory

183
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:33,110
devices, mnemonics
to help you remember.

184
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:39,590
This is an example
of a concept map or

185
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:42,750
mind map, some people
call it. You can see

186
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:46,430
how all of the different
features, at least

187
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,110
in this lecture that
we're going to be

188
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:50,490
talking about, are
related to each other.

189
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:53,510
You can use concept
maps if you're

190
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:55,610
comfortable with
them, just you can

191
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:57,750
draw them out with
your own hand.

192
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:01,250
There are also
computer models for

193
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:04,430
making concept
maps. Concept maps

194
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,390
can sometimes be
time consuming,

195
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:10,310
but some students
find them very

196
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:14,170
helpful. Now I start
the lectures with

197
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,750
information that you
really need to know,

198
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,250
key concepts that
you need to know.

199
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:24,210
So, these are the
focus points for you.

200
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:28,110
I don't go over them.
This is for you.

201
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,560
If you wish to
use them, I highly

202
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,430
recommend that you
use it. It gives you

203
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:34,630
a good overview of
what the lecture

204
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:39,110
is about and it puts
it into context.

205
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,270
I did mention that
you need to be

206
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:45,950
able to understand
terms, define the

207
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,990
terms. This is
the language of

208
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:50,390
pharmacology, the
language of medicine.

209
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:52,130
So I've listed terms that

210
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:53,990
you should be
able to know.

211
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:57,610
And when you can,
this is true, this is

212
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:02,130
memorization, but when
you have them under

213
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:07,790
your belt, as it
were, you will be able

214
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:11,630
to quickly understand
what I am talking

215
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,810
about, what others are
talking about, what

216
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:20,030
your tendings are
talking about, and this

217
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:22,590
is more of what you
need to know. I will

218
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:24,950
not be reading these
slides to you. You

219
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:27,390
can read them perfectly
well on your own.

220
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:32,110
So let us begin.

221
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:35,790
The physicochemical
characteristics of

222
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:38,450
a drug determine
its ability to move

223
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:41,130
through the body and
initiate a cellular

224
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:45,230
effect. That is the
whole point of a drug.

225
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:48,110
That's how
pharmaceutical companies,

226
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:51,410
drug development
companies develop drugs.

227
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:55,810
There are pharmacokinetic
properties and

228
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:57,990
pharmacodynamic
properties and these

229
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:00,570
are related to the
structural features.

230
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:01,950
So what are we
talking about with the

231
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:04,270
structural features?
factors, the size of

232
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:06,400
the molecule, the
shape of the molecule.

233
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:10,330
Does it have
chirality? Does it not?

234
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:13,130
What is the
electrical charge? Is

235
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:15,570
it lipid soluble?
All of these features

236
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:17,770
will determine
whether or not it

237
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:20,190
actually gets to
the site of action.

238
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:23,410
And once it's
there, will it fit

239
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:27,870
its particular
target, its receptor?

240
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:32,050
So let's look at
the pharmacokinetic

241
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:35,590
properties first. The
structural features determine

242
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:38,830
the drug's ability
to be absorbed. Will

243
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:42,090
it be absorbed from
the GI tract? If not,

244
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:43,840
then it's going to
have to be injected.

245
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,990
Will it distribute
to the site of

246
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:49,110
action? In other
words, will it pass

247
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:51,630
through the
physiologic membranes,

248
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,130
the lipid bilayers
of the gut?

249
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:57,510
What will happen to it

250
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:58,950
when it's in the liver?

251
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:01,810
Will it get out
into the systemic

252
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:04,970
circulation and
once there, will it

253
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:08,710
actually get to its
target? If the target

254
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:11,710
is in the brain and
the drug does not

255
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:16,130
cross the blood
-brain barrier, then

256
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:18,010
it's not going to
get to its target.

257
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,550
What will be the
extent of its

258
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,730
metabolism as it
passes through

259
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,670
the liver and
other organs?

260
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:28,970
How will it be
excreted? Will it be

261
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:32,390
excreted as metabolites
that are inactive?

262
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:35,050
Will it be excreted
as active drug?

263
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:37,210
All of these are
related to the

264
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,870
structural features
of the molecule.

265
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,540
Now let's take
a look at the

266
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,600
pharmacodynamic
properties. You see I

267
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,680
have written
here on the side,

268
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:59,100
structure, activity,
relationship.

269
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,940
That's the whole point.

270
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,660
It needs to have
a structure that's

271
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,260
going to be able to
fit into its target.

272
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,940
So with

273
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:11,940
some, in fact many, of
the drugs we'll talk

274
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:15,900
about, I will ask
you to understand how

275
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:19,340
the structure is
related to its activity.

276
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,740
I don't ask you
to be able to draw

277
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:25,600
structures, just understand
the relationship.

278
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,980
So the structural
features will

279
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,440
determine the
receptor specificity.

280
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:36,380
Will this drug bind to
one type of receptor

281
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:40,400
or is it not very
specific and it will bind

282
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:44,120
to a variety of different
types of receptors,

283
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,820
which is really not
ideal for a drug.

284
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,960
What is the affinity
for the receptor?

285
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,220
Does it bind
tightly? Does it

286
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,360
bind weakly, somewhere
in the middle?

287
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:59,360
Does the drug
molecule activate

288
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:06,090
the effect that a normal
endogenous natural

289
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:10,180
drug ligand, I mean
not drug, endogenous

290
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:13,500
ligand would produce?
An endogenous

291
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:17,040
ligand binds to its
receptor and produces some

292
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,600
activity, whatever
that is specific for

293
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,040
the receptor type and
for the cell type,

294
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,860
well will the drug be
able to produce the

295
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:30,420
same response or some
portion of a response?

296
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:33,420
That's called
intrinsic activity.

297
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,980
Here's an example of
structure activity

298
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:42,100
relationship. You
see on the right hand

299
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,040
side on the upper
structure a very simple

300
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,690
molecule and that is
called epinephrine.

301
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,920
Epinephrine has
another name. It's

302
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,760
called adrenaline
and that is

303
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,880
a natural hormone
in our bodies.

304
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,980
Looking at the
structure below, you see

305
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:02,700
they look very, very
similar. The only

306
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:06,580
difference is that
phenylephrine is missing

307
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:09,840
this hydroxyl group
and that gives it

308
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:13,180
very similar
properties, but slightly

309
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:15,900
different properties.
And that's an example

310
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,280
of the structure
-activity relationship.

311
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,160
Now we most often look
at these structures

312
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,800
flat like this,
two-dimensionally,

313
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,940
but they have a
three-dimensional

314
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:29,340
shape in space. And it is

315
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,180
that three
-dimensional shape

316
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,680
that determines its

317
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,440
biologic
activity. acidity.

318
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:41,040
We talk about
molecular mechanisms of

319
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,960
drug action. I
mentioned before that an

320
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,560
endogenous or natural
ligand binds to

321
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:51,380
its receptor and
produces some response.

322
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:56,140
That's a molecular
mechanism. Does the drug

323
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,880
do the same thing?
That's the molecular

324
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,720
mechanism of the drug.
whatever the drug causes

325
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,820
that's its molecular
mechanism. So the

326
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:08,860
interaction of a drug with
its target brings about

327
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:14,120
a change in biologic
function because the

328
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:18,120
drug is binding to
its target and causing

329
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,960
something to happen as
a result of the binding

330
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,020
and that produces the
pharmacologic effect.

331
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,390
Now there are a couple
of pharmacologic

332
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,700
effects that we're going
to be talking about.

333
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,820
in this lecture.

334
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,280
So it can activate
the biochemical and

335
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,880
physiologic changes
that are characteristic

336
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,640
of the receptor.
It's all about the

337
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,300
receptor. The drug is
causing the receptor to

338
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:48,460
do whatever the
receptor normally does.

339
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:55,860
Or a drug can block
the receptor so that

340
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:59,420
the natural ligand
is not able to access

341
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:04,820
and therefore there
will be no response.

342
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,640
So it's a blocker,
an inhibitor.

343
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,920
So it can activate or
inhibit, bottom line.

344
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,880
Now talking about
the duration of

345
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,640
action from a
pharmacodynamic perspective,

346
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,260
we're also going
to be talking

347
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,280
about it from a
pharmacokinetic

348
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,840
perspective when we
get to that point.

349
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,420
From a pharmacodynamic
perspective,

350
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:33,740
the drug's action
may persist,

351
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,280
the duration of action,

352
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,340
until the drug
dissociates, moves away

353
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,900
from the receptor,
and that will

354
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:45,040
automatically stop the
effect. And this happens

355
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:54,920
when drug is
discontinued. It will

356
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,260
leave the receptor,
there are no other

357
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:00,420
drug molecules around
to activate the

358
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:04,140
receptor and the
effect is terminated.

359
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,600
The drug can activate
second messengers and

360
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,640
signal transduction.
So the drug may have

361
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,360
residence on the receptor
for only a very brief

362
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,260
period of time, but
it has activated

363
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:23,940
intracellular responses
and therefore the duration

364
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:27,280
of action will be
much longer than one

365
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,120
would expect considering
the brief residence

366
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,100
on the receptor. receptor.
The drug receptor

367
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:38,820
complex is destroyed
and new receptors or

368
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,820
enzymes have been
synthesized. So here I want

369
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:47,320
to say that when we
talk pharmacology ease,

370
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:52,040
receptors is a big
word. It can be enzymes,

371
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:56,000
it can be receptors
on the cell surface,

372
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,380
it can be receptors
inside, it can

373
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,780
be nucleic acid, it's
whatever the drug

374
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:06,930
target is. So sometimes
the terminology

375
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,420
kind of gets
confused. But please

376
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:12,520
understand that
receptors might mean any

377
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:16,300
of those things. It
is the drug target.

378
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:21,360
Now going back to
this point here,

379
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,200
let's say a drug
binds with very, very,

380
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,400
very high affinity
to the receptor.

381
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,740
It just does not
dissociate. And

382
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:35,560
the cell recognizes
that its receptor

383
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:38,580
that has the drug
bound is useless.

384
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:43,240
So it will internalize
the receptor.

385
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:46,100
Let's say this
is the receptor.

386
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,340
This is a very
poor picture.

387
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,740
Here's the drug on here.

388
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,780
And it will get
internalized and it will

389
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:00,990
go into the lysosome
and be degraded.

390
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:06,000
And thus, new enzyme
or new receptors have

391
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,040
to be synthesized by
that cell. And that can

392
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,600
take some time. So
the duration of action

393
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,560
is extended because
we are waiting

394
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:22,840
for the cell to replace
that drug receptor

395
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,800
complex that has
been destroyed.

396
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:30,380
Receptor effector
systems incorporate

397
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:33,420
desensitization
mechanisms for preventing

398
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:37,120
excessive activation
when agonist molecules

399
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,620
continue to be present
for long periods.

400
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:42,500
I want to say right
here, I'm not going

401
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,260
to explain it now,
we will get to that.

402
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,340
So let's take a look
at some quantitative

403
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:54,800
aspects, dose
response curves.

404
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,660
When you hear
pharmacodynamics

405
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:58,940
you're going
to be thinking

406
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:01,420
about the
quantitative aspects

407
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,380
as well as
mechanism of action.

408
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,920
What we have here is
a receptor occupancy

409
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:13,220
theory that assumes
that the portion of

410
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:16,060
occupied receptors is
related to the effect.

411
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,280
How many receptors
are occupied, that's

412
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,180
going to be related
to the size of the

413
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:24,180
effect. And this is
based in the law of

414
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:28,240
mass action. So what
we have here is the

415
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,380
relationship between
the drug concentration

416
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,440
and the pharmacologic
response.

417
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:38,180
So drug receptor,
drug receptor complex,

418
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,640
response.

419
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:47,360
This k plus 1, with
the arrow pointing in

420
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,250
this direction, this
is the association

421
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:55,160
constant. This is the
rate of association

422
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:59,000
of the drug and the
receptor to form the

423
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,200
complex. complex. This
one with the minus

424
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:06,780
one is the rate of
dissociation. The

425
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:10,200
rate at which the
drug receptor complex

426
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:14,940
dissociates into the
drug and the receptor.

427
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,880
So,

428
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:20,580
the number of
receptors that's the

429
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:23,240
concentration of
receptors occupied by the

430
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:27,600
drug depends on how
many drug molecules

431
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,140
are there. The
concentration of drug.

432
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:34,200
The drug receptor
association rate.

433
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:41,740
And the drug receptor
dissociation rate.

434
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:46,080
So drug association,

435
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:50,620
drug receptor
complex, effect.

436
00:24:57,570 --> 00:25:01,950
Equilibrium. So,
when the association,

437
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:05,150
the rate of association
equals the rate of

438
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:08,710
dissociation, we
have the equilibrium

439
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:13,770
dissociation constant,
KD, and we're going to be

440
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:18,010
talking about this
for the next several

441
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:24,830
slides. the equilibrium
dissociation constant.

442
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:27,970
That represents the
drug concentration

443
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:33,490
required to saturate 50
% of the receptors. Why?

444
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:38,050
Because we have
dissociation, rate of

445
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:41,110
association, rate of
dissociation at equilibrium.

446
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:45,390
So there are some
complex drug receptor

447
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:50,310
complexes and drug and
receptor uncomplexed.

448
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:54,190
KAD represents the
drug concentration

449
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:57,610
required to
saturate 50% of the

450
00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:00,190
receptors. Now the
affinity constant

451
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:03,070
is the inverse,
it's a reciprocal.

452
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:09,350
The greater the
affinity the smaller

453
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:13,310
the equilibrium
dissociation constant.

454
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:16,170
Alternatively,

455
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:19,610
the lower the
affinity the greater

456
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:24,710
the equilibrium
dissociation constant.

457
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:28,150
Let's see if
we can clarify

458
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:30,770
this as we go along.

459
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:33,890
Here we have graded
dose response

460
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:36,950
curves. So on the x axis,

461
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:40,650
we have the
concentration of drug A.

462
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:47,850
And here we have
something called

463
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:52,210
the EC50, the
concentration of drug

464
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:54,730
that produces is
50% of maximal

465
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:57,670
response. So E
stands for effect.

466
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:00,490
C obviously
concentration.

467
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,830
Now here we have, it's
really hard to see

468
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:12,530
it here. So by plotting
the log concentration

469
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:16,390
of the drug, we get
a sigmoid curve.

470
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:19,860
And now we can see
the concentration at

471
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:24,970
which 50% of the
concentration of drug

472
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:27,950
that produces 50% of
the maximal response.

473
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:30,490
Maximal response
on the y axis,

474
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:33,770
concentration of
drug on the x axis.

475
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,610
Okay, now we're going
to be using this

476
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:41,250
concept together
with equilibrium

477
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:46,230
dissociation constant
and receptor occupancy.

478
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,890
And here it is.

479
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:51,690
The concentration
effect and

480
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:53,370
the receptor
binding curves.

481
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:56,010
On the left hand
side we see the drug

482
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:58,530
concentration effect
relationship. So here's

483
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:01,270
the concentration of
drug again, here's the

484
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:03,610
effect of drug. We saw
that on the previous

485
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:07,930
slide. side, and
this is obviously not

486
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:10,190
log concentration,
but it's stretched out

487
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:13,370
for us so we can see
it, and here's our

488
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:17,830
concentration at which
50% response occurs.

489
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,570
On the right hand
side, oh, let me just

490
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:24,850
point out this is
maximal effect here.

491
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:27,490
This is 50% of effect,

492
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:28,930
this is maximal effect.

493
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:33,430
Here we have drug
concentration again.

494
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:36,230
Now we have the
concentration of

495
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:39,110
receptors that are
bound by the drug.

496
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:44,210
The equilibrium
dissociation constant, the

497
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:47,490
concentration at which
50% of the receptors

498
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:51,190
are bound. And here
we have the maximal

499
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:54,350
number of receptors
in the receptor pool.

500
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:58,770
It's easy to see by
looking at these two

501
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:03,320
curves that they appear
to be superimposable,

502
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:06,190
illustrating
the relationship

503
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:09,410
between the dose
-response and the

504
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:12,830
dose-receptor
occupancy curves.

505
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:19,030
In this model, the
maximal effect occurs

506
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:24,550
when the maximal number
of receptors in the

507
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:28,170
receptor pool are
occupied by the drug.

508
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:33,010
This is not always
the case, but

509
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:35,410
we're starting
with a simple idea

510
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:38,290
and we will build
on it as we go.

511
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:45,330
The graded dose-receptor
relationship and

512
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:49,130
the graded dose-response
relationship assume

513
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:54,930
that the magnitude
of the response,

514
00:29:54,930 --> 00:30:00,210
how large is the
response of the

515
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:03,310
drug, is proportional
to the concentration

516
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:06,050
of drug at the
effector site.

517
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:10,910
Now what determines
the concentration

518
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:13,710
of drug at the effector
site? The dose.

519
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:17,350
The dose determines
the concentration of

520
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:19,670
drug in the biologic
fluid and what we're

521
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:24,620
talking about almost
always is plasma, blood,

522
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:28,550
serum, you're going to
see all these terms.

523
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:33,490
Pharmacokinetic concepts.

524
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:36,890
And this will determine,
concentration in

525
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:39,390
the blood, will determine
the concentration

526
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:42,290
of drug at the effector
site because once

527
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:48,960
the drug gets to the
systemic circulation,

528
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:52,930
it will be
distributed to the

529
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:55,710
effector site,
depending of course on

530
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:57,750
its physicochemical
properties.

531
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:04,110
Now if there are only
a few molecules of

532
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:06,150
drug at the effector
site, then there

533
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:09,310
will be a smaller
effect than if there are

534
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:13,390
a gazillion, well
obviously not a gazillion,

535
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:16,690
but lots and lots
and lots of drug

536
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:19,750
molecules at the
effector site. Now why?

537
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:23,910
Because remember
about dissociation

538
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:25,870
association, association,

539
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:28,710
dissociation,
association, dissociation.

540
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:36,510
Nearly all drugs will
reversibly bind to

541
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:39,870
its target. So that
means it will associate

542
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:41,930
and the rate of
association will depend

543
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:45,270
on its structural
characteristics and it

544
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:49,290
will dissociate. So,
once it dissociates,

545
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:54,510
then another drug
molecule can occupy the

546
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:57,090
receptor site. And
when it dissociates,

547
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:59,310
another drug molecule
occupies, and it

548
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:01,810
dissociates, another
drug molecule occupies.

549
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:04,310
So if there are lots
of drug molecules

550
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:07,710
in the vicinity of
the target, there are

551
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:11,750
plenty of drug
molecules to occupy the

552
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:14,630
receptor when the
one that's there

553
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:17,430
dissociates. Now, if
there are only a few,

554
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:21,860
there may not be
a drug molecule

555
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:25,490
ready to jump
onto that site.

556
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:27,570
There's a very
important point to

557
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:30,830
understand here
with receptors and

558
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:32,830
drug molecules
and all of that.

559
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:36,290
It's a probability
that the drug

560
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:39,310
molecule will bump
into the receptor

561
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:42,810
and have enough
affinity to bind

562
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:45,190
to it. It's all
about probability.

563
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:48,450
So if there are lots
of drug molecules,

564
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:50,950
the probability
of another

565
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:53,610
drug molecule binding
is very great.

566
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:56,550
If there are only a
few drug molecules

567
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:58,490
in the vicinity, then the

568
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:01,310
probability is less.
And that's really

569
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:03,930
all there is to
this whole concept.

570
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:07,250
Drug dose determines
the concentration in

571
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:11,370
blood. blood, the drug
distributes to the

572
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:13,750
effector site, so the
concentration in the

573
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:15,910
blood determines
the concentration at

574
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:19,530
the site of action,
and how many molecules

575
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:21,550
are at the site of
action will determine

576
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:25,090
the magnitude of the
pharmacologic effect.

577
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,800
So let's talk some
more terms here.

578
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:38,800
Intrinsic activity,
the ability of a drug

579
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,320
bound to its receptor
to activate downstream

580
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:44,300
effector mechanisms.
mechanisms. So a drug

581
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:48,860
that is capable of
activating the receptor

582
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:52,100
and the receptor
activating its downstream

583
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:56,160
effector mechanisms
has intrinsic activity.

584
00:33:56,990 --> 00:34:00,400
And we talk about
intrinsic activity in

585
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:05,320
terms of does it
produce the full effect?

586
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:10,280
Then yes, then it has

587
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,940
high intrinsic activity.

588
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:15,820
Does it produce a
partial level of

589
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:18,940
effect? This is called
a partial agonist.

590
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:21,520
It does have
intrinsic activity,

591
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,670
but not as much as
the full agonist.

592
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,920
Efficacy, the
quantitative ability of a

593
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:33,000
drug to elicit a
physiologic response when it

594
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,180
interacts with a
receptor, and of course

595
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:37,600
this is related to the
intrinsic activity.

596
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:41,440
Now what I want to
point out here is the

597
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:46,140
pure pharmacology meaning
of efficacy compared

598
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:51,080
to the everyday usage
of efficacy. So,

599
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:56,060
this definition
here is the

600
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:58,400
pure pharmacology
definition.

601
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,500
Agonists have efficacy,

602
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:04,560
inhibitors do not
have efficacy.

603
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:07,680
But in everyday
language, if a drug

604
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,440
is effective, it
means it has efficacy,

605
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:14,790
it's efficacious.
So, please try

606
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:18,080
and separate the
pharmacology pure

607
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,960
definition and the
everyday meaning.

608
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,040
And believe me, you're
going to be using

609
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:27,120
efficacy, efficacious
as meaning effective,

610
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,620
and you'll be
using it for

611
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:32,820
inhibitors, agonists,
whatever drug.

612
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,260
Potency.

613
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:39,340
Potency is the
concentration of

614
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:41,560
drug required to
produce an effect.

615
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,960
And that's going
to be related to

616
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,340
the drug's affinity
for its target. So

617
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,870
we're talking about
the concentration

618
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:51,660
necessary to
produce the effect.

619
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:55,500
So we will
illustrate these

620
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,280
in the upcoming
slides. sides.

621
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:05,500
These two charts
demonstrate relative

622
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:09,380
efficacy and relative
potency. So the upper

623
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:14,100
chart is efficacy. We
see drug A and drug B

624
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:18,020
binding to the same
receptor and therefore

625
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:23,700
for the function is
the same and they have

626
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:29,100
intrinsic activity.
But drug A is a full

627
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:32,680
agonist. It produces
the maximal effect

628
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:36,200
that that receptor is
capable of producing.

629
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:41,580
Drug B produces is
some lower effect.

630
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:46,600
It has partial
activity. It is

631
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:51,380
called a partial
agonist. So they both

632
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,280
produce an effect.

633
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:55,900
They both bind to
the same receptor

634
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:58,880
so it's the same
action but it's a

635
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:03,380
different magnitude.
Full efficacy or full

636
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:06,640
effect compared
to partial effect.

637
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,250
Now, looking at
the lower two

638
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,520
curves, we have
drug C and drug D.

639
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:18,680
Drug C will produce 50%

640
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:22,960
of the response at
this concentration.

641
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,700
Whatever this is,
let's say it's

642
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:27,160
one. Let's say
it's one milligram.

643
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:32,260
Drug D will produce
the same full effect,

644
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:35,220
but it takes more
drug. It takes a

645
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:41,980
higher dose. So let's
say this is 100 mg.

646
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:50,860
The EC50 is 100 mg
to produce 50% of the

647
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:54,500
response for drug
D and drug C, 1 mg

648
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:57,420
will produce 50% of
the response. They

649
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:00,720
both produce the same
Efficacy is just a

650
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,980
matter of how much
drug is needed at the

651
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:06,800
receptor site to
produce that effect.

652
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,660
So remember potency is
related to affinity.

653
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:13,870
So a drug that requires
a lower concentration,

654
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,580
I didn't do a very
good circle there,

655
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:20,280
is going to need fewer
molecules because

656
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:23,800
it has higher
affinity. It stays

657
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,400
attached to the
receptor, it occupies the

658
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,380
receptor, for a longer
duration of time.

659
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:35,170
Its rate of
association and

660
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:38,820
its rate of,
let me back up.

661
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:43,260
The rate of dissociation
of the drug with

662
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:47,620
the higher affinity
is much longer. It

663
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:49,800
takes longer for it
to dissociate because

664
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,640
it has a high affinity
for the receptor.

665
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,720
Drug D, on the
other hand,

666
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,580
has a lower
affinity, so it will

667
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:01,740
dissociate much
more rapidly.

668
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:05,020
And it requires
more molecules

669
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,480
to be there
to jump on the

670
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,200
receptor once drug
D dissociates.

671
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,380
So that's potency.

672
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:17,400
In this example we
see dose response

673
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:20,620
curves of different
shapes and

674
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:23,940
this can have a
clinical impact.

675
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:32,560
Drug B is a partial
agonist. That's

676
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,100
easy to see here.
It does not produce

677
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:38,940
maximal efficacy
compared to A, C, and D,

678
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:43,880
which do produce
the maximal effect.

679
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,640
However,

680
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:50,840
drug B is the most
potent of these four.

681
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:55,040
The EC50 is at this
point furthest to the

682
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:59,020
left, meaning that
fewer molecules are

683
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:04,500
needed to produce the
maximal effect that drug

684
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:08,260
B is capable of. it's
a partial agonist.

685
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:15,040
Now drug A, C, and D
have EC50s approximately

686
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,060
in the same location
because they have

687
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:22,240
the same maximal
efficacy but A is more

688
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,980
potent than C which
is more potent than D.

689
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:28,180
Now I'd like to draw
your attention to

690
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:34,160
the shape of D. It
has a much steeper

691
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:38,320
slope than the other
drugs on this figure.

692
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,040
Now, what does that mean?

693
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:46,660
Let's say that the
majority of patients

694
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:48,980
achieve an effect
somewhere in this

695
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:54,820
range, and let's say
that drug D actually

696
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:57,560
has the potential
for serious toxicity.

697
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:04,200
The dose to achieve
the maximal effect is

698
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:13,590
fairly close to the
dose that is required

699
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:17,910
to achieve that will
cause the toxicity.

700
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:19,930
Let's say it's
an anesthetic and

701
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:21,970
let's say the
toxicity is coma.

702
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:29,190
It's very easy to
overshoot from the

703
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:34,370
therapeutic effect to
the toxic effect and it's

704
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:37,390
so important to understand
individual patients

705
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:43,450
risk factors for
optimization of therapy

706
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:46,050
in the individual
patient. So that's the

707
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:51,270
meaning of the steep
dose response curve.

708
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:55,830
Moving now to
spare receptors.

709
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:57,350
This is another concept.

710
00:41:57,590 --> 00:42:05,510
I had said in a very
simple example that

711
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:12,910
the effect, let me
back up a little

712
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:16,250
bit, the maximal
effect is related to

713
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:19,710
the maximal occupancy
of receptors in the

714
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:22,070
receptor pool, and
I had said that's

715
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:25,370
not always true. And
here's an example.

716
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:28,830
Receptors are said to
be spare for a given

717
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:31,350
pharmacologic response
if it is possible

718
00:42:31,350 --> 00:42:34,590
to elicit a maximal
biologic response

719
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:37,830
at a concentration
of agonists that does

720
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:41,090
not result in
occupancy of the full

721
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:43,950
complement of available
receptors. So spare,

722
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:48,190
Here, I gave you a
way to think about

723
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,970
spare, it's a
reserve supply like

724
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:53,190
a spare tire or
spare cash extra.

725
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:00,500
And we have two
curves here.

726
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:05,080
Here's our EC50,
so this is the

727
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,480
concentration at
which, that will

728
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:11,160
produce 50% of the
maximal response.

729
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,180
And here's our maximal
effect. extract.

730
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:18,820
This is the
concentration at which

731
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:22,100
50% of the
receptors are bound

732
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:25,220
with this being
the maximum number

733
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:27,500
of receptors in
the receptor pool.

734
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:36,080
The EC50 is at
one unit of drug

735
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,200
concentration
concentration,

736
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:43,000
and the KD equilibrium
dissociation constant

737
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,890
is at 10 units of
drug concentration.

738
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:49,920
So 10 times the

739
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:54,200
concentration
for, let's say,

740
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:58,700
EC50 is 1 tenth of
the concentration of

741
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:01,360
drug needed to produce
the response. So,

742
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:04,460
all of these extra
receptors, all

743
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:06,400
of this concentration
in here is

744
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,520
extra receptors
that are not bound,

745
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:12,540
but maximal effect
still occurs.

746
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:17,320
Spare receptors are
said to exist if

747
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:19,900
the maximal response
is obtained at

748
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:22,340
less than 100%
occupation of the

749
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:24,420
receptors. That's
all there is to it.

750
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,500
Only a fraction of total
receptors are needed

751
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:32,240
to elicit a maximal
response, thus the

752
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,260
remaining receptors
that are not bound by

753
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:37,600
agonists are referred
to as spare receptors.

754
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:46,220
So how can the
researcher determine if

755
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:51,520
a drug is producing
the maximal effect

756
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:54,440
at a lower
concentration than the

757
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:57,100
number of receptors
that are available.

758
00:44:57,610 --> 00:44:59,490
Well, it can be
done experimentally.

759
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:06,860
So imagine that the
researcher is injecting

760
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:12,980
an irreversible inhibitor
into the experimental

761
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:15,780
animal. So an
irreversible inhibitor

762
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:20,420
is going to bind to the
receptors and prevent

763
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:23,780
the agonist from
binding, it's inhibiting,

764
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:27,320
and it's irreversible
so it stays there.

765
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:30,160
It does not dissociate.

766
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:35,960
Now let us say that
a concentration of

767
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:38,460
agonist is injected,
this is the starting

768
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:44,640
point, and this is the
effect. So here is the

769
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:48,880
concentration, the
EC50, at which 50% of

770
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:53,560
maximal occurs with
the dose of agonist.

771
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:57,540
Now the researcher will

772
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:59,100
inject the inhibitor.

773
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:08,840
Now the researcher
needs to inject more

774
00:46:09,070 --> 00:46:13,460
agonist in order to
achieve an effect.

775
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:17,400
The full effect is
still achieved but

776
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,900
at a higher
concentration of agonist.

777
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,420
So now the researcher

778
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:26,960
injects more inhibitor.

779
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:33,240
And now it takes more,
a higher concentration

780
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:37,500
of agonist to
produce the effect

781
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:40,360
and it is a maximal
effect. So from here

782
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:45,080
to here there are
spare receptors. How

783
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:46,940
do we know? Well Well
first of all because

784
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:50,320
it's an irreversible
inhibitor so the

785
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:52,580
agonist is not
going to bind to the

786
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:54,640
receptors that the
inhibitor is bound to.

787
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:58,260
So there are still
some spare receptors

788
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:00,660
around in order
for the agonist to

789
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:02,800
bind to and produce
a maximal effect.

790
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:05,420
Now the researcher

791
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:09,340
introduces
more inhibitor.

792
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:12,300
inhibitor.

793
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:16,170
And then more agonists,
ah, but the receptors

794
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:19,700
are more and more bound
by that inhibitor.

795
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:22,660
So they're getting
closer and closer and

796
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:26,480
closer to maximal
binding by the inhibitor.

797
00:47:27,230 --> 00:47:28,560
So we only get the

798
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:30,360
partial effect.
And again,

799
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:33,360
more receptors are
bound, a partial effect,

800
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,600
and if it were to
keep going, eventually

801
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:38,520
there would be no
effect by the agonist

802
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:41,160
because all of the
receptors are bound.

803
00:47:50,330 --> 00:47:52,250
So in conclusion,

804
00:47:52,410 --> 00:47:56,070
we're going to
look at some terms.

805
00:47:57,130 --> 00:47:58,870
I'd like you to match the

806
00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:02,270
terms to the
descriptions.

807
00:48:02,490 --> 00:48:05,870
So I invite you to
pause your computer

808
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:08,310
and see if you can
come up with the

809
00:48:08,310 --> 00:48:10,870
answers. All of the
terms are on the bottom

810
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:15,670
and match them to
their definitions.

811
00:48:17,290 --> 00:48:19,990
Alright, so you've
turned your computer

812
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:24,730
back on and let's see
what the answers are.

813
00:48:26,090 --> 00:48:27,690
Actions of the
body on the

814
00:48:27,690 --> 00:48:29,270
drug, pharmacokinetics.

815
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:32,970
The body is acting
on the drug to

816
00:48:32,970 --> 00:48:36,230
cause it to be
absorbed, distributed,

817
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:37,970
metabolized,
and excreted.

818
00:48:38,330 --> 00:48:39,630
What are the actions of

819
00:48:39,630 --> 00:48:40,850
the drug on the body?

820
00:48:43,110 --> 00:48:45,850
Pharmacodynamics,
the drug is

821
00:48:45,850 --> 00:48:48,790
causing some kind
of an effect or

822
00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:50,650
blocking some
kind of an effect.

823
00:48:50,730 --> 00:48:52,850
The branch of
science that deals

824
00:48:52,850 --> 00:48:55,310
with the undesirable
effects of

825
00:48:55,310 --> 00:48:57,050
chemicals on the
living system.

826
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:01,750
Toxicity, toxicology.

827
00:49:01,870 --> 00:49:04,490
The development
of drugs based on

828
00:49:04,490 --> 00:49:06,530
knowledge of the
three-dimensional

829
00:49:06,530 --> 00:49:09,550
structure of the
receptor side. So

830
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:11,890
this is the drug
development side.

831
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:17,550
And that's called
rational drug design. And

832
00:49:17,550 --> 00:49:21,130
it's actually computer
-based. The drug

833
00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:24,550
development company runs
a bunch of structures

834
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:28,030
through the computer
looking for a hit.

835
00:49:28,570 --> 00:49:31,290
The relation of
the individual's

836
00:49:31,290 --> 00:49:33,010
genetic makeup to his or

837
00:49:33,010 --> 00:49:35,370
her response to
specific drugs.

838
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:38,370
Let's see if you
can figure this

839
00:49:38,370 --> 00:49:40,370
out just from
the description.

840
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:44,190
Well, of course, it must
be pharmacogenomics,

841
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:46,890
it has genetics right
there in the name.

842
00:49:47,550 --> 00:49:49,690
The science of
substances used to

843
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:52,190
prevent, diagnose,
and treat disease.

844
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:57,050
Prevent, diagnose, and
treat disease, well

845
00:49:57,050 --> 00:50:00,190
that's medicine. medicine,
medical pharmacology,

846
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:04,170
the specific molecule
in the biologic

847
00:50:04,170 --> 00:50:07,410
system that plays a
regulatory role, the

848
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:10,710
receptor, and of course
the last one is the drug,

849
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:12,450
a substance introduced
to the body that

850
00:50:12,450 --> 00:50:15,290
brings about a change
in biologic function

851
00:50:15,290 --> 00:50:18,590
through its interactions
with body components.

852
00:50:21,270 --> 00:50:23,750
This is a preview
for the next

853
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:28,690
lecture and also
looking back at a couple

854
00:50:28,690 --> 00:50:30,130
of things that
we talked about.

855
00:50:31,870 --> 00:50:34,490
So I invite you to
pause your computer and

856
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:36,510
see if you can come
up with the matches.

857
00:50:39,230 --> 00:50:40,570
So now you're back.

858
00:50:40,890 --> 00:50:43,230
A drug that binds
to and activates

859
00:50:43,230 --> 00:50:45,410
a receptor but
does not evoke a

860
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:47,450
maximal response,
no No matter how

861
00:50:47,450 --> 00:50:49,530
high the
concentration of drug.

862
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:53,820
A partial agonist.

863
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:57,650
A drug that binds a
receptor, competes with,

864
00:50:57,650 --> 00:51:00,750
and prevents binding
by other molecules.

865
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:06,070
That's an antagonist.

866
00:51:07,530 --> 00:51:10,270
The relative
ability of a drug

867
00:51:10,270 --> 00:51:12,550
receptor complex
to produce the

868
00:51:12,550 --> 00:51:15,170
maximal functional
response.

869
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:22,530
Intrinsic Efficacy
A drug that has

870
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:24,710
a much stronger
affinity for the

871
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:32,630
inactive shape of
of the receptor than

872
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:36,810
for the active
conformation state,

873
00:51:36,810 --> 00:51:40,530
and stabilizes a
large fraction of

874
00:51:41,690 --> 00:51:44,590
the inactivated
conformation drug

875
00:51:44,590 --> 00:51:49,430
pool, reducing
constitutive activity.

876
00:51:49,430 --> 00:51:51,610
Now if you didn't get
this, I don't blame

877
00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:53,870
you, we'll talk about
it in the next lecture.

878
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:58,810
This is called an
inverse agonist. In the

879
00:51:58,810 --> 00:52:00,810
absence of any
agonist, some of the

880
00:52:00,810 --> 00:52:03,670
receptor pool must exist
in the activated form

881
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:06,490
some of the time and
may produce the same

882
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:09,630
physiologic effect
as an agonist induced

883
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:13,230
activity. And this is
called constitutive

884
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:16,670
activity, or as
they say in certain

885
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:19,610
parts of the country
constitutive activity.

886
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:22,970
A drug that binds
to and activates the

887
00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:25,750
receptor in some fashion,
which directly or

888
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:27,770
indirectly directly
brings about the effect.

889
00:52:30,210 --> 00:52:31,570
An agonist.

890
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:36,070
A drug that directly
activates a receptor

891
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:38,890
by binding to a
receptor site different

892
00:52:38,890 --> 00:52:41,830
or distinct from
the primary site. So

893
00:52:41,830 --> 00:52:45,000
that's going to be an
allosteric activator.

894
00:52:45,430 --> 00:52:48,130
And finally, a drug
that binds a receptor

895
00:52:48,130 --> 00:52:50,590
at a site distinct
from the primary site

896
00:52:50,590 --> 00:52:53,290
inhibits the action
of the agonist, and

897
00:52:53,290 --> 00:52:55,730
is not overcome by
increasing the dose of

898
00:52:55,730 --> 00:52:59,030
the agonist, is an
allosteric inhibitor.

899
00:53:01,770 --> 00:53:06,890
So in summary,
pharmacodynamics is

900
00:53:06,890 --> 00:53:09,110
the study of the
biochemical, cellular,

901
00:53:09,110 --> 00:53:10,670
and physiologic
effects of drugs

902
00:53:10,670 --> 00:53:12,530
and their mechanisms
of action, what

903
00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:15,630
the drug does to
the body, and how.

904
00:53:16,250 --> 00:53:17,630
Pharmacokinetics
is the study

905
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:19,250
of the movement
and fate of

906
00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:20,870
drugs in the
body, absorption,

907
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:24,250
metabolism, excretion,
what the body

908
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:27,070
does to the drug,
and how it does it.

909
00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:29,970
Knowledge of
biochemical, cellular,

910
00:53:29,970 --> 00:53:32,490
physiologic, and
pathologic processes is

911
00:53:32,490 --> 00:53:35,850
essential for
understanding pharmacology,

912
00:53:35,850 --> 00:53:38,290
pharmacodynamics,
pharmacokinetics.

913
00:53:38,630 --> 00:53:41,270
Knowledge of
pharmacology is essential

914
00:53:41,270 --> 00:53:44,370
for the safe and
effective use

915
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:46,930
of drugs. That's
the whole point,

916
00:53:47,050 --> 00:53:48,910
optimizing drug therapy

917
00:53:48,910 --> 00:53:51,550
in the individual
patient.

918
00:53:52,510 --> 00:53:54,730
And I put this
little scheme

919
00:53:54,730 --> 00:53:57,570
here, this little
mind map, to

920
00:53:57,570 --> 00:54:01,050
help you visualize
the concepts.

921
00:54:03,550 --> 00:54:05,650
The physical chemical
characteristics

922
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:07,670
of a drug determines
its ability to

923
00:54:07,670 --> 00:54:09,890
move through the
body and initiate a

924
00:54:09,890 --> 00:54:12,630
cellular effect.
the physicochemical

925
00:54:12,630 --> 00:54:15,390
characteristics of
a drug that predict

926
00:54:15,390 --> 00:54:18,550
its movement,
predict its movement.

927
00:54:18,690 --> 00:54:21,790
And availability at
sites of action are

928
00:54:21,790 --> 00:54:24,430
its molecular size,
shape, chirality,

929
00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:28,200
degree of ionization,
relative lipid solubility

930
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:31,610
of its ionized and
non-ionized forms,

931
00:54:31,910 --> 00:54:35,990
and the relative
lipid solubility if it

932
00:54:35,990 --> 00:54:39,130
doesn't have any
ionization. The structure

933
00:54:39,130 --> 00:54:41,530
activity relationship
is the relationship

934
00:54:41,530 --> 00:54:43,730
between the chemical
or 3D structure

935
00:54:43,730 --> 00:54:46,850
of a molecule and the
biologic activity.

936
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:49,310
The interaction
of a drug with its

937
00:54:49,310 --> 00:54:52,030
receptor is the
fundamental event that

938
00:54:52,030 --> 00:54:55,110
initiates the
action of the drug.

939
00:54:55,190 --> 00:54:58,710
And I've given you
some pictures here of

940
00:54:58,710 --> 00:55:01,470
different types of
receptors and actions.

941
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:06,270
Drugs interact with
receptors to produce

942
00:55:06,270 --> 00:55:08,850
a change in the state,
the confirmation,

943
00:55:09,270 --> 00:55:11,010
of the receptor which

944
00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:14,130
transduces a
physiologic effect.

945
00:55:14,530 --> 00:55:16,890
The molecular
action with the

946
00:55:16,890 --> 00:55:19,430
receptor can be
modeled mathematically

947
00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:23,610
and obeys the law
of mass action.

948
00:55:23,990 --> 00:55:26,010
The binding of a
drug and receptor

949
00:55:26,010 --> 00:55:28,330
determines the
quantitative relationship

950
00:55:28,330 --> 00:55:31,490
between the dose
and the effect.

951
00:55:33,190 --> 00:55:35,290
Mutual affinity of
drug and receptor

952
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:37,170
determines the
quantitative

953
00:55:37,170 --> 00:55:40,610
relationship between
dose and effect.

954
00:55:44,110 --> 00:55:46,670
Traditional receptor
occupancy theory

955
00:55:46,670 --> 00:55:48,930
rests on the
assumption that the

956
00:55:48,930 --> 00:55:51,710
proportion of occupied
receptors is related

957
00:55:51,710 --> 00:55:54,410
to the effect of
the drug. For full

958
00:55:54,410 --> 00:55:57,950
agonists, 100%
occupancy produces the

959
00:55:57,950 --> 00:56:00,930
maximal effect, a
linear relationship.

960
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:05,130
For some receptors, a
biologic response may

961
00:56:05,130 --> 00:56:09,110
be achieved before full
receptor occupancy.

962
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:11,190
The fraction
of unoccupied

963
00:56:11,190 --> 00:56:14,170
receptors is called
spare receptors.

964
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:19,290
And here are the
answers to the matching.

965
00:56:19,950 --> 00:56:22,610
