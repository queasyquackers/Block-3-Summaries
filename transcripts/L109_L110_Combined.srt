00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:04,690
Hello students. Welcome
to Pharmacokinetics.

2
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:06,910
We will be
talking about the

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:10,310
properties of
absorption, distribution,

4
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:13,530
metabolism, and
excretion. In this first

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,110
part, it will just
be absorption and

6
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:18,850
distribution. Dr.
Goldstein speaking.

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,070
Please contact
me if you'd

8
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:25,830
like a pharmacology chat.

9
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:32,570
Recall the pharmacokinetics
pharmacodynamics

10
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:35,230
relationship. The drug
gets into the body,

11
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:38,870
gets distributed, goes
to the pharmacologic

12
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:43,210
site of action, produces
its effect, whether

13
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,310
it's a therapeutic
effect or an adverse

14
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:48,350
effect. There is some
sort of a clinical

15
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:53,430
response And that could
be effectiveness, the

16
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:57,370
goal, or toxicity,
something to be minimized.

17
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:02,850
The processes of
pharmacokinetics are

18
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:08,570
absorption, indicated here
by input, distribution,

19
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,950
and elimination. So
elimination would be

20
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:15,990
biotransformation, in
other words, metabolism

21
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:22,810
to an inactive
metabolite or excreted.

22
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:28,740
The key factor?

23
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:34,490
Concentration. The
concentration in the

24
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:37,410
plasma will determine
the concentration at

25
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:41,330
the site of action and
that will determine

26
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:44,830
the magnitude of the
pharmacologic effect.

27
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:50,070
So,

28
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:53,990
how important really
is pharmacokinetics?

29
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:57,670
It is the pharmacokinetic
properties of

30
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:02,310
drugs that influence
efficacy and safety.

31
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:07,030
The goal of therapy
is to increase the

32
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:09,530
probability of therapeutic
success, and this

33
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:12,270
is going to depend
on the dose and

34
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:15,250
certain other factors,
and to reduce the

35
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,630
occurrence of adverse
effects in the body.

36
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:21,550
Sometimes we can't
stop them, but we can

37
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:25,570
at least minimize them
and mitigate them.

38
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:31,030
Here are the
learning objectives,

39
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,590
and it's all related to

40
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,770
mechanisms,
mechanisms, mechanisms.

41
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:39,210
Please read these over.

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,670
You don't need me
to read them to you.

43
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:46,790
Preparation materials.

44
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,890
The only thing
that I require

45
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:50,550
is the practice
questions.

46
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:56,230
These are case vignettes
and thought problems.

47
00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:00,630
I will help you
to apply the basic

48
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:05,690
concepts of pharmacology
through practice

49
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:08,870
questions. And when you
receive the answers,

50
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,590
then you will
see the thought

51
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,530
processes and
this will help you

52
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:17,170
to really learn
pharmacology.

53
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:21,170
Here are some
resources if you

54
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:23,070
choose to use them.
I provided the

55
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,710
links. They are
all available.

56
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,170
These textbook
resources are all

57
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:34,650
available in our
medical library.

58
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:41,770
I've provided
some hints to help

59
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:45,250
you to actually
master a topic

60
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:49,470
to avoid the
illusion of knowing.

61
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:54,330
You may find them
helpful as you go

62
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:57,910
through this difficult
material. The material

63
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:00,050
itself isn't
difficult, it's just

64
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:02,230
that you get so much
of it all at once.

65
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:06,930
And here are some tips.

66
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:11,590
I really would like
you to try them out.

67
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,930
Rephrase the main
ideas in your own

68
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:19,660
words. It's about
your own words.

69
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:24,210
You can make a
question out of them.

70
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,770
That helps you
think about it.

71
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:30,170
Relate the ideas
to what you

72
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:32,950
already know and
that will help

73
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:36,430
make it stick
in your brain.

74
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,230
And here are
some techniques.

75
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:47,890
The definitions
are here to help

76
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:50,470
you with the language
of pharmacology,

77
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:52,610
the language of medicine.

78
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:56,730
More terms.

79
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:01,710
I've provided this
overview of really

80
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:04,210
of what you need to
know and understand.

81
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:08,530
So you can focus
on these concepts

82
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:12,150
and that will answer
your question of

83
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,310
what do I need to
know for the test.

84
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:18,050
And I have several slides

85
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:20,410
of concepts for you.

86
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,790
So let us begin.

87
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:35,770
The basic idea is
a drug is given at

88
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:39,330
some particular dose.
And how do we know

89
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:41,830
what dose to give?
We look it up in the

90
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:44,270
drug monograph and
that will guide us.

91
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:49,090
But we still have to
remember about our

92
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:52,190
individual patient and
there may need to be

93
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:54,890
adjustments of the doses
that are recommended.

94
00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:02,850
In the case of oral
drugs especially, they

95
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:05,970
have to be liberated
out of their tablet or

96
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:08,830
capsule or whatever
form they're going in.

97
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:17,370
And then the drug
itself must be absorbed.

98
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:21,250
If we're giving
it by intravenous

99
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,570
administration, it's just

100
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:24,150
going straight
into the vein.

101
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:29,090
An oral drug needs to

102
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:30,590
pass through the liver

103
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:35,930
and then it will
go to the central

104
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:39,470
compartment, and that
is the bloodstream

105
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:42,130
and the highly
perfused organs.

106
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:45,390
If it is an IV
drug, it just goes

107
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,570
straight into the
central compartment.

108
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:53,850
Once there, the free
drug will then move

109
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:59,050
to the site of
action, move to be

110
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:02,770
stuck on tissue
macromolecules, they call

111
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:05,910
that tissue
reservoirs, can move to

112
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:09,430
areas that are not the
therapeutic target,

113
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,950
but rather produce
adverse effects.

114
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:15,430
Notice these
two-way arrows.

115
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:19,810
The drug will move in and

116
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:23,130
out, in and
out, in and out.

117
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:31,110
the drug can be bound
to plasma proteins

118
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:34,770
and if it's bound to
plasma proteins it will

119
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:39,050
be riding around on
the protein bus in

120
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:43,010
the bloodstream and it
will not move to the

121
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:45,550
site of action until
it gets off the bus.

122
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:51,950
It can bind to the same
idea of these inert

123
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,690
molecules in the tissues,
the same concept.

124
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:04,350
Even an IV drug or
anything that bypasses

125
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:07,310
the liver first and
goes to the central

126
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:10,090
compartment will
certainly pass through the

127
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:14,580
liver where it will
undergo metabolism.

128
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:19,110
And then the
metabolites, and that can

129
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:21,610
include a metabolite
that's actually

130
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:26,090
active, toxic or
inactive, will move into

131
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:28,370
the central compartment
again from the

132
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:30,710
liver where it will
go to be excreted,

133
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:34,610
but it may also be
excreted straight

134
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:41,130
out of the liver to
the biliary system.

135
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:46,130
So that's another
route of excretion.

136
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:50,550
So this very simple
figure really

137
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:54,630
sums up absorption,
distribution,

138
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:57,990
metabolism, and
excretion, and

139
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:00,830
how all are related
to each other.

140
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:08,810
A drug must withstand
digestive fluids

141
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:11,010
and enzymes. We're
talking about drugs

142
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:13,870
that are swallowed
into the GI tract and

143
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:16,770
the digestive fluids
and enzymes are in

144
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:21,910
the stomach. The drug
must move into the

145
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:24,990
intestine where it
will be absorbed and

146
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:27,910
once it's absorbed
it has and once it's

147
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,970
the intestine it has
to be able to cross

148
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:33,730
the physiologic
barriers to be absorbed

149
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:37,630
and to be distributed

150
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,150
to the site of action.

151
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:44,690
The drug must be
able to exit the

152
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:46,690
site of action
after providing

153
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:49,210
the specific
therapeutic effect

154
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:54,010
and it must be
eliminated either by

155
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,170
metabolism to inactive
metabolites which is

156
00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:02,210
certainly the most
common, or it actually

157
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:06,890
may be metabolized to
an active metabolite

158
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:10,370
or a toxic metabolite.
In any case,

159
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:15,430
if it's metabolized to
an active metabolite,

160
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:19,030
that will terminate
the drug effect,

161
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:23,270
and that is equivalent
to elimination

162
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:27,910
via metabolism.

163
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:35,690
The drug needs to
be excreted and this

164
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:40,610
is by far most frequently
via the kidney.

165
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:41,830
By far.

166
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:45,890
In the kidney,

167
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:49,850
through the kidney,
inactive metabolites

168
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:53,910
or unchanged drug
may pass through

169
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:57,890
or active metabolites
may pass through

170
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:03,470
and then be excreted
via the urine.

171
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,670
Let's begin with
absorption. The movement

172
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:12,010
of substances
across physiologic

173
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:15,430
barriers into the
central circulation and

174
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,630
of course we're talking
about the drugs.

175
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,850
There are a
number of ways to

176
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:24,330
pass through
physiologic barriers.

177
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:29,310
Passive diffusion
through the membrane,

178
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:35,450
the lipophilic
membrane, is the most

179
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:40,650
frequent method
of diffusion, of

180
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:43,650
passage through the
physiologic barriers.

181
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:47,190
Other mechanisms that
many drugs may be

182
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:50,910
using are through
transporters. So we see all

183
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,270
these various types
of transporters listed

184
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:56,030
here. I won't go into
it now because I'll

185
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:58,850
be talking about that
a little bit later.

186
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:02,370
Another way is for
molecules that are

187
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:07,530
dissolved in the plasma,
small molecules, can

188
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:11,910
pass between cells,
paracellular transport,

189
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:14,430
by solvent drag.

190
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:20,550
So first let's
talk about passive

191
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:23,010
diffusion of the
lipid-soluble

192
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:26,790
drugs across
cell membranes.

193
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:32,670
The key driver is
the concentration

194
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:35,790
gradient. The
drug will pass

195
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:39,390
down an area of
high concentration

196
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,290
to an area of low
concentration.

197
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:50,570
When the number of
molecules on one side

198
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,910
equals the number
of molecules on the

199
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:58,850
other side, It will be
in a dynamic equilibrium,

200
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:09,250
and there will be
no net movement.

201
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:18,830
The rate, in
pharmacokinetics, we're

202
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:22,770
talking about rate,
and we will also talk

203
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:26,230
about the extent,
how much, how fast

204
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:29,410
and how much the
drug molecules move.

205
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:33,630
So the rate and
extent of the flow of

206
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:35,710
the drug molecules
are influenced by

207
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,570
the magnitude of
the concentration

208
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:40,570
gradient across the
membrane. The greater

209
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,970
the gradient, the
faster the rate.

210
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:47,230
The lipid water
partition coefficient

211
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:50,390
of the drug will
determine its ability

212
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:54,090
to get through
this lipid layer.

213
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:59,470
The membrane surface
area of the drug,

214
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:06,270
so how much of the
membrane is available

215
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:10,070
for passage? Is
it a large amount

216
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:13,510
or is it just
maybe, let's use the

217
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:16,330
other side, just
maybe a small amount?

218
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:20,410
the permeability of the

219
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:23,470
membrane and
the thickness.

220
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:26,670
If it's a thick
membrane, let's make a

221
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:30,710
thick membrane, versus
a thin membrane, it

222
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:32,770
will take longer to
pass through the thick

223
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:36,190
membrane than thin
membrane. So all kinds

224
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:39,610
of different features
of the membrane

225
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:42,810
determine the rate and
extent of the flow.

226
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:50,130
This is the basic
concept that describes

227
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:53,930
the movement of drug
across the membrane,

228
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:56,910
across the physiologic
barrier. You do not

229
00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:01,310
need to memorize
this equation, this

230
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:06,090
relationship, but you
should recognize, This is

231
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:09,010
the takeaway, that
diffusion across the lipid

232
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:12,390
bilayer of cell
membranes depends on the

233
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:15,970
drug's lipid water
partition coefficient.

234
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:19,170
And that is going
to determine how

235
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:21,730
readily the drug
enters the lipid

236
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:24,510
membrane from the
aqueous medium.

237
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:29,390
It's related to
the concentration

238
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:31,910
gradient, the area, the

239
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,970
permeability, and
the thickness.

240
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:39,530
of the drug and
the membrane.

241
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:45,410
Weak acids and weak
bases, the Henderson

242
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:48,870
-Hasselbalch equation
and ion trapping.

243
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:54,570
For weak acids and
weak bases, the pKa

244
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:57,210
of the drug and the
pH of the medium

245
00:15:57,210 --> 00:16:00,190
determine the ratio
of molecules in

246
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:03,650
the charged or
ionized form compared

247
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:07,670
to the uncharged and
non-ionized form.

248
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:10,310
Here is the key.

249
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:18,630
The uncharged, non
-ionized form is the more

250
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:24,330
lipid-soluble form of
the drug. So a weak

251
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:27,330
acid and weak bases
dissociate in fluid.

252
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:30,570
They dissociate to
an uncharged form and

253
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:33,970
a charged form. It
is the uncharged form

254
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:37,150
that will pass
through the membranes.

255
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:42,130
Now, a greater
fraction of the weak

256
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:45,870
acid will be in the
lipid-soluble form

257
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:53,690
in the more acidic
medium, where the

258
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:58,250
pH is lower than
the pKa of the drug.

259
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:02,070
A greater fraction
of the weak base

260
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:05,450
will be in the lipid
-soluble B form, you

261
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:07,270
notice there's no
proton on there,

262
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:11,610
in a more alkaline
medium where the pH

263
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:16,170
is greater than the
pKa of the drug.

264
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,930
I'm sure you're familiar
with the Henderson

265
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:22,050
-Hasselbalch equation.
What we're looking at

266
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:28,110
in pharmacology is the
ratio of the unprotonated

267
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:31,390
form to the protonated
form. How much

268
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:35,530
of the drug, of a weak
acid or weak base,

269
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:40,810
is going to pass through
the lipid membrane?

270
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:44,030
We know the pH.

271
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:48,330
pH is very in the
body. We think about

272
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:51,590
plasma as 7.4, plasma
and interstitial

273
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:54,330
fluids as 7.4, so
we know the pH,

274
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:57,210
and we know the
pKa of the drug, so

275
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:01,450
that leaves the ratio
to be determined.

276
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,390
To repeat,

277
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:08,150
the lower the pH
relative to the

278
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:11,250
pKa, the greater
will be the fraction

279
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:14,390
of drug in the
protonated form.

280
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:21,350
Weak acids are
not ionized when

281
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,550
they're protonated
and that's indicated

282
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:26,470
by A for acid
and H for proton.

283
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:32,270
Weak bases are
ionized when they are

284
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:36,730
protonated. B for
base and H for proton.

285
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,910
Key concept.

286
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:44,610
Here it is illustrated.

287
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:47,750
We have our
lipid bilayer.

288
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:52,130
We have our different
body compartments.

289
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:57,350
The non-ionized
form of the, sorry,

290
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:59,390
the ionized form of
the acid indicated

291
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:03,230
located by A- will
not pass through.

292
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:07,270
The HA form will
pass through.

293
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:09,230
Here it is on
the other side,

294
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:12,270
dissociating
dependent on the

295
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:15,610
pKa and the pH
of the fluid in

296
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:17,590
the body
compartment it's in.

297
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,730
Weak base,

298
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:24,050
the protonated form
will not pass through.

299
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:27,450
The non-protonated
B form will

300
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:29,970
pass through and
same concept,

301
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,550
just the weak
base this time.

302
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:38,020
This figure here
at the top shows

303
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:42,010
the pKa right here
in the middle.

304
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:48,090
When the pH equals
the pKa then And the

305
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:53,470
both forms, the
ionized and non-ionized

306
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:56,240
forms, are in equal
concentration.

307
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:04,770
Let's say the pKa
of the weak acid is

308
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:07,590
right here. It doesn't
have to be right

309
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:11,530
here. Let's say it's
right here. Then we

310
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:16,050
have an increasing
amount of the ionized

311
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:19,770
form as we move up.
An increasing amount

312
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:23,090
of the non-ionized
form as we move down.

313
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:29,230
But very few areas
in the body have a pH

314
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:32,450
so low. The one
exception is the stomach.

315
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:35,950
Let's say we have a weak

316
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:37,770
base of, let's say here.

317
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:43,270
then the majority
of it will be in the

318
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:49,090
ionized form BH
plus but as the pH

319
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:51,710
increases the majority
will be in the B

320
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:57,930
non-ionized form but
there the pH is in

321
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:00,870
this area are
incompatible with life.

322
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:06,830
To repeat non-ionized
molecules diffuse

323
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:09,230
used readily across
the membrane.

324
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:16,880
So what do we do
with this information

325
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,530
in terms of the
clinical utilization

326
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:23,250
of it? It's all
very interesting.

327
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:28,430
It's called ion
trapping. Trapping

328
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:32,590
of the ionized
form in a fluid

329
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:35,590
for the purpose, usually,

330
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:38,350
of increasing the rate of

331
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:41,510
excretion of a
toxic compound.

332
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:48,050
We can also talk
about it in terms of

333
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:51,110
how much drug is
going to be excreted

334
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:55,930
in a particular pH
of urine versus how

335
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:58,110
much will stay
in. That can be

336
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:00,590
therapeutically important,
but not commonly.

337
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:05,130
Starting on the
left-hand side.

338
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:09,210
Blood pH, 7.4.

339
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:18,210
A drug in concentration
of one micromolar

340
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:24,230
in the non-protonated
form. This is a weak

341
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:26,390
base we're talking
about in this example.

342
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:33,490
and the pH with this
example which I took

343
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:39,070
from the basic and clinical
pharmacology review

344
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:44,450
book it is a weight
base with a pK of 7.0

345
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:50,730
the tendency
is to be in the

346
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:53,970
non-ionized non
-protonated form

347
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:59,790
and we still of course
get a certain amount

348
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:03,170
in the protonated form
so between the two

349
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:08,050
we have one micromole
and the non-protonated

350
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:12,210
0.4 micromole and the
protonated and here's

351
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:17,270
the total it is one
drug after all the non

352
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:20,310
-protonated form readily
crosses the membrane

353
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:23,850
you see here it can
cross both directions.

354
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:27,830
The pH of the urine,
however, is 6.0 in

355
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:30,410
this example, which
is pretty common.

356
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,070
Urine tends to be acidic.

357
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:36,450
And we see this
thicker arrow

358
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:42,430
pointing towards
the protonated form.

359
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:49,690
Lower pH, more of
the molecule of this

360
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:52,570
weak base will be in
the protonated form.

361
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:55,510
So, we still have
1 micromole of

362
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:57,990
the non-protonated,
but we have 11

363
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:02,370
micromoles of the
protonated form.

364
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:05,910
Therefore, we
have a greater

365
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:07,930
amount that's
not passing back

366
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:13,650
through, indicated
by this arrow.

367
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:16,830
And it will
pass out through

368
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,050
the urine and
be excreted.

369
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:26,090
It's a basic idea
of ion trapping.

370
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:29,830
This is actually
a strategy used

371
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:34,530
most frequently for
salicylate toxicity.

372
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:36,890
And salicylate
is a weak acid.

373
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:40,750
So the whole
idea then would

374
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:49,170
be to increase
urine pH to 7 or

375
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:51,770
8, as high as
we can get it,

376
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:54,810
so that we can trap
the salicylate in the

377
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:57,350
urine and excrete it
at a greater rate.

378
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:02,250
Let's talk about
transporters now.

379
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,710
That's another way for
drugs to pass through

380
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:07,950
physiologic barriers.
Not all drugs have

381
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:11,450
the lipid solubility
to be able to actually

382
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:14,000
pass through the
bilayer. So there are

383
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,270
transporters. And these
transporters, of course,

384
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:20,630
are present because our
natural body processes

385
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:23,810
require them, but the
drugs use them also.

386
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:24,990
Now,

387
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:27,870
membrane transporters
are selective,

388
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:31,310
so a drug must
actually need to be a

389
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:35,670
substrate of the
transporter in order

390
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:38,630
for it to pass through
the transporter.

391
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,250
and it is selective
for a specific

392
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:46,050
conformational
structure of the

393
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:48,210
drug. That's
basically what we're

394
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:51,170
talking about,
being a substrate.

395
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:55,390
They are saturable
because they are

396
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:58,530
doors. They are
doors across the

397
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:02,750
membrane and if
they're busy, then

398
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:04,790
other drugs can't
pass through them.

399
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:12,190
their expression can be
increased or decreased

400
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:16,610
just like metabolic
enzymes they are

401
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:20,710
subject to competitive
inhibition as i said before

402
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:24,070
if they are busy
another substrate is not

403
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:26,150
going to be able to
pass through it because

404
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:30,910
it's busy it's saturated
all of them saturated

405
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:33,630
It's not just one
transporter, there are

406
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:36,550
probably hundreds of
thousands, at least.

407
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:40,730
It is also subject
to non-competitive

408
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:43,650
inhibition. In other
words, a drug that

409
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:47,210
binds to an allosteric
site can change

410
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:49,490
the conformation of
the transporter such

411
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:52,170
that the substrate
is unable to bind.

412
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:55,930
Excuse me, I pushed
the wrong button.

413
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:59,130
Genetic variance.

414
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:03,110
Well we all have our
certain appearances

415
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:07,670
based on our genes
and the transporters

416
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:11,530
can be subject
to mutations that

417
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:14,670
increase or decrease
their effects.

418
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:20,250
There is a potential
for adverse effects

419
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:25,370
and drug interactions
based on the fact

420
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:29,050
that they can be
induced, down-regulated,

421
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:31,710
competitive inhibition,
non-competitive

422
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:34,810
inhibition, and
genetic variants.

423
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:42,130
This figure
here shows that

424
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:44,950
transporters really
are everywhere.

425
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:49,430
There are two major
families, the SLC

426
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:53,250
or solute carrier
family. These are

427
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:55,670
the carrier proteins,
the channels,

428
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:58,310
secondary active
transporters.

429
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:03,260
The carrier proteins
and channels just allow

430
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:07,710
passive diffusion,
facilitative diffusion

431
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:11,090
and passive diffusion,
down the concentration

432
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:15,070
gradient without the
requirement of energy.

433
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:18,690
The drug molecule just
moves through until

434
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:22,450
the concentrations on
both sides are equal.

435
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:26,190
And then it
would be no net

436
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:29,890
movement, a dynamic
equilibrium.

437
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:33,910
And I'm writing this

438
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:35,510
again so you
don't forget.

439
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:40,730
Secondary active
transporters are the type

440
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:46,070
where two or more
substances will use that

441
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:49,130
same transporter. One
substance, frequently

442
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:51,990
sodium, moves down its
concentration gradient,

443
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:54,250
in this case
electrochemical gradient,

444
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:56,910
that supplies the
energy for the

445
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:58,730
movement of
another substance.

446
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:04,950
And the ABC
superfamily, ATP.

447
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:07,950
All you have to really
remember is AATP.

448
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:12,490
AATP. ATP
requires energy.

449
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:14,050
I mean, it
supplies energy.

450
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:17,910
for primary
active transport

451
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:20,850
against the
concentration gradient.

452
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:29,050
The ATPase is the
enzyme that catalyzes

453
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:34,210
ATP hydrolysis supplying
the energy. The

454
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:44,910
ABC superfamily
of primary active

455
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:51,010
transporters provide active
efflux of xenobiotics,

456
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:53,010
products that we
put into our body

457
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:56,690
that are not natural
to the body and get

458
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:59,830
pushed back against
the concentration

459
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:04,460
gradient. A typical
example would be the

460
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:07,210
intestine, where the
drug goes into the

461
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:10,190
epithelial cells
and gets pushed back

462
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:13,450
into the lumen. It
should go like this.

463
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:17,090
And the liver.

464
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:25,170
There are active
transporters for biliary

465
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:29,090
excretion to push them
out of the hepatocytes

466
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:32,350
into the biliary
system. for excretion.

467
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:35,290
Kidney, same thing. Blood

468
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:39,170
-brain barrier,
and on and on.

469
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:44,630
Point out this
little figure

470
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:46,850
here. This is,
I believe, to

471
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:48,790
represent the
placental barrier,

472
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:51,430
but I could be
wrong about that.

473
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:53,210
Maybe you can tell.

474
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:01,600
Here we have figures
of the various types of

475
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:06,080
transporters. We have
carrier protein and

476
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:12,640
facilitated transport
channel, all these

477
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:17,660
various solute carrier
types of transporters for

478
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:20,420
passive transport,
facilitated transport.

479
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:25,820
And our active
transporters, this is called

480
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:30,180
a sodium potassium
ATPase, and that is

481
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:34,920
the motor that powers
active transport.

482
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,260
Here's our ATP,

483
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,420
goes to ADP,
releases that

484
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:41,820
phosphate with energy.

485
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:47,320
This is an example
of ion channels,

486
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:51,640
sodium ATPase
again, sodium

487
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:54,280
potassium ATPase
supplying the power,

488
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:59,160
sodium then goes down
the concentration

489
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,860
gradient and that
supplies the energy

490
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,980
for the movement,
in this case of

491
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:10,300
bicarbonate, and in
this case of an active,

492
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:13,180
sorry, this is an
antipower, it goes the

493
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,500
different direction,
the opposite

494
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,950
direction. And this is
some other molecule.

495
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,780
Passive transport,
secondary active

496
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:26,580
transport, and primary
active transport.

497
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:33,460
The p-glycoprotein
is one of

498
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:36,760
the most well
-studied ATPases.

499
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:43,640
It is, this is a
picture of it. You don't

500
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,680
have to memorize
what it looks like.

501
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,980
You don't have to
recreate that. What you

502
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:51,260
do need to know is
that P-glycoprotein

503
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:56,620
is an ATP-dependent
pump, active efflux

504
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:59,340
of drugs from the
cell. We'll be talking

505
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:02,260
about this over and
over and over and

506
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:04,880
over because it
is essential for

507
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,700
understanding certain
drug-drug interactions.

508
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:13,400
P-glycoprotein is located
on the apical side

509
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,040
of plasma membranes
right next to lumens.

510
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:23,520
It is expressed in
intestine, liver,

511
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,700
kidney, brain capillaries,
placenta, other

512
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:28,860
tissues. It is
expressed on tumor

513
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:33,700
cells and confers
multi-drug resistance.

514
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:37,400
And there are certain
efflux transporters

515
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:43,640
on bacteria that pump
our antibiotics out.

516
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,570
A little bit of a review.

517
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:53,160
The practice
questions give more

518
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,580
interesting questions
for application

519
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,740
of the knowledge.
This is just a

520
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:00,020
check your knowledge
review, and I

521
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:02,400
recommend that you
pause the computer,

522
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:06,580
answer them in
your own words from

523
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,820
your own memory,
and then after you

524
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:11,400
try, look it
up, and then try

525
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,680
answering from your
own memory again.

526
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,980
So please pause
if you wish.

527
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:22,820
And coming back now,
what physicochemical

528
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:25,380
property determines the
ability of a drug to

529
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:28,420
passively diffuse
through lipid membranes?

530
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,920
By what mechanism
can a hydrophilic

531
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:34,380
drug cross
physiologic barriers?

532
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:37,540
For drugs that
are weak acids and

533
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,380
weak bases, why
is the pH of a

534
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:41,940
biologic fluid
clinically important?

535
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:45,030
And here are the answers.

536
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:48,040
The lipid water
coefficient of a

537
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,060
drug, which is the
ratio of the drug

538
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,240
in the lipid and
the aqueous phases,

539
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:55,640
determines how
readily the drug

540
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:58,740
molecule moves across
lipid membranes.

541
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:01,100
Lipid-soluble
drugs passively

542
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,620
diffuse through the lipid

543
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:04,680
membranes, which
are not saturable.

544
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,060
The rate of transfer, I'm

545
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,560
always talking
about rates,

546
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,700
across the membranes
from an area

547
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,540
of higher
concentration to lower

548
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:17,640
concentration is
directly proportional

549
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:21,600
to the lipid
water coefficient.

550
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,360
A hydrophilic drug
can cross physiologic

551
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,280
barriers via
transport proteins.

552
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,000
Passive diffusion or
facilitated transport

553
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,960
down the concentration
gradient.

554
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,860
Or energy using
active transport.

555
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:40,360
That would be
secondary and primary.

556
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:44,760
Transporters are
saturable. When all the

557
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:49,680
transporters are occupied,
then nothing else

558
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,470
can get through until
they are unoccupied.

559
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:56,660
They are at their
maximum rate of transfer.

560
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:00,720
Weak acids and weak
bases either gain or

561
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,300
lose electrical charge
-bearing protons, depending

562
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:07,920
on their pKa and the
pH of the medium.

563
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:11,520
only the uncharged
form of the drug will

564
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,080
passively diffuse across
the lipid bilayer while

565
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:18,580
the charged form does
not this is called

566
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:26,500
ion ion trapping
manipulation of urine ph may

567
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,940
be appropriate for
increasing the rate of

568
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:32,000
excretion by ion
trapping of certain drugs

569
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,060
such as toxic concentrations
of salicylates.

570
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,960
Okay, so how do we
introduce the drug

571
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,920
into the body? Looking
at this figure,

572
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:51,800
it's easy to see
that basically by any

573
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:57,340
method, any *******
and injection into

574
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,740
everywhere,

575
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,800
basically.

576
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:04,360
Skin, veins,

577
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,560
arteries,

578
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,440
spine,

579
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,040
ventricles.

580
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:13,640
Selection of the
root is determined by

581
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,560
the properties of the
drug and therapeutic

582
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:19,220
objectives. What
is the goal of

583
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:21,440
therapy? How quickly
does the drug need

584
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:26,900
to be on board in
therapeutic levels.

585
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:32,380
I'm not going to
go through every

586
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:34,600
single route of
administration.

587
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,540
I have a table at
the end of this

588
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:43,340
PowerPoint with the
benefits and disadvantages

589
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:46,200
of all of the
various routes of

590
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:49,320
administration. You
do need to know it.

591
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:58,560
need to know this
is medicine. This is

592
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,960
how you are going
to administer drugs

593
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,160
to your patient. So
this is straightforward,

594
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:08,680
and you can look
through that

595
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:11,820
on your own. You do
need to learn it.

596
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:17,340
This is a quick
overview. enteral roots

597
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:21,460
either so going through
the mouth basically

598
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:25,160
or an enteral tube
or at the other

599
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:29,500
end rectally going into
the gut now sublingual

600
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:32,700
and buckle go into
the mouth this

601
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,860
is tongue under the
tongue this is between

602
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:38,480
the gum and cheek
but they pass through

603
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,620
the mucous membranes
of the mouth into

604
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:45,020
the venous drainage
of the oral cavity.

605
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:49,660
The upper small
intestine, upper

606
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:52,280
small intestine, is
the major site of

607
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:55,160
oral drug absorption
because the

608
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,580
intestine is made for
absorption. That's

609
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:59,960
its job. It's an
absorptive organ.

610
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:03,320
The stomach is
not an absorptive

611
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:06,940
organ. It is a
digestive organ.

612
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:13,020
Parenteral, so drugs
that are injected.

613
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:15,340
I've indicated all the

614
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,900
various routes
of injection.

615
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:21,340
Topical, we think
of topical as

616
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:23,260
application for
local effect.

617
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:28,160
Skin comes to mind
readily, eyes, ears.

618
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,400
Lungs,

619
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,060
people who take
inhalers for

620
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:34,140
lung disease.
we're applying the

621
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,980
drug directly
to lung tissue.

622
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:39,360
Gut, if the drug
is not absorbed and

623
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,900
stays in the gut,
it can actually

624
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:44,060
be used topically
for gut problems.

625
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:48,880
And transdermal, this
is transmucosal here,

626
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:57,360
transdermal is
topical, however it's

627
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,040
intended to pass
through the skin

628
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,160
layers for systemic
circulation.

629
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:09,940
This little figure
shows where the

630
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:13,480
needle is injected
for various

631
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,340
parenteral roots
through the skin.

632
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,340
So that's all I'm
going to say about

633
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:24,800
absorption and
administration, or I

634
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,220
should say routes
of administration,

635
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:29,260
so please do learn
that on your own.

636
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,800
So distribution
is the process by

637
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,600
which a drug
reversibly leaves the

638
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,540
bloodstream
and enters the

639
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:38,660
interstitial and
intracellular fluids.

640
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:43,540
Moving through the
body, two targets.

641
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:48,160
First pass effect,
bioavailability, and

642
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,820
extent of distribution.
The first pass

643
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:57,380
effect is merely how
much of the drug that's

644
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:00,520
taken ****** will
pass through the gut

645
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:04,180
into the portal
circulation, pass through

646
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:09,660
the liver and be
metabolized within the

647
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:13,560
liver. So first pass
effect is basically

648
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:20,600
the inactivation by
drug metabolism and

649
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:24,640
a certain percent will
then be distributed

650
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:28,580
however much manages
to get through

651
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:32,520
that process to the
systemic circulation.

652
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:36,260
So the first pass
effect just to

653
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:39,540
reiterate so you won't
be confused, is about

654
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:44,060
the inactivation by
drug metabolizing.

655
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:47,300
Enzymes of oral
drugs, because they

656
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:50,580
pass through the
liver first before

657
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:52,760
going into the
systemic circulation.

658
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:57,200
Now bioavailability
is the amount

659
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,940
that actually
passes through and

660
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:02,220
gets to the systemic
circulation.

661
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:09,000
so it is the fraction
of the dose of the

662
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,560
active drug that
reaches the systemic

663
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,820
circulation so a drug
that is taken ******

664
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:17,780
and is completely
metabolized through by

665
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:20,660
the liver on the first
pass is not a useful

666
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:24,080
drug because very
little of it will

667
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:28,300
get to the systemic
circulation So, all

668
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:32,520
drugs that are oral
must have some degree

669
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:36,160
of bioavailability in
order to be useful.

670
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:43,000
the rate and extent of
distribution through

671
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,940
the body is determined
by for the i don't

672
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:49,080
know how many times
now 25th time or

673
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:51,660
something the physical
physical chemical

674
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:55,840
properties of the
drug and the patient's

675
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:59,540
physiologic factors is
the patient young and

676
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:02,860
healthy? Does the
patient have adequate

677
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:06,440
cardiac output, adequate
regional blood flow?

678
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:10,760
How is the capillary
permeability? That's

679
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:13,480
how drugs get into
interstitial spaces.

680
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,280
And what is the volume
of this patient,

681
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,460
the tissue volume?
How large are

682
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:23,540
they? How much muscle
mass do they have?

683
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:26,500
How much fat mass
do they have, etc.

684
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,580
Now redistribution,
that's certainly

685
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:33,880
an important concept
in distribution.

686
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,760
We'll talk about
redistribution.

687
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:39,820
This is so boards
relevant. So

688
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:46,660
what is it? What
we're talking

689
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:51,130
about is one dose
of a highly lipid

690
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:52,900
soluble drug. So
what kind of drug

691
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:55,040
is that? Let's
say an anesthetic.

692
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,560
That's when we
talk about it most

693
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,920
frequently. So we're
talking about one

694
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,800
dose of an anesthetic.
We might be

695
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,160
talking about an
anti-seizure drug.

696
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:10,580
So we see on this figure,

697
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:12,560
the peak is right here.

698
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:16,060
So if it's an oral
drug, it's going to

699
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:18,540
be a lag time. But
let's talk about an

700
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:22,180
IV drug. It's administered
IV, gets right

701
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:26,040
away into the
bloodstream, and it will

702
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:30,300
be carried
through the body

703
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:33,880
to the highly
perfused organs.

704
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:37,980
So VRG stands for
vessel-rich group.

705
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:41,700
And what is the
vessel-rich group that

706
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:43,880
we're concerned with
with an anesthetic?

707
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:48,400
The brain, CNS, brain,
and spinal cord.

708
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,300
All right, this
one dose of

709
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:54,440
drug travels to the brain

710
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,800
and because the
brain tissue has no

711
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:00,900
molecules in it at
that moment and the

712
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:03,800
concentration in blood
is high, the drug will

713
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,980
move down its
concentration gradient into

714
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:08,820
the CNS tissues and
produce its effects.

715
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:11,660
And as the drug
does that and

716
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:12,900
moves through
the body, the

717
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:16,180
concentration in
drug now decreases.

718
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:21,100
At the same time, the
vessel-rich group,

719
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:24,100
including the CNS, is
taking up the drug.

720
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:30,880
So the concentration
increases in the vessel

721
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,180
-rich group, decreases
in the bloodstream,

722
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:35,240
there's only a certain
amount that has to go

723
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:39,000
around to everywhere,
produces its effect.

724
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:42,580
And as the
bloodstream, as

725
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:45,180
the drug in
blood is reduced,

726
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,500
you see it's even
going into the

727
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:49,860
skeletal muscles
here, but much

728
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:53,060
more slowly because
they're less

729
00:45:54,510 --> 00:45:57,500
perfused than the
vessel-rich group.

730
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,760
Now the drug is
moving out of the CNS

731
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,240
tissues back into
the blood because the

732
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,660
concentration gradient
in the blood is lower.

733
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:08,000
Okay,

734
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,720
and drug moves to
the other tissues

735
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:14,000
based on the level
or perfusion. So the

736
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,800
point is, with
redistribution, the drug

737
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:21,260
produces its CNS
effect very rapidly.

738
00:46:22,410 --> 00:46:24,560
And with the one dose,

739
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:30,200
as the concentration
in plasma decreases,

740
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:34,060
the CNS effect decreases,

741
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:37,320
decreased CNS effect.

742
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:42,520
This phenomenon
occurs primarily

743
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,360
when one dose
of highly lipid

744
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:46,600
-soluble drug
acting on the brain

745
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:51,320
and spinal cord is
administered rapidly

746
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:54,580
by intravenous injection
or by inhalation.

747
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:56,900
Many anesthetics,
well, a few

748
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:58,760
anesthetics are
by inhalation.

749
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:02,520
The drug rapidly
distributes to the CNS,

750
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:05,680
moves down the
concentration gradient into

751
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,860
the CNS tissues, and
produces its effect.

752
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:13,430
The drug then moves
back into the blood

753
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:15,920
as it is taken up
by the less vascular

754
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:19,400
tissues, which, and
here's the key point,

755
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:22,780
terminates the
CNS effect.

756
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:31,020
But, IV administration
of drug moves to

757
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:36,820
CNS, produces its
effect, then it quickly

758
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:40,200
terminates the CNS
effect as it moves

759
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,220
out of the CNS
tissue back into the

760
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:46,400
bloodstream. Now,
this is not related to

761
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:49,400
the drug moving out
of the body, being

762
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:53,040
excreted by the
body. It's just the

763
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:58,060
redistribution into
the peripheral tissues.

764
00:47:58,060 --> 00:48:00,040
That's the concept.

765
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:04,460
Termination of
CNS effect of

766
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:06,540
this highly lipid
-soluble drug.

767
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,840
One dose by
redistribution

768
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:11,680
to the peripheral
tissues.

769
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:13,200
That's it.

770
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:21,240
Distribution across
the placenta. The fetus

771
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,700
is to some extent
exposed to all drugs,

772
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:26,300
or nearly all drugs,
taken by the mother.

773
00:48:28,090 --> 00:48:30,680
Placental transfer
of drugs across the

774
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:34,200
placenta may cause
anomalies in the developing

775
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:37,380
fetus. So the general
determinants of

776
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:43,700
drugs that can produce
important levels

777
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:47,640
in the fetus's
bloodstream, systemic

778
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:51,340
circulation, are the
lipid solubility of the

779
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:54,580
drug. If it's lipid
-soluble, it can, as

780
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:57,560
you know, can cross
physiologic membranes.

781
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:01,380
If the drug is
highly protein-bound,

782
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:05,920
then there is a
lower amount of free

783
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,820
drug that can
cross the lipid

784
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:11,900
membranes. But it
could still be enough.

785
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:16,480
Fetal plasma is
slightly more acidic

786
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,700
than the mother,
so thinking

787
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:20,920
about ion-trapping
of basic drugs.

788
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:28,800
P-glycoprotein and other
export transporters

789
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:33,340
are part of that blood
placenta barrier.

790
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:37,980
So they function
to limit the fetal

791
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:41,480
exposure of certain
drugs. Drugs that

792
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:44,360
are substrates of
poor P-glycoprotein.

793
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:50,140
Now drug reservoirs.

794
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:53,840
I've mentioned this
a few times by now.

795
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:56,520
Drug reservoirs
and other, think

796
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:59,900
about storage
sites, storage.

797
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:05,520
Reversible binding,
and that's how

798
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:11,660
these are. The
drugs are 99.999999%

799
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:15,600
reversible binding
to the inert plasma

800
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:19,160
proteins and inert
tissue macromolecules

801
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:22,780
tends to sequester
the drug in those

802
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:24,180
compartments. So
what does that mean?

803
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:35,500
Drugs on inert
molecules are not free.

804
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:40,200
They are not free
to be metabolized.

805
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,360
They are not free
to be excreted. They

806
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:45,720
are not free to
travel to their

807
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:49,060
site of action or
anywhere else. They

808
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:52,520
are riding around
on the albumin bus.

809
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:57,400
Albumin is the major
plasma protein that

810
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,820
we're thinking about
when it comes to

811
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:03,720
sequestering of drugs
on plasma proteins.

812
00:51:05,770 --> 00:51:09,480
Drugs that bind to tissue

813
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:12,660
macromolecules stay
in the tissues.

814
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:15,240
Now this is
reversible, don't

815
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:17,040
forget, reversible
binding.

816
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,680
So the drugs can be on

817
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:23,500
and off and on and off.

818
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:28,940
And the extent
depends on their

819
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:31,320
affinity for those
plasma proteins

820
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:33,820
and the concentration
of drug.

821
00:51:38,650 --> 00:51:41,510
Looking at our plasma
protein concept here,

822
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:45,130
we have our drug protein

823
00:51:45,130 --> 00:51:47,390
complex and free drug.

824
00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:50,150
This is in dynamic

825
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:54,050
equilibrium at
steady state.

826
00:51:54,130 --> 00:51:59,230
So steady state
occurs with continuous

827
00:51:59,230 --> 00:52:03,110
dosing. Either it's an
IV dose that's going

828
00:52:03,110 --> 00:52:06,750
in by continuous
infusion or it's dosed

829
00:52:06,750 --> 00:52:09,990
by any route of
administration that goes in

830
00:52:09,990 --> 00:52:15,530
at a frequency, at
a regular frequency.

831
00:52:15,570 --> 00:52:17,830
So that's what we
mean by continuous

832
00:52:17,830 --> 00:52:19,770
dosing. And it
gets to the point

833
00:52:19,770 --> 00:52:23,650
where there is
dynamic equilibrium.

834
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:28,630
Here's our free
drug molecules in

835
00:52:28,630 --> 00:52:31,170
plasma in this figure,
and you can see

836
00:52:31,170 --> 00:52:34,530
they pass through the
spaces and capillaries

837
00:52:34,530 --> 00:52:36,370
and they move
into the tissues.

838
00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:39,390
The bound drug does not.

839
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:45,310
That's the basic idea.

840
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,590
We'll talk more about

841
00:52:47,590 --> 00:52:49,150
that in a future lecture.

842
00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:52,970
Oh, sorry.

843
00:52:54,330 --> 00:52:55,410
Okay.

844
00:52:57,430 --> 00:53:00,190
Okay, so some of
the features of drug

845
00:53:00,190 --> 00:53:02,470
binding to these inert
molecules, meaning

846
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:05,430
they don't have a
regulatory effect,

847
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:08,030
they're important,
but they don't cause,

848
00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:10,890
when they're, they
don't have, they're

849
00:53:10,890 --> 00:53:12,870
not activated and
producing some

850
00:53:12,870 --> 00:53:18,490
biologic effect as on
molecules, on cells.

851
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:24,210
drug binding is non
-selective so that

852
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:28,770
means a wide variety
of different chemical

853
00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:33,470
structures can
be bound to the

854
00:53:33,470 --> 00:53:38,100
plasma protein it's
variable saturable

855
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:41,030
there are only just
so many molecules of

856
00:53:41,030 --> 00:53:44,350
albumin floating
around in the blood it

857
00:53:44,350 --> 00:53:46,930
is non-linear meaning
it's saturable

858
00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:50,470
and it is reversible.

859
00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:56,650
So on and off
and on and off

860
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,530
in a dynamic equilibrium.

861
00:53:58,930 --> 00:54:03,150
The fraction bound is
determined by how much

862
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:05,830
drug there is. So the
drug concentration.

863
00:54:08,110 --> 00:54:12,290
What is the affinity
of that plasma protein

864
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:14,070
for the drug? If
it has no affinity,

865
00:54:14,070 --> 00:54:16,350
it won't bind the
drug. or it might have

866
00:54:16,350 --> 00:54:18,470
high affinity and
bind the drug tightly,

867
00:54:18,470 --> 00:54:20,610
but it's usually
somewhere in the middle.

868
00:54:21,770 --> 00:54:26,370
And albumin has a
number of binding sites.

869
00:54:27,090 --> 00:54:28,950
It could be
binding a number of

870
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:31,230
different molecules
at the same time.

871
00:54:31,370 --> 00:54:34,410
So if there are
a large number,

872
00:54:34,410 --> 00:54:37,370
then it's got a big
capacity to bind

873
00:54:37,370 --> 00:54:38,810
drugs. If there's
a small number

874
00:54:38,810 --> 00:54:41,370
available, then a
smaller capacity.

875
00:54:43,790 --> 00:54:46,590
Competition and
disease related factors

876
00:54:46,590 --> 00:54:49,510
can determine the
extent of drug binding.

877
00:54:53,550 --> 00:54:56,310
So here's a check
your knowledge

878
00:54:56,310 --> 00:54:59,770
and perhaps you
would like to

879
00:55:01,030 --> 00:55:03,610
pause the video
and try and answer

880
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:06,470
these on your own.
So you may pause now.

881
00:55:08,050 --> 00:55:10,410
and welcome back. I hope

882
00:55:10,410 --> 00:55:12,270
you gave this
some thought.

883
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:14,570
Oral drugs are
absorbed mainly

884
00:55:14,570 --> 00:55:16,430
from what part
of the intestine?

885
00:55:17,110 --> 00:55:19,810
What is the clinical
significance of the

886
00:55:19,810 --> 00:55:22,590
phenomenon of redistribution
when applied to

887
00:55:22,590 --> 00:55:25,390
highly lipophilic drugs
such as anesthetics?

888
00:55:25,570 --> 00:55:28,170
What is the concern
about drugs that

889
00:55:28,170 --> 00:55:30,250
can cross the blood
placenta barrier?

890
00:55:30,570 --> 00:55:32,750
And what is the
clinical relevance

891
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:34,150
of drug binding to plasma

892
00:55:34,150 --> 00:55:36,570
proteins and tissue
macromolecules.

893
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,810
Drugs are absorbed
mainly from the

894
00:55:41,810 --> 00:55:44,030
upper small intestine,
which has a very

895
00:55:44,030 --> 00:55:46,210
large surface
area for absorbing

896
00:55:46,210 --> 00:55:50,070
nutrients and drugs,
because of villi along

897
00:55:50,070 --> 00:55:52,210
the length of the
small intestine.

898
00:55:53,810 --> 00:55:58,790
The redistribution
refers to a drug that

899
00:55:58,790 --> 00:56:02,570
will go immediately
to the CNS, produce

900
00:56:02,570 --> 00:56:06,310
the CNS effect,
and as the drug is

901
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:10,250
redistributed to the
peripheral tissue,

902
00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:14,550
the plasma concentration
of the drug is

903
00:56:14,550 --> 00:56:18,770
reduced and the CNS
effect is diminished.

904
00:56:20,950 --> 00:56:24,290
Drugs able to cross the
blood placenta barrier

905
00:56:24,290 --> 00:56:28,130
can lead to fetal
exposure of the drug.

906
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:31,650
Practitioners need to
know what drugs are

907
00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:36,370
safe, what drugs are
toxic to the fetus, and

908
00:56:36,370 --> 00:56:41,190
at which stages of the
pregnancy. This is a

909
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:45,990
must-know that we will
talk about as we go

910
00:56:45,990 --> 00:56:50,130
through these various
drug classes later on.

911
00:56:51,410 --> 00:56:53,350
Plasma proteins
and tissue

912
00:56:53,350 --> 00:56:55,610
macromolecules
are inert. They do

913
00:56:55,610 --> 00:56:57,650
not regulate
cellular actions.

914
00:56:57,830 --> 00:57:02,310
Drugs reversibly bound
to plasma proteins

915
00:57:02,310 --> 00:57:04,750
or tissue macromolecules
are sequestered.

916
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:07,750
They're not free
to be metabolized,

917
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:09,750
excreted, or reach
the site of action.

918
00:57:09,890 --> 00:57:13,250
As the concentration
of free drug decreases

919
00:57:13,250 --> 00:57:15,790
due to elimination,
drug molecules

920
00:57:15,790 --> 00:57:18,770
dissociate, which
maintains the free drug

921
00:57:18,770 --> 00:57:22,250
concentration at a
constant fraction.

922
00:57:25,890 --> 00:57:31,610
And in summary, this
is a little mind

923
00:57:31,610 --> 00:57:35,810
map of the
pharmacokinetic processes.

924
00:57:37,410 --> 00:57:40,490
The physicochemical
characteristics of

925
00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:42,890
a drug determine its
ability to withstand

926
00:57:42,890 --> 00:57:45,390
digestive fluids
and enzymes and be

927
00:57:45,390 --> 00:57:48,250
absorbed from the
GI tract, cross

928
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:51,230
physiologic barriers,
survive metabolic

929
00:57:51,230 --> 00:57:54,030
processes. distribute
to the site of action

930
00:57:54,030 --> 00:57:57,110
in therapeutic
concentrations and exit

931
00:57:57,110 --> 00:58:00,130
the site of action
and be eliminated.

932
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:02,790
Drugs move along
their concentration

933
00:58:02,790 --> 00:58:05,210
gradients by passive
diffusion across the

934
00:58:05,210 --> 00:58:08,090
lipid bilayer of
cell membranes or by

935
00:58:08,090 --> 00:58:11,730
carrier or channel
-mediated transport.

936
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:14,890
Drugs may also be
pumped out by energy

937
00:58:14,890 --> 00:58:18,770
-dependent active
transport. very large

938
00:58:18,770 --> 00:58:22,710
or lipid-insoluble
drugs may enter or exit

939
00:58:22,710 --> 00:58:25,990
cells by endocytosis
or pinocytosis,

940
00:58:25,990 --> 00:58:29,090
which I didn't actually
mention before.

941
00:58:29,410 --> 00:58:32,750
This applies to
so few drugs.

942
00:58:34,490 --> 00:58:37,890
The rate and extent of
flow of drug molecules

943
00:58:37,890 --> 00:58:41,180
are influenced by
the magnitude of a

944
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:46,500
concentration gradient
across the membrane, lipid

945
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:49,950
solubility, that is
to say lipid water

946
00:58:49,950 --> 00:58:52,830
partition coefficient,
membrane surface area,

947
00:58:52,830 --> 00:58:56,210
thickness, and
permeability. Weak acids and

948
00:58:56,210 --> 00:58:58,490
weak bases are present
in solution as both a

949
00:58:58,490 --> 00:59:01,610
non-ionized and ionized
species. The non

950
00:59:01,610 --> 00:59:04,810
-ionized molecules usually
are more lipid soluble

951
00:59:04,810 --> 00:59:06,850
and can diffuse
readily across the cell

952
00:59:06,850 --> 00:59:10,050
membrane, whereas the
ionized molecules usually

953
00:59:10,050 --> 00:59:12,350
are less able to
********* the lipid

954
00:59:12,350 --> 00:59:15,650
membrane because of their
low lipid solubility.

955
00:59:16,230 --> 00:59:18,270
Transmembrane
distribution is

956
00:59:18,270 --> 00:59:21,710
determined by the
drugs pKa and the

957
00:59:21,710 --> 00:59:25,090
pH gradient across
the membrane.

958
00:59:26,710 --> 00:59:28,670
Different routes
of administration

959
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:30,690
are used in clinical
medicine for

960
00:59:30,690 --> 00:59:33,410
various reasons,
such as convenience,

961
00:59:33,410 --> 00:59:35,930
rapid onset of
action, maximizing

962
00:59:35,930 --> 00:59:38,090
concentration at
the site of action,

963
00:59:38,350 --> 00:59:40,310
avoiding first
-pass effect,

964
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:43,090
and minimizing
adverse effects.

965
00:59:43,150 --> 00:59:45,890
The rate and extent
of drug distribution

966
00:59:45,890 --> 00:59:47,910
are determined by
the physico-chemical

967
00:59:47,910 --> 00:59:51,870
properties of the drug and
the physiologic factors

968
00:59:51,870 --> 00:59:55,550
of cardiac output,
regional blood flow,

969
00:59:55,670 --> 00:59:58,990
capillary permeability,
and tissue volume.

970
00:59:59,430 --> 01:00:02,050
Extensive binding to
inert proteins and

971
01:00:02,050 --> 01:00:05,050
other macromolecules
may slow the rate at

972
01:00:05,050 --> 01:00:07,090
which a drug reaches
the site of action

973
01:00:07,090 --> 01:00:10,670
and may prolong the
duration of action as

974
01:00:10,670 --> 01:00:14,230
the drugs are sequestered
in the tissues.

975
01:00:16,870 --> 01:00:19,970
These are the tables
I mentioned before.

976
01:00:20,510 --> 01:00:24,230
It tells you the
root, the absorption

977
01:00:24,230 --> 01:00:26,290
pattern, what
they're useful

978
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:30,990
for, and potential
disadvantages.

979
01:00:32,850 --> 01:00:35,990
There are lots of
roots. Most of this is

980
01:00:35,990 --> 01:00:38,450
intuitive. you probably
know it already,

981
01:00:40,180 --> 01:00:43,430
but you do need to know
it. As a physician,

982
01:00:43,430 --> 01:00:47,900
it's so so important
to be able to

983
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:50,040
select the right route
of administration.

984
01:00:51,670 --> 01:00:56,050
And that concludes
part one of our

985
01:00:56,050 --> 01:01:00,470
pharmacokinetics
ADME, administration,

986
01:01:00,470 --> 01:01:03,230
distribution, metabolism,
and excretion.

1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:01,790
Welcome, students, to

2
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:04,250
Pharmacokinetics Part 2,

3
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:08,130
Principles of Metabolism
and Excretion.

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,090
And we will also talk
about the individual

5
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:13,690
variation in
response to drugs. We

6
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:16,290
talk about the big
picture, and then

7
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:19,270
we'll drill down to
what happens that can

8
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:21,890
cause changes in
our expectation to

9
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:24,410
drug response in the
individual patient.

10
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:27,390
Dr. Goldstein speaking.

11
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:31,870
please contact me if
you'd like to have a

12
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:35,270
chat about pharmacology
individuals and

13
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:39,610
groups are welcome
here are the learning

14
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:44,330
objectives mechanisms
mechanisms mechanisms

15
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:48,570
and these is all
about bio elimination

16
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:53,450
elimination by
biotransformation in other words

17
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:57,530
metabolism and
elimination by excretion.

18
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:02,370
My suggestions,

19
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,390
and please do
the practice

20
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,150
questions, they
will help you.

21
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,880
Here are some links
you might find

22
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,990
helpful if you
wish to use them.

23
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:18,290
I talked about the
key elements of

24
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:20,890
metabolism and
excretion in In

25
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:25,690
part one, this is
what we'll cover.

26
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:30,230
And let us begin
with the general

27
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:32,150
principles of
drug metabolism.

28
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:36,570
These are enzyme
-catalyzed conversion

29
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:41,910
of our drug, a
chemical, to some other

30
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:45,170
molecule, some other
chemical. We have

31
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:47,270
many, many protein
drugs that have been

32
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:50,090
developed in the
past 20 or 25 years.

33
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:54,650
Protein drugs are
subject to metabolism as

34
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,950
other proteins are,
proteolytic cleavage.

35
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:02,110
We need to also be
thinking about the

36
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:05,410
individual patient in
terms of pharmacogenomics.

37
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:10,310
People do have
variabilities in the

38
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:14,770
expression of their
various metabolic enzymes.

39
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:19,290
We'll talk about phase
1 and phase 2 reactions.

40
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:22,790
The genetic factors,
as I said, and we'll

41
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:25,250
also talk about
inhibition and induction,

42
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:35,630
which are mechanisms
of drug interactions.

43
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:40,630
Super important
concept. We'll go

44
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:43,350
into that more in
later lectures.

45
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:48,830
the liver is the
principal organ of drug

46
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:52,110
metabolism drug
metabolism concurrent can

47
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,550
occur in many tissues
but the liver is

48
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:59,550
actually built to do
that it has a large

49
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:02,950
blood flow it has a portal
circulation directly

50
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:06,190
from the intestines
to the liver it

51
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:11,590
has open spaces
sinusoidal fenestrations,

52
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:14,590
they're called, allowing
the blood to bring

53
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,630
all sorts of substances
into the liver,

54
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:21,310
high concentration
of metabolic enzymes,

55
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:24,210
high concentration
of transporters,

56
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:27,330
both the solute
carrier type and the

57
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:31,330
primary active that
use ATP for energy.

58
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:36,770
Solute carriers
are located in the

59
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:40,310
basolateral membrane
where they can allow

60
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:45,050
substrates to go
into the hepatocytes.

61
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:48,990
and ABC transporters,
our ATP type, are

62
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:52,270
located in the bile
canalicular system

63
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:58,210
in order to expulse
or efflux drugs

64
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:02,310
into the biliary
system for excretion.

65
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:08,070
This is just a quick
scheme. I will keep

66
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:10,610
talking about the
portal system.

67
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:16,130
Looking on the left
-hand side, the spleen,

68
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,470
stomach, pancreas,
small intestine,

69
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:22,790
colon, the whole
intestine drains into the

70
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:25,750
portal vein, which
goes to the liver.

71
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:31,650
The liver then goes
via the vena cava into

72
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:34,950
the heart, the right
atrium, and gets

73
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:39,150
cycled through the
heart, and the left

74
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:44,030
ventricle pushes blood
into the aorta, which

75
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:48,330
then leads to delivering
blood through the

76
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,630
arterial system to
all parts of the body.

77
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:58,850
This figure
shows the liver

78
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:01,410
and the gallbladder
underneath.

79
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:06,430
gallbladder squeezes
out the bile acids

80
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:11,210
when a person eats a
fatty meal bile acids

81
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:14,370
go into the duodenum
to emulsify that

82
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:17,970
fat for digestion and
it travels through

83
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:20,650
this is representing
the entire small

84
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:24,390
intestine to the
terminal ileum where the

85
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:28,030
bile acids the large
majority of bile acids

86
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,970
are then reabsorbed
back into the portal

87
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:33,970
vein, back into the
liver, where they

88
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:38,430
get recycled back
into the gallbladder.

89
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:40,850
Very efficient system.

90
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:46,530
If a drug enters the
gallbladder through

91
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:50,390
the bile canalicular
system, that

92
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:54,470
also will go back
into the intestine.

93
00:05:55,870 --> 00:06:00,710
and if it's a certain
metabolic product

94
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:04,270
like a glucuronide
then that may

95
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:09,690
actually be reactivated
which I'll go into

96
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:12,330
back into the portal
vein but otherwise

97
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:15,070
it just gets
excreted in the feces

98
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:21,710
and this is a picture
an illustration of

99
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:25,210
the liver lobule to
kind of give you the

100
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:28,850
landmarks to to be able
to visualize what's

101
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:33,270
going on in the liver
that you don't have to

102
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:36,290
memorize that I just
wanted to explain the

103
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:39,710
portal system and how
important that is when

104
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:42,150
we're talking about
drugs especially oral

105
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:46,910
drugs drugs may be
biotransformed to inactive

106
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:50,030
active or toxic
metabolites or more

107
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:54,230
hydrophilic readily
excretable products drugs

108
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:56,570
can also pass through
the liver unchanged

109
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:04,790
what happens is for
effective drugs that

110
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:09,010
pass through the liver
a certain fraction

111
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:13,550
of them will be
secreted unchanged

112
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:16,590
into the systemic
circulation and therefore

113
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:19,150
be available to
produce their effect.

114
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:26,290
Drug enters hepatocyte
through transporter,

115
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:29,850
solute carrier
transporter.

116
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:33,170
Drug has a number
of different

117
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:35,650
metabolic pathways
it can go into.

118
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:40,730
Phase one to a metabolite,
that metabolite

119
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:45,510
may be secreted into
the bile canaliculus

120
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:51,950
or it may just be
forming a metabolite

121
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:54,350
or two metabolites
or a variety of

122
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:59,790
metabolites and be secreted
into the bloodstream,

123
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:02,930
into the systemic
circulation. These

124
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:05,290
are most frequently
inactive, so they

125
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:07,650
would be excreted,
usually in the kidney.

126
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:10,430
These are excreted in
the feces, anything

127
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,460
that goes through
the bile canaliculi.

128
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:18,350
The drug may also go
straight to phase 2

129
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:22,250
and be secreted as
a metabolite, an

130
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:28,120
inactive metabolite
usually, vastly more

131
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,850
frequently as an an
active metabolite than

132
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:33,490
something that has
some sort of activity.

133
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:38,590
Or that metabolite
may be secreted into

134
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:42,420
the bile canaliculus.
And this is most

135
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:48,310
frequently the glucuronide
metabolite that

136
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:53,590
gets secreted into
the bile canaliculi.

137
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:57,510
Not exclusively,
but most frequently.

138
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:05,310
The drug can
be excreted as

139
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:08,270
is into the
bile canaliculi.

140
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:10,970
The drug can be excreted

141
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:14,670
as is into the
bloodstream.

142
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:17,830
So we have all of these
different options.

143
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,170
The vast majority of
drugs, though, will

144
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:25,250
undergo some level
of metabolism in the

145
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,910
liver. And if these
are oral drugs, they

146
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:31,550
will undergo on the
first pass through.

147
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:37,390
So let's talk about
first pass metabolism.

148
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:39,970
This is also called
first pass effect.

149
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:46,970
Drug gets swallowed,
goes to stomach,

150
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:50,230
goes to small
intestine where it is

151
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:56,030
absorbed. and it
enters the portal

152
00:09:56,030 --> 00:10:01,040
circulation ah but there
are metabolic enzymes

153
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,470
in the epithelial
cells of the gut

154
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:08,770
and the drug may be
metabolized also in

155
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:12,290
the gut not all
drugs but some drugs

156
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:17,370
the drug gets to the
liver and it undergoes

157
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:20,450
metabolism to some
degree which i will

158
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:23,340
talk about more in
a future lecture so

159
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,470
because this is oral
administration and

160
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,270
goes to the liver
first it's called first

161
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:32,670
pass effect or first
pass metabolism or

162
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:35,510
first pass hepatic
metabolism all of those

163
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:39,150
are the same meaning,
the same process.

164
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:45,170
Any drug that actually
leaves the liver as

165
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:50,030
active drug into the
systemic circulation will

166
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:55,470
then produce its
effect and the fraction

167
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:59,990
that enters the systemic
circulation is called

168
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:03,610
the bioavailability
of the drug it is

169
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:08,290
available biologically
to produce its biological

170
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:12,900
effect so first pass
metabolism first pass

171
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:17,270
effect so let's talk
about phase one metabolic

172
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:19,870
reactions these are
oxidation reduction

173
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:27,970
and hydrolysis what happens
here is a functional

174
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:31,490
group is exposed
something like this

175
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:37,090
these are pretty typical
and that will most

176
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:41,050
frequently it caused
inactivation of the drug

177
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:46,670
molecule which may then
be secreted and into

178
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:49,270
the systemic circulation
and excreted or

179
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:52,970
secreted into the biliary
system and excreted.

180
00:11:55,870 --> 00:12:00,290
Sometimes an active
metabolite is formed.

181
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:03,310
That active metabolite
goes into the systemic

182
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:06,070
circulation and
produces an effect and

183
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:10,270
is eventually
inactivated through

184
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:12,270
other metabolic
processes.

185
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:15,250
Toxic metabolites
can form.

186
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:22,590
Sometimes the product
will undergo phase two

187
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:25,890
because it's not
soluble enough to be

188
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:30,490
excreted as a hydrophilic
compound in the kidney.

189
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:32,900
So we have all these
different options.

190
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:39,050
The cytochrome P450
mixed function oxidase

191
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:46,770
system are really
the most frequent

192
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:49,870
phase one metabolic
reactions. It's

193
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:52,590
this big super family
it's called and

194
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:55,510
they're referred to as
CYPs. I refer to them

195
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:58,370
as CYPs. Many people
call them CYPs.

196
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:04,450
They are abundant in
the liver. They're

197
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:08,390
present in many other
tissues. They are located

198
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:11,910
on the lipophilic
membranes of the smooth

199
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,990
endoplasmic reticulum.
So they're kind of

200
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:18,050
hanging out right
there on the membranes.

201
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:21,610
And when a substrate
passes by and binds to

202
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:26,470
it, it will then
metabolize that molecule.

203
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:29,710
They have low
substrate specificity.

204
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:33,150
That means that
they're capable

205
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:36,590
of metabolizing
many, many, many,

206
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:39,070
many different
types of substrates.

207
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:45,230
And that's not all they
do, not just drugs.

208
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:48,070
They're also involved
in the metabolism

209
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:52,370
of steroids and fatty
acids and many other

210
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:55,430
products in our body,
natural products.

211
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,530
Heme is required.

212
00:13:57,530 --> 00:14:03,070
Heme has iron in
it, and iron is

213
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:06,390
essential for the
action of the CYPs.

214
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:09,290
I'll explain that
on the next slide.

215
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:13,850
They are susceptible
to inhibition and

216
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:16,430
induction. In
other words, if a

217
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:20,770
substrate is present
on the active site of

218
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:28,110
the CYP and another
drug comes along,

219
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:32,430
the second drug
will not be able

220
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:34,590
to access the
active site and will

221
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:37,870
therefore pass
by unmetabolized.

222
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:41,550
When there is significant

223
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:46,490
inhibition of CYPs,
there can be an increase

224
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:49,310
in the bioavailability,
an increase in the

225
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:51,890
amount of drug that
actually reaches the

226
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:55,130
systemic circulation.
So there is a higher

227
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:58,530
concentration of drug in
the systemic circulation.

228
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:01,150
And remember, the
amount of drug in the

229
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:04,310
systemic circulation
determines the amount

230
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:08,530
of drug at the site of
action, which in turn

231
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:13,530
determines the magnitude
of the effect. So

232
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:17,470
this is a drug interaction
that could lead to

233
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:21,510
increased effect
toxicity adverse effects.

234
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:25,970
Induction, on the other
hand, is an increase

235
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:30,590
in the number of
enzymes available. As

236
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:34,530
a result, the rate
of drug metabolism

237
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:38,390
increases, which can
lower the amount of drug

238
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,630
that reaches the
systemic circulation.

239
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:45,930
And we also have
pharmacogenetic

240
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:51,590
mutations in drug
metabolism. That's

241
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:54,390
really what this
is all about.

242
00:15:55,330 --> 00:16:02,170
Where the enzyme
is changed somehow

243
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,390
compared to the
majority of the

244
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:07,550
population. Perhaps it
is under-functioning.

245
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:10,310
Perhaps it is
over-functioning.

246
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:17,050
The mechanism of
CYPs, as I said,

247
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:20,350
they're embedded
in the membrane

248
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,710
of the endoplasmic
reticulum.

249
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:31,030
And here's a blow up
of that they have this

250
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:35,770
heme inside and it
is the heme that's

251
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:40,270
essential for this
oxidative reaction here's

252
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:43,570
our substrate it's
going to bump into our

253
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:49,410
drug metabolizing enzyme
and be metabolized

254
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:54,290
and here's the process
a A reducing agent

255
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:58,250
is required, and here
we have our reductase.

256
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:01,670
We also need oxygen,

257
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,170
and of course the drug.

258
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:08,370
So the drug plus
the reducing agent

259
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:11,030
will, well, let
me start here.

260
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,210
Here's drug.

261
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:17,110
Step number one. It goes
through the process,

262
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:27,090
picks up an electron,
picks up oxygen,

263
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:35,810
and becomes oxidized.
you do not have to

264
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:40,590
memorize this whole cycle
this is the part you

265
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:45,150
need to remember the
drug the oxygen the

266
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:49,330
reducing agent produces
the metabolite let's

267
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,110
check your knowledge

268
00:17:56,870 --> 00:18:01,370
i invite you to pause
the video see if

269
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:02,930
you can answer these
questions without

270
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:05,490
looking them up and
then go ahead and look

271
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,270
them up and try and
answer them again

272
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:13,410
okay let's look at the
answer CYP metabolism

273
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:20,730
requires what three
elements heme the

274
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:27,150
reducing agent NADPH and
oxygen CYP 450 enzymes

275
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:31,090
are called mono
oxygenases adds an oxygen

276
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,670
CYPs are susceptible
to alteration in

277
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:38,390
rates of drug
elimination, rates, rates,

278
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:41,230
everything in pharmacokinetics
is about rates,

279
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:42,750
by what?

280
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:48,090
Inhibition or
induction of CYPs

281
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:51,190
and by pharmacogenetic or

282
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:54,090
pharmacogenomics
variabilities.

283
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:56,610
How do these alterations

284
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:58,810
potentially affect
patient care?

285
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,230
Alterations in plasma
drug concentrations

286
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:05,450
can lead to increased
potential for

287
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:09,010
toxicity by inhibition
or an under-functioning

288
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:13,470
enzyme, or reduced
efficacy by induction

289
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:17,510
or an ultra-rapidly
functioning enzyme.

290
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:21,870
How is a knowledge of
clinically relevant

291
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:24,350
pharmacokinetic
properties of drugs

292
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:28,130
essential for
patient care. This is

293
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:31,090
why we're learning
about all of this.

294
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:35,810
Mechanisms of drug
interactions and effects

295
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:39,550
of organ function on
plasma drug levels.

296
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:43,150
Because it is
the drug levels

297
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:48,310
that determine the
levels at the site of

298
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:51,670
action that determines
the magnitude of effect.

299
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:54,970
Efficacy and the
potential for adverse

300
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:58,770
effects. The right
drug and the right dose

301
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:03,330
for the right duration
for optimal outcomes.

302
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:09,650
Please make this part

303
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:11,770
of your second nature.

304
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:18,570
all right phase two
metabolic reactions

305
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:21,850
now these transfer
hydrophilic group

306
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:24,430
to the substrate
increasing its polarity

307
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:26,550
and the products
are really almost

308
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:31,030
always 99.9 percent
of the time inactive.

309
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:37,770
These are conjugation
reactions. They

310
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:42,410
transfer a molecule, a
hydrophilic molecule,

311
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:49,330
from a cofactor and
place it on the drug

312
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:52,350
or metabolite. So
they're transferring.

313
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:56,370
The enzymes, therefore,
are transferases.

314
00:20:56,370 --> 00:21:00,120
This example is UDP

315
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,830
-glucuronaciltransferase
or glucuronal

316
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,890
transferase. Both
terms are correct.

317
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:11,930
Which is the major
transferase in the Phase

318
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:17,410
II armamentarium of
metabolic reactions.

319
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,130
UGT1A1 is a
pretty common one.

320
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:22,190
This is how
they are called.

321
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:26,670
UDP,
glucuronaciltransferase,

322
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:29,590
UGT for short.

323
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,370
And that's all there
is to it. It takes

324
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:39,130
molecule from a
donor and attaches

325
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:43,270
it to the drug
molecule or metabolite.

326
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:44,030
That's it.

327
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:46,910
Hydrophilic, excretion,

328
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:48,670
usually through
the kidney.

329
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:59,130
These are the six
different transferases.

330
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:02,650
So UGT I mentioned
was the major one.

331
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:07,340
It gets its glucuronic
acid from UDP,

332
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:12,150
uridine diphosphate,
glucuronic acid.

333
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:14,330
You do not need
to memorize

334
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:16,720
the names of
the cofactors.

335
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:23,290
get the idea that they
are bringing along

336
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:26,960
the hydrophilic molecule
to be transferred

337
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,110
to the drug or
metabolite. You do

338
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:33,870
need to know the name
of the transferases.

339
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:38,510
So we have UGT,
UDP-glucuronacil

340
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:41,070
transferase, or glucuronal
transferase, both

341
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:46,580
are correct. A
sulfotransferase, transferring

342
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:49,150
a sulfate. You
do need to know

343
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:51,750
what gets transferred,
not the cofactor.

344
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,930
And acetyltransferase,
we will be

345
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:56,390
talking about
this plenty of

346
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:59,450
times because of
pharmacogenetics.

347
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:01,630
So acetyl, naturally.

348
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:04,770
Methyltransferase,
transfers methyl.

349
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:08,770
Glutathione.

350
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:12,490
super important in
our bodies because

351
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:15,850
this catalyzes the
nucleophilic attack of

352
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:18,830
glutathione on
electrophilic atoms and

353
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:21,330
xenobiotics and toxic
metabolites so what's

354
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:24,570
all of that all of
that that were all

355
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:27,210
those words what is
the take-home message

356
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:33,410
it detoxifies reactive
oxygen species.

357
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:38,370
And when we run
out of glutathione

358
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:40,870
S transferase
because of starvation

359
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:45,270
or serious, serious
illness, then

360
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:48,270
these toxic metabolites
can hurt us.

361
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:50,810
Glycine is a
little amino acid.

362
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:54,350
It's seen
occasionally. It's not

363
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,110
really one of the
major pathways.

364
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,790
Anyway, these are
all hydrophilic

365
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:01,610
metabolites that
result and they

366
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:04,030
can be readily
excreted in urine.

367
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:09,450
Now let's talk about
enterohepatic circulation

368
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:13,130
and we'll talk about
them as glucuronide

369
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:16,070
metabolites which is
the vast majority.

370
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:23,410
Here on the left
is a picture of the

371
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:27,570
arrangement of the
organs and the liver.

372
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:32,390
Stomach, so food
goes in here.

373
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:35,690
Small intestine,

374
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:39,570
large intestine.

375
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:47,550
Here is the portal
circulation draining

376
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:55,230
all of these organs
and the veins,

377
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:59,570
the venous circulation
in the liver.

378
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,700
Okay, so that's how
it's set up. So what

379
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:07,190
we're going to be talking
about with enteroepatic

380
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:11,190
circulation is as
the drug travels from

381
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,330
the gallbladder, which
is in here underneath

382
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:17,950
the liver, into the
duodenum and travels

383
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:20,310
through the small
intestine, and it gets down

384
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:28,990
here, it will then be
reabsorbed into the

385
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:31,130
portal circulation and
go back to the liver.

386
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,430
okay so what's
happening drug

387
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:36,190
gets swallowed drug gets

388
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:37,770
absorbed from the
small intestine

389
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:41,170
goes to the liver
via the portal system

390
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:46,390
gets a glucuronide stuck
on it that glucuronide

391
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:50,410
metabolite goes into
the biliary system

392
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:52,310
and gets stored in
the gallbladder along

393
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:55,610
with bile acids
Now, somebody eats a

394
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:59,950
fatty meal, and the
glucuronide metabolite is

395
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:03,050
excreted along with
the bile acids and

396
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:07,470
transported in this
really very simple figure

397
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:12,290
here, down here to
the terminal ileum.

398
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:20,110
So that glucuronide
group is cleaved

399
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:23,830
off by intestinal
bacteria

400
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:28,930
flora, which are
populating this area

401
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:30,830
and the whole
large intestine.

402
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:37,190
When that glucuronide
gets cleaved off, we

403
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:40,290
now have active
drug again, and it's

404
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:44,190
lipophilic. So by passive
diffusion, it goes back

405
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:46,610
into the portal
system and back to the

406
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:51,670
liver where it may
be undergo this same

407
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:55,270
situation again. But we
need to remember it's

408
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:58,520
not 100% of the drug
that gets metabolized.

409
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:01,310
I don't know what
percentage it

410
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:03,050
is, so I'll make
up a percentage.

411
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:06,810
Let's say 50% of the
original drug got

412
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:09,150
metabolized and goes
into the gallbladder

413
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:10,850
and blah, blah,
blah and around the

414
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:16,570
circle. So, now, what's
coming back in will

415
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:20,750
get metabolized about
50% of that, and

416
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:24,150
all of this goes
into the bloodstream.

417
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:27,070
The other 50%
goes into the

418
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:29,450
bloodstream as
active drug.

419
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:33,310
Therefore, with
enterohepatic

420
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:39,450
circulation, that
can contribute to the

421
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:42,290
levels in the
systemic circulation.

422
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:44,850
So that's the
takeaway message with

423
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:48,010
enterohepatic
circulation of drugs.

424
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:54,850
well i keep talking
about all these various

425
00:27:54,850 --> 00:28:00,430
enzymes so what
role do they play in

426
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:04,470
metabolism each individual
one on this figure we

427
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:11,770
see the cyp3a4 and 5s
the cyp3a family is

428
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:17,890
about 50% of the CYP
oxidative metabolism.

429
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:21,970
Different sources have
different fractions,

430
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:26,410
but the point is they
all agree that the

431
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:32,490
majority of CYP activity
is by CYP3A family.

432
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:38,070
CYP2D6 plays a pretty
decent portion.

433
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:41,040
We'll talk about that
with pharmacogenomics

434
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,210
at a later
time, and we see

435
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:45,190
little slices from
all these others.

436
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:51,190
UGT here also
is the majority

437
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:53,910
of the transferase
activity.

438
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:57,220
Sulfates has a
pretty good size,

439
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:59,030
glutathione,

440
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:03,910
N-acetyltransferase,
and all the rest.

441
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:07,750
You don't have to
memorize this, just take

442
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:14,690
away the points that
CYP3A family and UDP

443
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:18,150
glucuronal transferase
are very, very

444
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:20,630
important pathways. But
so are the others, they

445
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:23,370
just don't handle
quite as much traffic.

446
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:27,250
All right, check
your knowledge.

447
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:33,570
I, again, invite you
to pause the computer,

448
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:35,710
take a look at
these questions, see

449
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:37,600
if you can answer
them without looking.

450
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:42,750
Okay, let us return now.

451
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:45,750
How do phase 2 reactions

452
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:50,930
differ from phase
1 reactions?

453
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:53,190
Think of three ways.

454
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:56,650
Phase I reactions
are oxidation.

455
00:29:57,410 --> 00:29:59,970
Phase II are conjugation.

456
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:02,990
Phase I expose a
functional group.

457
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:06,330
Phase II transfer
a hydrophilic

458
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:08,850
substance from
a cofactor.

459
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:12,010
Phase I
metabolites may be

460
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,870
inactive, active, toxic.

461
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:17,490
Phase II metabolites
are hydrophilic,

462
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:20,950
readily excreted, and
almost always inactive.

463
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:24,910
True or false?
Phase II reactions

464
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:27,270
must follow Phase
I reactions.

465
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,510
No, that's
false, of course.

466
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:32,050
Drugs that have a
polar functional group

467
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:35,570
already exposed on their
structures may directly

468
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:39,070
undergo a Phase II
conjugation reaction.

469
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:44,270
What types of drug
metabolites frequently

470
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:47,710
undergo enteropatic
circulation? The

471
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:52,630
glucuronide metabolites,
which may go

472
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:57,110
through the kidney, or
they may be secreted

473
00:30:57,110 --> 00:31:00,510
into the biliary
system by P

474
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:03,890
-glycoprotein efflux or
by passive diffusion.

475
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:06,990
These are two
methods by which

476
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,450
drugs get into the
biliary system.

477
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:12,910
Bacteria that express
beta-glucuronidase

478
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:15,150
cleave the
glucuronide, releasing

479
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:18,370
free drug, which is
then reabsorbed by

480
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:21,890
passive diffusion in
the terminal ileum.

481
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:25,210
Excretion now.

482
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:32,270
The kidney is by far
the most frequent

483
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:38,590
route of excretion
of drugs and

484
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:42,010
metabolites and lots
of other things.

485
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:45,790
They eliminate
polar compounds

486
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:47,390
more efficiently
than substances

487
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:49,470
with high lipid
solubility.

488
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:55,550
Renal drug handling.

489
00:31:56,210 --> 00:32:01,860
They may be filtered
from the blood in the

490
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:04,320
glomerulus. So let's
say this is the

491
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,890
glomerulus. This is drug
going in through the

492
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:11,390
afferent arteriole.
The blood goes through

493
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:14,730
the capillary system
in the glomerulus and

494
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:18,950
goes out through the
efferent arteriole.

495
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:23,430
And meanwhile, the
plasma gets filtered by

496
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:26,700
this capillary system
that has fenestrations

497
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:30,910
or spaces in between
the capillaries, and

498
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:39,810
the drug or metabolites
go into the nephron.

499
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:43,330
Another way to get
them in, because

500
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:46,290
plasma, only about
20% of plasma

501
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:48,830
gets filtered at
any pass through.

502
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:53,810
There is a tubular
capillary network that

503
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:56,770
goes around the nephron.
Don't go by this

504
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:59,590
picture, it doesn't
really show you, because

505
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:01,830
it's intended to show
you something else.

506
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:08,090
Drug in the
bloodstream can also be

507
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:11,090
secreted into the
nephron. So those

508
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:13,010
are two pathways
to get in there,

509
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:15,150
glomerular filtration,

510
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:17,870
active tubular secretion.

511
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:22,230
Remember, drugs that
are bound to proteins

512
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:24,530
are not going to
be able to pass

513
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:27,410
through the glomerulus,
only free drug.

514
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:28,430
Okay,

515
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:32,590
now, drug passes
through the nephron,

516
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:35,130
various things happen
in the nephron, you'll

517
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:37,370
learn about that in
the renal system. And

518
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:41,490
it can get into the
distal tubule where it

519
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:46,550
can be, if it is
lipophilic and active

520
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:50,610
drug, it can be
reabsorbed back into the

521
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:53,490
bloodstream and travel
around the body again.

522
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:58,710
If not, it will be
excreted in the urine.

523
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:01,270
That's the basic idea.

524
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:04,950
glomerular filtration
or active tubular

525
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:07,230
secretion to get
into the nephron,

526
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:12,570
passive reabsorption
out of the distal

527
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:15,570
tubule if it is
lipophilic, and

528
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:18,230
otherwise it gets
excreted in the urine.

529
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:22,690
Altering the urinary
pH to favor ionization

530
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:27,430
can enhance excretion
of charged species,

531
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:30,690
charged forms of weak
acids or weak bases.

532
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:38,050
renal function is not
constant even in the

533
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:40,810
healthy person the
neonate's renal function

534
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:43,990
is low compared with
body mass but matures

535
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:46,810
rapidly within the first
few months of birth

536
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:50,330
adults experience a
slow decline in renal

537
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:54,610
function inexorable
elderly patients may

538
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:57,470
have substantial kidney
function impairment,

539
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:01,910
even if it's not
caused by disease.

540
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:04,110
And of course,

541
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:06,350
both acute and
chronic disease can

542
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:08,130
certainly modify
renal function.

543
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:13,090
Here's a better picture
of the glomerulus

544
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:16,430
and the capillary
network inside here.

545
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:22,150
There are big
spaces, it's kind of

546
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:24,370
indicated by these
little dots here.

547
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:27,590
Those are big spaces
where plasma gets

548
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:31,650
filtered through
into the nephron.

549
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:35,370
Filtered because it
takes in the plasma and

550
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:37,250
solutes anything
that's dissolved in

551
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:40,550
the plasma, but keeps
out the proteins.

552
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,250
Oops, excuse me,
wrong button.

553
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:49,030
The takeaway here,
this is what you are

554
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:52,730
expected to remember.
the glomerular filtration

555
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:56,830
rate is a determinant
of renal function we

556
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:59,830
will be talking about
renal function when it

557
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:02,350
comes to drug therapy
over and over and over

558
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:05,090
and what we're talking
about is the ability

559
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:08,510
of the glomerulus to
do its filtration job

560
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:12,870
glomerular
filtration rate is a

561
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:16,310
useful measure of
renal function there

562
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:18,950
are limitations
it is a biomarker.

563
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:23,130
Glomerular filtration
rate is the

564
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:26,330
sum of all of the
functioning nephrons

565
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:28,690
and it is a
rough measure of

566
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:30,970
the number of
functioning nephrons.

567
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:33,850
The rate of filtration.

568
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:42,210
Serum creatinine
and creatinine

569
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:46,810
clearance are
estimates, biomarkers

570
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:48,950
of glomerular
filtration rate.

571
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:54,470
Creatinine is the end
product of creatine

572
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:56,630
metabolism from
skeletal muscle.

573
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:59,270
Please don't confuse
these two terms.

574
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:03,010
Creatinine
production is stable.

575
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:07,270
Creatinine is filtered
through the glomerulus

576
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:10,130
and a small amount
is secreted and

577
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:15,020
it's not reabsorbed.
So that's why measuring

578
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:18,890
creatinine in the
blood or creatinine

579
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:23,870
in the urine is an
estimate of glomerular

580
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:26,610
filtration rate. The
rate at which creatinine

581
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:31,270
passes through is
essentially equal

582
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:35,350
to GFR. And I'm saying
essentially there

583
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:38,990
are drawbacks, but
that's a lecture for a

584
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:42,700
later time. Nonetheless,
it's still a

585
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:48,770
frequently used indicator
of renal function,

586
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:53,630
and we use it for
renal dosing, dosing

587
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:56,470
for individuals who
have renal impairment.

588
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:01,910
I'm not going to ask
you to memorize these

589
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:05,070
various equations
and there are a

590
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:10,930
number of automatic
equations that you can

591
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:13,490
get where you just
put in the numbers and

592
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:15,510
the computer will
work it out for you.

593
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:18,670
Creatinine clearance
is determined by

594
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:22,250
collecting a timed
urine sample. 24 hours

595
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:26,510
sample is the
standard of care and

596
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:28,550
clearance is then
expressed in milliliters

597
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:31,210
per minute. That's
how we talk about GFR

598
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:34,830
and milliliters per
minute of clearance.

599
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:39,610
So let's check the
knowledge again. I invite

600
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:43,510
you to pause the video
and see if you can

601
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:45,930
come up with these
answers from your memory.

602
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:50,530
Okay so let us return.

603
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:54,530
What are the processes
involved in renal

604
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:56,710
excretion of drugs
and metabolites?

605
00:38:57,690 --> 00:39:01,090
Molecules not bound to
plasma proteins enter

606
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:04,700
the kidney via
glomerular filtration or

607
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:08,190
act of secretion into
the proximal tubule.

608
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:10,470
If lipophilic, they
may be passively

609
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:14,010
reabsorbed in the distal
tubule. If not, drugs

610
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:16,650
and metabolites are
excreted in the urine.

611
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:20,290
What is the most
frequently used biomarker

612
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:24,930
of kidney function serum
creatinine also urine

613
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:27,970
creatinine which requires
a urine collection

614
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:32,270
over time serum
creatinine is a blood

615
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:37,210
test glomerular filtration
rate shows how well

616
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:41,170
the kidneys are filtering
and finally what

617
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:44,250
is the clinical
relevance of gfr on drug

618
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:48,310
therapy A low GFR means
kidney function is

619
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:52,750
impaired, which means
drugs may not be excreted

620
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:56,370
at the usual rate
and can accumulate in

621
00:39:56,370 --> 00:40:00,090
the blood, increasing
the risk of toxicity.

622
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:02,810
This is why we care.

623
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:05,970
Drug therapy may
need to be adjusted,

624
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:08,890
and we call this
renal dosing.

625
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:13,630
And finally, variation
in drug response.

626
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:17,610
Many, many factors
can impact the rate at

627
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:23,130
which drugs are cleared,
are eliminated, and

628
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:26,470
these need to be taken
into consideration

629
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:29,610
when considering
drug therapy for your

630
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:33,830
individual patient,
whether it's for adjustment

631
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:37,350
of dosing or possibly
avoiding certain

632
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:42,870
drugs. This wheel lists
all of these different

633
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:46,810
things that it could
be and I'd like to

634
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:55,270
also add to it genetic
variability. Don't

635
00:40:55,270 --> 00:41:00,290
forget about that. This
is becoming much easier

636
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:05,170
to identify as screening
tests are becoming

637
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:08,230
more available and
more affordable the

638
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:15,970
older patient and the
neonates i'll focus

639
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:19,690
on them for the older
patient there may

640
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:22,190
be multiple concurrent
diseases that are

641
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:24,610
going to affect
your drug therapy so

642
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:28,830
drug disease
interactions intestinal

643
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:31,670
intestinal motility may
be reduced blood flow

644
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:34,210
may be reduced muscle
mass may reduced

645
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:38,450
body fat may be
increased kidney function

646
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:41,370
reduction liver
function reduction and

647
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:43,610
then just general
structural and functional

648
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:45,530
changes in the brain
that can occur.

649
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:47,350
In the neonate, they

650
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:49,490
have immature processes,

651
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:51,830
absorption, distribution,

652
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:53,710
metabolism,
and excretion.

653
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:57,080
We have to be
very, very careful

654
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:57,970
dosing them,
and it should

655
00:41:57,970 --> 00:41:59,900
be left to the
neonatologist.

656
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:03,190
Blood flow, GI function,

657
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:06,310
they are just little
bags of water,

658
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:08,250
especially the
********* babies.

659
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:12,570
lower plasma protein
binding capacity

660
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:15,770
because their livers
are not producing them

661
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:18,210
to the same degree
as in the older

662
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:23,770
child even the older
infant low activity

663
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:25,990
of the drug
metabolizing enzymes and

664
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:29,100
transporters they're
not mature yet lower

665
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:33,270
glomerular filtration
rate potentially or

666
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:37,170
even higher glomerular
filtration rate.

667
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:43,630
So in summary, I have
put you a little mind

668
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:47,030
map again. If you find
these helpful, make

669
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:48,890
them yourself. You
can make simple ones.

670
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:51,470
They don't have to be
complicated and they

671
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:54,590
can help you connect
the dots as it were.

672
00:42:56,170 --> 00:42:57,950
Here's another one.

673
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:02,390
And biotransformation
is a complex

674
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:05,230
process involving
numerous enzyme systems

675
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:08,730
that usually detoxify
the xenobiotics.

676
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:13,850
Xeno meaning
foreign or not

677
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,630
occurring naturally
in our bodies.

678
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,410
Phase I reactions include
oxidation, reduction,

679
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:23,470
hydrolysis. These
processes unmask a

680
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:26,170
polar functional group.
And the products may

681
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:31,850
be inactive, usually,
or active or toxic.

682
00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:35,410
Phase II reactions
involve the addition

683
00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:37,530
of a subgroup, and
that's called a

684
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:41,630
conjugation, with the
drug or metabolite.

685
00:43:42,610 --> 00:43:46,050
These are the
glucuronide, I should

686
00:43:46,050 --> 00:43:48,170
say glucuronide,
not glucuronate,

687
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:50,830
acetate, sulfate,
methylate,

688
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:52,370
and glycine groups.

689
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:54,710
The enzymes that
catalyze the

690
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:56,890
reactions are
called transferases.

691
00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:03,610
they transfer the
subgroup supplied

692
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:05,770
by a cofactor
onto the substrate

693
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:08,850
phase two metabolites
are significantly

694
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:10,890
more hydrophilic
than the substrate

695
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:13,530
and are readily
excreted usually

696
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:18,450
definitely most frequently
in the urine drugs

697
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:20,710
metabolized by both
phase one and phase

698
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:24,130
two reactions may undergo
phase 1 before phase

699
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:27,430
2 or go directly to
phase 2 or there may be

700
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:30,910
complicated metabolic
reactions occurring.

701
00:44:31,310 --> 00:44:34,790
Drug disposition is also
affected by membrane

702
00:44:34,790 --> 00:44:37,010
transport proteins
which mediate the

703
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:40,350
cellular uptake and
efflux of xenobiotics in

704
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:44,050
the liver, kidney, and
many many many other

705
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:50,050
tissues. The Phase I
CYP enzymes biotransform

706
00:44:50,050 --> 00:44:53,270
most xenobiotics. CYPs
are expressed in a

707
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:55,910
high concentration in
the membrane of the

708
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:58,910
smooth endoplasmic
reticulum of the liver and

709
00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:01,310
in lower concentrations
in other tissues.

710
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:04,950
CYPs are relatively
non-selective. A

711
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:08,950
small number of P450
isoforms metabolize

712
00:45:08,950 --> 00:45:11,230
thousands and
thousands of drugs.

713
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:15,470
CYP3A4 is the most
abundant isoform

714
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:18,770
metabolizing in some
estimates, in most

715
00:45:18,770 --> 00:45:21,410
estimates, about
50% of all drugs.

716
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:25,250
Enzyme activity can
vary due to concurrent

717
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:29,110
administration of other
drugs that inhibit

718
00:45:29,110 --> 00:45:32,330
or induce the drug
metabolizing enzymes.

719
00:45:32,850 --> 00:45:35,670
Enzyme inhibition
can reduce the

720
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:37,890
rate of metabolism
of the substrate

721
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:40,710
drug, leading to
increased systemic

722
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:43,430
levels, increased
bioavailability.

723
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,330
Enzyme induction
increases the

724
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:48,910
rate of metabolism
of the substrates,

725
00:45:48,910 --> 00:45:51,770
reducing bioavailability.

726
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:55,770
CYP enzyme activity
is quite variable

727
00:45:55,770 --> 00:45:58,550
due to pharmacogenetic
variabilities.

728
00:45:59,050 --> 00:46:02,010
These are genetic
polymorphisms,

729
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:05,230
in other words,
switches in the

730
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:11,290
amino acid positions
in the DNA.

731
00:46:11,290 --> 00:46:14,430
So these are genetic
changes that exist

732
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:16,730
in at least 1% of
the human population.

733
00:46:16,730 --> 00:46:24,450
So this is the study
of pharmacogenomics.

734
00:46:33,070 --> 00:46:35,710
Most drugs are excreted
in urine, either

735
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:37,830
as the parent compound,
that is to say the

736
00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:41,790
unchanged drug, active
drug, or as metabolites

737
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:44,270
with polar characteristics.
Minor routes

738
00:46:44,270 --> 00:46:46,850
of excretion include
sweat, saliva, tears,

739
00:46:46,850 --> 00:46:48,910
skin, hair, and
certainly breast milk.

740
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:51,990
Think baby.

741
00:46:55,550 --> 00:46:58,890
The processes
involved in renal

742
00:46:58,890 --> 00:47:00,910
elimination are
glomerular filtration

743
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:04,130
and or active
tubular secretion,

744
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:07,150
passive tubular
reabsorption of

745
00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:09,510
lipophilic drugs,
and then excretion in

746
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:11,770
urine. Only free
drug molecules, those

747
00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:13,870
that are not bound
to plasma proteins,

748
00:47:13,870 --> 00:47:16,070
are filtered by
the glomerulus.

749
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:19,210
The concentration of
drug excreted in urine

750
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:21,330
results from the amount
of drug introduced

751
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:24,670
to the nephrons through
glomerular filtration

752
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:27,910
and secretion in
the proximal tubule,

753
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:31,030
minus the amount
reabsorbed in the distal

754
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:35,190
tubule, and that gets
excreted, obviously.

755
00:47:38,570 --> 00:47:42,070
Interindividual
variations can affect

756
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:44,650
the rate and extent
of drug elimination.

757
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:48,530
Serum creatinine and
creatinine clearance

758
00:47:48,530 --> 00:47:51,590
are biomarkers of
renal function. They

759
00:47:51,590 --> 00:47:54,890
are used to estimate
the glomerular

760
00:47:54,890 --> 00:47:58,190
filtration rate in the
assessment of kidney

761
00:47:58,190 --> 00:48:00,350
function for the
individual patient.

762
00:48:02,070 --> 00:48:05,050
The dose and frequency
of administration

763
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:08,750
required to achieve
therapeutic blood and

764
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:12,070
tissue levels vary
in different patients

765
00:48:12,070 --> 00:48:14,730
because of the individual
differences in drug

766
00:48:14,730 --> 00:48:16,790
distribution, rates
of drug metabolism,

767
00:48:16,790 --> 00:48:20,290
and elimination. These
are determined by

768
00:48:20,290 --> 00:48:23,630
genetic factors and non
-genetic variables such

769
00:48:23,630 --> 00:48:26,970
as age, ***, liver
size, liver function,

770
00:48:27,230 --> 00:48:29,910
circadian rhythm,
body temperature,

771
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:32,190
nutritional,
environmental factors,

772
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:34,830
concomitant
exposure to inducers

773
00:48:34,830 --> 00:48:37,850
or inhibitors of
drug metabolism.

774
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:42,870
Here's why we care.
understanding and

775
00:48:42,870 --> 00:48:45,290
employing pharmacokinetic
principles can

776
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:48,670
