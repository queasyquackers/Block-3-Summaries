1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,760
Welcome students to the

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,220
Pharmacology
of Antibiotics.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,820
The Aminoglycosides
is the topic of this

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:11,220
lecture in our series.
Dr. Goldstein speaking.

5
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,600
Please don't be afraid
to contact me if you

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,860
feel like you need
help with pharmacology

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,520
and you can
come by yourself

8
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,160
or bring your friends.

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,540
We can do a Zoom or
in-person meeting.

10
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:36,960
Select the learning
objectives, mechanisms,

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,420
mechanisms,
mechanisms, as always,

12
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,560
because mechanisms
form the

13
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,840
foundation of
your knowledge as

14
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,080
a student and
as a physician.

15
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:50,760
I'm inviting you also

16
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,120
to apply your knowledge.

17
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,560
Preparation
materials and links.

18
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:08,040
This group of drugs,
the aminoglycosides in

19
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,100
the following lecture,
the protein synthesis

20
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:14,780
inhibitors, targets
are in the bacterial

21
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:19,360
ribosome. These are
two figures showing the

22
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,760
bacterial ribosome. On
the left, it's what it

23
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,740
more or less looks like,
and the features of

24
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:32,120
it, the action points
have been colored in.

25
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:36,260
And on the right
-hand side is a figure

26
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:39,060
representing the
bacterial ribosome.

27
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,410
We're going to be
talking about the

28
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:47,140
protein synthesis
process. The sites

29
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:54,380
are the A site
where this tRNA with

30
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:58,500
the attached amino
acid will settle to

31
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,560
start the process
and move it along.

32
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:06,400
And I'll go into
more detail when we

33
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:11,720
get to that point. The
drugs are indicated

34
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:15,000
here by the letters.
These are the

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,520
points at which they
have their binding

36
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,920
sites, I've added
the amino glycosides

37
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,680
here. We'll talk
more about that.

38
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,300
Protein synthesis,

39
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,740
and this is your
key points that I'm

40
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,800
not going to read
you these slides.

41
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,520
They're here for
your overview if

42
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,940
you wish. You can
use them for a

43
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,600
summary. You can
use them to learn

44
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,700
all you need to
know if you wish.

45
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:49,500
Watching the videos,
watching the video

46
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,180
lectures is completely
optional. If you would

47
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,980
rather get the new
learning from a

48
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,120
different resource,
please by all means do so.

49
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,000
Definitions here.

50
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,780
The bacterial ribosome
is made up of two

51
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:11,160
components, the 30s
and the 50s. The S is

52
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,580
a sedimentation rate
that indicates the

53
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,940
mass of these different
features in the

54
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:21,160
ribosome, 30S being
smaller than the 50S.

55
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:28,000
It's made up of RNA
and it translates the

56
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,560
mRNA into protein. So
that's the machinery.

57
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,640
Within the ribosomes we

58
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,700
have our 16S
ribosomal RNA,

59
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:41,880
which is on the
30S ribosome, and

60
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,920
that's the A site,
the attachment

61
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,880
site. And we have
our 23S ribosomal

62
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,440
RNA on the 50S
ribosome, and

63
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:55,260
that's the peptidyl
transferase site.

64
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,420
Those are the main
definitions that

65
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,140
you're going to
need to know in

66
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,320
order to understand
the protein

67
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,880
synthesis process
and inhibiting it.

68
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,700
More key points for you.

69
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:23,530
Finally, this one.

70
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,790
I put here the

71
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:28,010
spectinomycin.

72
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:30,270
It's part of the protein

73
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,810
synthesis inhibitors.

74
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:34,410
It's rarely used.
It's not even

75
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:36,630
available in the
United States, but it

76
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,390
could still appear
on a board exam,

77
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:40,550
so I want to make
you aware of it.

78
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:42,890
I'm not going to be
talking about it.

79
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:47,250
Here are the steps
in the bacterial

80
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,290
protein synthesis
process, pretty much the

81
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,870
same as any protein
synthesis process.

82
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:56,830
Bacterial ribosome
is different, is

83
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,890
structurally
different, different in

84
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:04,410
size also, than
our human mammalian

85
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:08,530
eukaryotic protein
synthesis machinery.

86
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:14,350
It is a 70S ribosome.
That's what this whole

87
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:17,950
business is called.
The two together, 70S,

88
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,870
made up of the 30S that I

89
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:24,650
mentioned before,
and the 50S.

90
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:31,150
Within it are the
sites in which

91
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:34,930
the proteins
are synthesized.

92
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:38,290
To repeat, here
is the transfer

93
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:41,030
RNA, tRNA bringing
in the amino

94
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:43,190
acid and it will
settle right here

95
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:45,830
in the A site,
the acceptor site.

96
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:49,450
We see the amino
acid sitting right

97
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:54,310
here. a bond will form
with the amino acid

98
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:59,770
that's next to it
as the tRNA moves

99
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:04,090
over to the peptidyl
transferase site so

100
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,810
we get that bond
formation and the

101
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:11,170
protein lengthens and
it's here in the so

102
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,550
-called exit tunnel
imagine this is a

103
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:15,750
little tunnel the
proteins are coming out

104
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:20,970
and here we have the
cytoplasm coming out

105
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:24,790
into the cytoplasm of
the bacterial cell.

106
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:33,390
Then when that bond
has been formed and

107
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:37,230
the tRNA now loses
that amino acid, it

108
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:41,250
moves off and out. And
then another one will

109
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,790
come back in and
dot, dot, dot, on and

110
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:46,400
on until the protein
is finished. And

111
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:52,650
there's a codon that
will indicate finish.

112
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:54,670
We're not going
to go into that.

113
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:59,650
Sites here,
tetracycline and the

114
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:04,770
aminoglycosides
are here at the so

115
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:08,190
-called A site,
the 16S ribosomal

116
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:11,030
RNA. The difference
between them,

117
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:16,370
well, the main
difference is their

118
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:20,710
actual mechanism of
action. Also, the

119
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:22,950
aminoglycosides
are irreversible.

120
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:27,010
They bind irreversibly.
All of the other

121
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:30,490
protein synthesis
inhibitors bind reversibly.

122
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:35,110
The other protein
synthesis inhibitors

123
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:38,860
have sites of
action in the 50S

124
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,490
ribosome. We'll
get to that in more

125
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:43,130
detail when we get
to those drugs.

126
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:50,930
The starred drugs
are the ones that you

127
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:54,250
need to know by name.
These are frequently

128
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:59,770
used, important
drugs, and each one of

129
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,470
them can appear on a
board exam by name.

130
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:07,030
Gentamycin, Tobramycin,

131
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:08,810
Amikacin,

132
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:10,630
Streptomycin,

133
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:12,130
Neomycin.

134
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:17,150
Plazomycin is
a more recent

135
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:19,030
addition to the group.

136
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:21,770
Peromamycin has been
around a long time.

137
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:24,690
We'll talk more
about this when

138
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:28,170
we get to the
parasitic drugs.

139
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:32,370
They all work
basically the same.

140
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:36,250
They are amino
sugars. I put a

141
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,170
picture of an amino
sugar up here.

142
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:43,130
They are connected
by glycosidic bonds.

143
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:49,250
They are highly polar
cations, water soluble.

144
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:52,150
They're more active
in alkaline pH than

145
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:55,330
in acid pH, so their
efficacy in an acidic

146
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:59,370
environment is somewhat

147
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:02,370
lower than in
an alkaline pH.

148
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:06,450
Irreversible, I mentioned
that before. They

149
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:09,590
are bactericidal. This
is another difference

150
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:12,030
with the other
protein synthesis

151
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:15,300
inhibitors, which are
largely bacteriostatic.

152
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,890
What are they used
for? Well, they're

153
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:26,730
active against aerobic
gram-negative organisms.

154
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:29,830
This is what we see
their major use,

155
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:32,670
major use.

156
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:37,130
Aerobic gram
-negative organisms.

157
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:41,990
Thinking what should
be popping into

158
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:44,070
your head mainly
here would be

159
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:46,790
the gut bugs, the
enterobacteriales.

160
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:50,130
They're also
active against

161
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:54,570
aerobic gram
-positive bacteria,

162
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:57,450
streptococci, enterococci,
staphylococci.

163
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:01,970
Now there's a little
bit of information here

164
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:06,330
you need to appreciate
that, and that is that

165
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:08,850
the gram-positive
have a thick cell wall

166
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:11,750
and the gram-negative
have a thin cell wall.

167
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:13,490
Well,

168
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,750
the aminoglycosides
have to get through

169
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,050
this thick cell
wall. Remember, it's

170
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:23,050
a nice matrix in order
to get to the site

171
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:27,010
of action inside
the bacterial cell.

172
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:36,350
And when given together
with a cell wall

173
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:38,670
inhibitor, and what
should be jumping to

174
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:43,210
your mind here, beta
-lactams especially,

175
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:47,670
the beta-lactams
now break down that

176
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:50,270
cell wall and the
aminoglycosides

177
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:54,650
reach the site
of action in high

178
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:57,490
enough concentrations
to be effective.

179
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:04,830
The aminoglycosides
properties are all related

180
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:09,750
really to that that
amino glycoside water

181
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:14,190
soluble polar structure
water soluble and

182
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:19,710
polar at physiologic
pH naturally so they're

183
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:24,650
given IV IM or
intrathecally they are not

184
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:28,270
absorbed from the GI
tract they are polar

185
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:32,270
they can also be used
topically they can be

186
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:36,670
put in ophthalmic drops
So think not oral.

187
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:41,310
They distribute an
extracellular fluid

188
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:45,970
because of their water
solubility. So imagine

189
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:51,010
if your patient has
extra extracellular

190
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:54,150
fluid because of edema
or fluid overload.

191
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:56,830
That's going to affect
the volume of distribution

192
00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:00,130
which is going to
affect the dosing.

193
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:03,910
Poor ***********
into tissues that

194
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:08,950
are inflamed.
This is low pH and

195
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:11,510
more acidic pH and
inflamed tissues.

196
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:15,290
Tissues that have
low oxygen because

197
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:17,790
they have they
require oxygen which

198
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:19,980
we'll talk about for
their distribution

199
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:23,490
into the site of
action and they

200
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:26,450
have poor ***********
into the CSF.

201
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:30,430
And in the rare
cases that it's

202
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:33,850
necessary, they can
be given intrathecally

203
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:36,050
right into the
spinal fluid.

204
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:41,270
Patients who have
meningitis, if we're

205
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,490
treating them for
meningitis, recall

206
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:47,590
that they have
leakier blood-brain

207
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:49,690
barrier because of
the inflammation.

208
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:52,470
And therefore,
an intravenous

209
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:55,310
administration
will achieve the

210
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:58,250
levels that are
needed in the CSF.

211
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,170
So,

212
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,670
intrasecal CNS, but we

213
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,000
don't do that
for neonates.

214
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:06,590
For one thing, they
have leakier blood

215
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:08,510
-brain barriers
anyway because

216
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:12,730
they're immature.
High concentrations

217
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:17,270
accumulate in renal
tubular cells and

218
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:20,890
endolymph and
perilymph of the ear.

219
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:27,570
Accumulate in kidney
cells and ear cells.

220
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:32,130
Think toxicities here.

221
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:37,050
They cross the
placenta. Think

222
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:39,710
about potential
fetotoxicity.

223
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:43,430
They're rapidly
eliminated by glomerular

224
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:47,110
filtration. They're
that tiny, soluble

225
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:51,490
molecule that
dissolves in the plasma

226
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:56,730
and follows and is
excreted through the

227
00:13:56,730 --> 00:14:01,710
glomeruli along with
the plasma. plasma.

228
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,150
Half-life is only about

229
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,970
two to three
hours usually.

230
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:09,810
Ah, but imagine
people who have

231
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:11,450
significant
renal impairment

232
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,630
can be as long
as two days.

233
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:16,870
So it's very important

234
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:21,890
to adjust dosage in
patients who have

235
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:25,010
renal impairment. And
patients who receive

236
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:26,610
these These
aminoglycosides are

237
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:30,670
normally very ill, and
their renal function

238
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:36,390
is possibly fine
when they start, but

239
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:39,990
remembering the
nephrotoxicity of these

240
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:43,810
drugs, the renal
function can drop.

241
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:49,230
So this has to be
monitored so that

242
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,570
the drugs can be
dosed properly,

243
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:54,970
and they have
significant toxicity.

244
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,950
Aminoglycosides are
cleared by the kidney.

245
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:05,250
Clearance is directly
proportional to

246
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,710
serum creatinine.
I'm sure you remember

247
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:10,870
that from pharmacokinetic
selectors.

248
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:14,870
Therefore, rapid
changes in renal

249
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:17,330
function can occur
in the critically

250
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:20,130
ill, which is
patients who get these

251
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:23,650
drugs, patients
with acute kidney

252
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:26,330
injury, septic
shock, major surgery.

253
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:30,530
Therefore we need to
monitor. So what are

254
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,990
we going to monitor?
Serum creatinine

255
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:37,070
because of the
relationship to clearance.

256
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:41,250
Follow me?

257
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,430
Any questions?

258
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:51,790
Okay the pharmacokinetic
pharmacodynamic

259
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:55,490
profile. It is
concentration

260
00:15:55,490 --> 00:16:00,190
dependent, the maximal
concentration or

261
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:05,310
peak to the MIC ratio,
and this indicates

262
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:09,350
that the higher the
drug concentration,

263
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:11,550
that's what this
symbol means,

264
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:16,790
the faster the rate
and the greater

265
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:19,970
the extent of
bacterial killing,

266
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:22,970
concentration
-dependent killing.

267
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:27,590
Aminoglycosides also
have a significant post

268
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:30,790
-antibiotic effect,
where suppression of

269
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,790
bacterial growth
persists beyond the time

270
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:36,110
during which measurable
drug is present. In

271
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:38,750
other words, when it
falls below the MIC.

272
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,630
This is why, even
though it's got such a

273
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:45,070
short half-life, two
to three hours, it can

274
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:49,970
be given once a day
for most indications.

275
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:58,110
It also is associated,
the efficacy is

276
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:02,850
associated with the
24-hour area under the

277
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:06,990
concentration versus time
curve to the MIC ratio.

278
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:11,910
Within the literature
for all of these

279
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:13,870
antibiotics that
we're talking about,

280
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:17,550
goals have been
defined. And since we're

281
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:21,650
talking about gram
-negative bacilli as

282
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:25,210
being what these drugs
are mainly used for,

283
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:27,990
these have been defined.

284
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:30,350
So what does all of this

285
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:33,420
mean? It means dosing.

286
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:38,890
The dose that
is associated

287
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:43,890
with clinical
effect, which is

288
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:46,890
based on the AUC
to MIC ratio.

289
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,990
A little picture
to help remind you.

290
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,345
We have our peak,
concentration,

291
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:02,370
area under the
concentration versus time

292
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:04,770
curve is indicated
with these lines.

293
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:07,500
Here's our
minimum inhibitory

294
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:12,890
concentration and
time, over time.

295
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:20,270
So it's drug administration,
area under the

296
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:24,310
concentration versus
time curve. Now, some

297
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:30,810
few cases will use
the original so-called

298
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:34,970
low-dose aminoglycoside
dosing strategy,

299
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:42,550
which is the same total
amount of dose in the

300
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:47,890
24-hour period, but
it's divided, it's given

301
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:50,690
every eight hours,
the frequency of every

302
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:53,050
eight hours. So the
peaks are going to be

303
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:55,650
lower because it's the
lower dose for each,

304
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:58,830
it's the lower
amount of drug being

305
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:02,870
given for each dose,
drops off, we see

306
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:05,490
it stays, really
stays above the MIC

307
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:09,370
for the grant
majority of the time.

308
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:11,950
Give another dose,
falls off, give another

309
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:18,010
dose, falls off.
So, for monitoring,

310
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:21,730
the blood levels are
going to be measured

311
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:24,770
right before the
next dose is given,

312
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,910
trough levels.

313
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,330
Mechanism now.

314
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:35,690
Aminoglycosides
passively diffuse across

315
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:38,190
porin channels in
the outer membrane.

316
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:40,330
So, we're obviously
talking about gram

317
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:45,650
-negative bacteria. then
are actively transported

318
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:47,890
across the cell
membrane to the

319
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:52,290
cytoplasm by an oxygen
-dependent mechanism.

320
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:59,910
Oxygen-dependent
aerobic organisms.

321
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:02,990
Because aerobic
organisms are using

322
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:05,090
that oxygen
-dependent mechanism.

323
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:09,210
Anaerobic organisms
are not using oxygen.

324
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:14,750
Well, once inside,
they bind to

325
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:18,950
the 16S ribosomal
RNA on the 30S

326
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:23,730
ribosome, and they
appear to have at

327
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:26,930
least three
separate mechanisms.

328
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:32,150
They block the formation
of the initiation

329
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:39,110
complex, which is
indicated here.

330
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:46,650
they cause miscoding
so they they misread

331
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:52,510
the message on the
mRNA and as a result

332
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:54,750
the wrong amino acid
gets incorporated

333
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:59,270
so that's indicated
here and they prevent

334
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:02,650
it from moving along
the translocation

335
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:07,590
of the tRNA movement
along the mRNA.

336
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:12,790
So those three
mechanisms have

337
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:16,870
been observed
experimentally.

338
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:20,510
Now other things
may be happening.

339
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:25,450
Maybe these wrong
proteins, because the

340
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,810
amino acids, wrong
amino acids have been

341
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:32,670
inserted, might be
causing some damage, and

342
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:41,170
a formation of a
monosome. So these amino

343
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:46,390
glycosides are binding
to bacterial polysomes.

344
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:49,090
I'll talk about that
on the next slide.

345
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:56,270
Polysomes are several
ribosomes strung

346
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:58,730
out along the mRNA
strand and this is

347
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:02,410
typical of bacterial
protein synthesis.

348
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:07,050
These dots here are
indicated indicating

349
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:11,770
the ribosomes and
all these little

350
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:13,730
strands coming
out those are the

351
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:17,270
proteins in various
lengths and phases.

352
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:22,390
So if one of the
things the amino

353
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:25,510
glycosides does is
the formation of

354
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:29,390
this single monosome,
then the bacteria

355
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,690
is not properly
making its proteins.

356
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:35,610
Here's a drawing
to help you

357
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:39,010
visualize better
what you're seeing

358
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:41,270
in the electron
micrograph.

359
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:50,270
Spectrum of activity,
I've referred to this

360
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:52,470
a couple of times
now, aerobic gram

361
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:55,360
-negative bacilli, so
the enterobacteriales,

362
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,630
and pseudomonas,
pseudomonas aeruginosa,

363
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:03,130
which is an aerobic
gram-negative bacterium

364
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:08,710
that's not enteric,
and the aerobic gram

365
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:12,370
-positive streptococcus,
Staphylococcus

366
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:16,930
enterococcus, as I
mentioned, and I wrote

367
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:20,110
it out here, poorly
********* intact thick

368
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:26,450
peptidoglycan cell
wall and clinically are

369
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:30,090
not reliably effective
when used alone.

370
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:33,350
Aminoglycosides are
almost always used

371
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:36,350
with another drug,
certainly for

372
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:39,910
treatment of the gram
-positive infections

373
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:46,070
and frequently,
almost always, for the

374
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:48,690
treatment of gram
-negative infections.

375
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:53,710
So what is
intrinsically resistant?

376
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:55,610
Well, anaerobic bacteria,

377
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:58,930
right? They're not
using an oxygen

378
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:01,590
-dependent system.
They're not

379
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:04,350
metabolizing
oxygen. Facultative

380
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:06,770
anaerobes in an
anaerobic environment,

381
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:08,750
anaerobic, anaerobic.

382
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:11,750
Acquired
resistance. This is

383
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,750
certainly of
importance because

384
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:16,350
of the big
resistance problem.

385
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:19,270
Inactivation by
production of

386
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:22,730
transferases. This is
the main mechanism.

387
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:26,890
Transferases that
inactivate the drug,

388
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:33,530
they will transfer
another group onto the

389
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:35,530
drug which will
inactivate it by

390
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:38,470
phosphorylation,
adenylation, and acetylation.

391
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:44,290
organisms that prevent
its entry or pump

392
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:48,870
it out so impaired
accumulation within the

393
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:54,370
organism an oxygen
dependent transport

394
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:57,210
system that doesn't
bring the amino

395
00:24:57,670 --> 00:25:02,570
glycoside in or target
alteration this is

396
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:05,630
mainly seen with
streptomycin in the

397
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:09,030
treatment of mycobacterium
tuberculosis.

398
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:13,250
Cross resistance
can occur,

399
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,850
but is unpredictable.

400
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:16,730
Susceptibility tests

401
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:19,750
will guide therapy. What

402
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,130
do we use them for?
Serious infections.

403
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,120
That's it.

404
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:33,200
They are quite toxic.

405
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:38,120
So empirically,
aerobic, gram-negative

406
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,760
bacilli, along with
other antibiotics.

407
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,860
Gentamicin and
tobramycin are

408
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:49,170
the first two,
mainly gentamicin.

409
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:55,080
Amikacin is good when
there's resistance.

410
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,940
Always used in combination
with antibiotics

411
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:02,460
from another class
to broaden the

412
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:06,400
spectrum. There is
one exception to that.

413
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:11,820
Infective endocarditis.
This is a gram

414
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:16,160
-positive infection.
The aminoglycosides are

415
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:19,620
used together with
a cell wall active

416
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:24,640
drug, penicillin,
ampicillin, ceftriaxone,

417
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:29,300
and possibly vancomycin
if the person can't

418
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:32,130
get one of these
beta-lactams because

419
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,740
these drugs will break
down the cell wall,

420
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:38,380
increase the uptake
of aminoglycosides,

421
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,440
in addition to
the fact that

422
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,880
aminoglycosides
together with the cell

423
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,680
wall inhibitor
have a synergistic

424
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,900
effect. So uptake
and synergy.

425
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:55,340
Uptake and synergy for
infective endocarditis,

426
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:58,980
which is a gram
-positive infection that

427
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:01,410
can be caused by any
of these organisms.

428
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:05,440
Directed therapy.

429
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:10,480
So we know what the
infective organism is,

430
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,980
and we know what the
susceptibility of

431
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:16,040
that organism is to
the various potential

432
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,580
antibiotic therapies
that could be used.

433
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,800
When established, the
antibiotic therapy

434
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,900
should be changed to a
less toxic antibiotic

435
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:29,420
if appropriate. So
now, let's say we have

436
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:32,000
the aminoglycoside on
board together with

437
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,760
other drugs for empiric
therapy. We find

438
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:39,040
out what the organism
is sensitive to and

439
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:42,960
switch it over to a
less toxic antibiotic.

440
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:46,080
If the
aminoglycoside is the

441
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,900
most appropriate
therapy, then

442
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,260
of course we
stick with that.

443
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:53,920
Prolonged aminoglycosides
is limited

444
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,640
to life-threatening
infections

445
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:59,080
unresponsive to
less toxic agents.

446
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,540
That's the
takeaway with the

447
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:04,400
therapeutic uses
of aminoglycosides.

448
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:07,380
Aerobic gram
-negative bacilli,

449
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,820
aerobic gram-positives,

450
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,940
short duration of
therapy, switch to

451
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:17,220
directed therapy
when appropriate. So

452
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:24,310
let's talk about
these different

453
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:26,970
drugs within the
aminoglycosides

454
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:28,950
group. How do
they compare?

455
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:31,430
When do you use one
and not the other?

456
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:34,710
Gentamicin and
tobramycin are

457
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:36,410
pretty much the
same, really.

458
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:40,650
Tobamycin seems to have
slightly more activity

459
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:43,550
against Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, and

460
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:46,730
you're likely to see
it used more frequently

461
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:50,110
when you are in your
clinical environment.

462
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:52,950
for patients who have

463
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:54,810
pseudomonas aeruginosa.

464
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:59,630
Gentamicin seems to
be more active against

465
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:02,950
the gut bugs, the
enterobacteriales, and

466
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:06,390
you'll see that most
often used for the

467
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:10,310
aerobic gram-negative
non-pseudomonas

468
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:14,210
infections. Will gentamicin
work for a pseudomonas

469
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:17,310
infection? Yes.
Will tobramycin work

470
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:21,110
for an enterobacterialis
infection? Yes.

471
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:27,630
Gentamycin is the one
that's used for the

472
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:30,070
synergistic combination
for the treatment

473
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:34,510
of infective
endocarditis caused by

474
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:37,850
enterococcus faecalis
or enterococcus

475
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:41,110
faecium. And this is
the situation when it's

476
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:44,530
given every hours
instead of once a day.

477
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:48,010
It is known to be
efficacious that way.

478
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:51,470
Zoonoses.

479
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:56,630
So these arthropod
usually arthropod

480
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:00,190
transmitted infections.

481
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:03,870
Tularemia which
is also known as

482
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:06,310
rabbit fever and
has other names and

483
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:10,530
plague. Bubonic
plague. Black plague.

484
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:15,310
Plague is is one of
those that I think

485
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:16,550
you're going to
want to remember

486
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:19,250
because of its
historical significance.

487
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:27,410
Tobermycin is available
in oral inhalation

488
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:29,670
for the treatment
of Pseudomonas lung

489
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:32,930
infection in cystic
fibrosis patients

490
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:35,510
who are at risk for
getting these. It would

491
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:38,930
be the preferred
inhaled type for

492
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:42,550
pseudomonas lung
infection. It produces a

493
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:46,950
high concentration of
drug right there in

494
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:51,590
the lung where the
infection is, and

495
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:55,170
there's very little
systemic side effects

496
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:57,630
because of this route
of administration.

497
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:03,130
Amicusin now was
developed originally

498
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:06,690
because it is more
active against gentamicin

499
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:10,010
and tobramycin
-resistant infections,

500
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:12,870
gram-negative
bacterial infections,

501
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:15,610
GNB, gram
-negative bacteria.

502
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:19,110
It's also effective
for the treatment

503
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:23,450
of multidrug-resistant
tuberculosis, but

504
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:29,050
But other of the
aminoglycosides

505
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:30,830
may also be used for the

506
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:33,030
multidrug-resistant
tuberculosis.

507
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:37,030
Plazomycin, as I
mentioned, is the

508
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:39,210
most recent addition.
It doesn't have a

509
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:41,290
star on it. I think
it's important for

510
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:43,470
context that I
mention it, however.

511
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:47,970
It has only two
indications.

512
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:51,330
Complicated urinary
tract infections

513
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:54,890
that don't respond
to any other drug.

514
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:58,330
And also for the
treatment of plague.

515
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:05,370
Streptomycin has really
limited uses because

516
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:09,270
there's a great deal
of gram-negative

517
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:12,470
resistance against
it. So tularemia and

518
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:17,050
plague and multidrug
-resistant tuberculosis.

519
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:20,010
It's easy to remember,
easy to remember.

520
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:22,770
Neomycin is
only topically,

521
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:23,830
it's really toxic.

522
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:25,920
I mean, all of these
are really toxic,

523
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:29,730
given systemically,
neomycin especially.

524
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:35,270
So it's usually mixed
together with another

525
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:38,630
drug. Maybe you've heard
of neosporin, where

526
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:41,530
it mixes with another
antibiotic to broaden

527
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:46,390
the spectrum for
dermatologic infections.

528
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:50,870
it's not absorbed,
so it can

529
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:53,470
be given ******
to reduce bowel

530
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:57,070
flora prior to
bowel surgery.

531
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:04,050
And so skin, ophthalmic
drops, otic drops.

532
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:08,110
Interestingly,
hypersensitivity can frequently

533
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:10,970
occur with neomycin
-containing products,

534
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:15,360
so you get that
allergic dermatitis. so

535
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:20,690
recap gentamicin most
frequently used tobermycin

536
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:23,430
as effective slightly
better against

537
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:27,510
pseudomonas aeruginosa
gentamicin slightly better

538
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:33,740
against the gut bugs
amikacin for multi

539
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:38,230
-drug resistant
tuberculosis for gentamicin

540
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:41,010
resistant gram-negative
bacterial infections

541
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:44,630
Plazomycin also
is active against

542
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:47,230
resistant strains,
but it's only for

543
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:51,650
multidrug-resistant
UTIs caused by gram

544
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:55,570
-negative bacteria
when other drugs have

545
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:58,190
been ineffective
and also for plague.

546
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:03,070
Streptomycin has
limited use, the

547
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:06,110
zoonoses, tularemia,
and plague, and

548
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:08,250
multidrug-resistant
tuberculosis.

549
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:11,910
Neomycin, topical
only, hypersensitivity

550
00:34:11,910 --> 00:34:15,690
reactions are
relatively common.

551
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:21,210
Now, I mentioned
toxicities I don't

552
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:23,250
know how many times
by now. There are

553
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:26,670
only really three
easy to remember.

554
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:28,490
Kidney toxicity,

555
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:31,310
nephrotoxicity,
ear toxicity,

556
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:36,890
ototoxicity, and
neuromuscular blockade,

557
00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:39,270
which isn't a problem
for most people

558
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:42,670
but I'll talk about
when it is a problem.

559
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:45,270
Of course, there
are risk factors.

560
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:47,290
This said,

561
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:50,930
over duration of
therapy, generally

562
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:52,850
longer than five
days, so we're

563
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:54,470
not talking about
a long time,

564
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:59,770
the risk of nephrotoxicity
is very high.

565
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:03,550
Many, many patients,
even most patients,

566
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:10,470
will develop toxicity
but people who

567
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:15,210
have are of advanced
age of course have

568
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:17,910
insufficient kidney
function because

569
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:20,590
the plasma concentrations
will be higher

570
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:24,310
persistently elevated
concentrations of

571
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:29,210
drug in the plasma
which it could also be

572
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:32,070
dose related so you
have to be make sure

573
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:36,970
the dose is correct
and this is an and

574
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:41,890
therapy more than five
days and in fact the

575
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:49,270
recommendation is no
more than 48 hours

576
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:55,890
if possible previous
exposure to aminoglycosides

577
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:58,250
so maybe people
have hearing loss

578
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:01,110
because of a previous
previous exposure.

579
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:04,710
And then any other
drugs that also

580
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:07,550
cause nephrotoxicity
and ototoxicity.

581
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:17,810
So how does this happen?

582
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:20,770
Aminoglycosides
accumulate in the

583
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:23,330
proximal tubular
cells and this

584
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:26,850
they cause progressive
tubular cell

585
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:30,090
damage and glomerular
dysfunction.

586
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:34,810
They are toxic to
the host cells.

587
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:38,230
More likely with
the longer course

588
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:39,950
of therapy, more
likely with the high

589
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:42,770
dose extended
interval dosing,

590
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:49,690
sorry, more likely
with the high dose.

591
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:55,510
Notice that the
extended interval

592
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:58,190
dosing has less
nephrotoxicity.

593
00:36:58,190 --> 00:36:59,170
So what does that mean?

594
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:06,380
This is the extended
interval compared to...

595
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:12,810
The reason that has
been proposed is that

596
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:17,990
during this time below,
in this time frame

597
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:22,000
in which the patient
receives no drug, the

598
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:29,030
aminoglycoside has a
chance to at least start

599
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:35,150
to leave the affected
kidney and ear cells.

600
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:38,890
Fortunately, the renal

601
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:40,950
impairment is
often reversible,

602
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:45,890
unlike the
ototoxicity, which

603
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:47,850
might not be reversible.

604
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:50,290
It can be
irreversible once

605
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:52,210
those sensory
cells are lost.

606
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,110
Associated with a
high-peak plasma,

607
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:58,610
duration of
aminoglycoside therapy.

608
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:02,430
This high-peak plasma

609
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:04,490
levels, this is
so confusing.

610
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:06,410
This is traditional.

611
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:11,470
This is a
traditional view.

612
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:19,490
to the, as I said in
the previous slide,

613
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:25,230
with that long time frame

614
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:27,410
before the drug
is given again,

615
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:33,610
it has a chance to
come out. But once

616
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:36,370
these hair cells are
lost, they're lost.

617
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:42,190
cochlear toxicity which
is degeneration of

618
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:46,390
the hair cells and
neurons and a person

619
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:51,010
might complain that
they have this sort of

620
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:53,930
buzzing or ringing
sound in their ears

621
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:58,350
that's a sign that
that's a symptom that

622
00:38:58,350 --> 00:39:02,110
there is damage to
those hair cells and

623
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:05,430
vestibular toxicity
that's the dizziness part

624
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:11,250
And now neuromuscular
blockade.

625
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:15,250
Acute neuromuscular
blockade can cause

626
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:18,550
respiratory paralysis.
This isn't going to

627
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:22,110
occur in otherwise
healthy individuals. It

628
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:25,670
occurs in people
who already have a

629
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:30,610
neuromuscular problem,
such as myasthenia gravis,

630
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:34,130
or patients who
are receiving a

631
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:39,110
neuromuscular blocker
for surgery, for example.

632
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:42,650
What's the mechanism?

633
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:47,490
Well, it is believed
that the aminoglycosides

634
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:55,690
block a prejunctional
calcium channel.

635
00:39:56,230 --> 00:40:01,180
We have here a
picture of the nerve

636
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:05,390
coming into the
skeletal muscle.

637
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:08,850
And here we have the
synapses occurring.

638
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:12,870
This is a close
-up picture on

639
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:14,710
the right side.
We have all

640
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:16,770
this neurotransmitter
in here.

641
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:25,010
and when a message
comes down the axon

642
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:29,270
it will cause
depolarization and opening

643
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:32,290
of calcium channels
and calcium will

644
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:39,770
rush in and the belief
is that by blocking

645
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:42,950
these calcium
channels, that prevents

646
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:46,670
the movement of the
vesicles containing

647
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:50,350
the neurotransmitter
from moving to

648
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:54,590
the edge and releasing
their contents.

649
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:58,350
So less neurotransmitter
means less

650
00:40:58,350 --> 00:41:02,870
activation of the end
plate potential, and

651
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:07,230
that could lead to
respiratory paralysis.

652
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,870
streptomycin
has the other

653
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:17,290
toxicities but
also it has some

654
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:20,030
neurotoxicities and
we see that with

655
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:23,490
toxicity to the
optic nerve something

656
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:26,090
called a scotoma
which is a blind

657
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:28,010
spot and I've given
you a picture of

658
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:30,390
what that might
look like and also

659
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:32,930
peripheral neuritis
the paresthesias

660
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:37,250
The strange feeling
around the mouse,

661
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:40,770
the nervy feeling
around the mouse,

662
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:43,210
the face, the
hands are common.

663
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:47,370
It occurs rapidly
and may persist for

664
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:49,290
several hours, but
it does go away.

665
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:52,650
Hypersensitivity
reactions,

666
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:56,330
naturally, and this
hot, tender mass

667
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:59,270
can form at the
injection site.

668
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:04,490
Cautions.

669
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:06,090
Myasthenia gravis, I

670
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:07,750
referred to that before.

671
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:11,010
This is a
neuromuscular disease.

672
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:13,330
It's an
autoimmune disease

673
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:15,210
that causes
muscle weakness.

674
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:17,690
And if these
patients already have

675
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:20,190
muscle weakness, adding
an aminoglycoside

676
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:23,430
can exacerbate
that and lead to

677
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:25,770
respiratory depression.
That's the worry.

678
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:28,510
These patients are
going to be in the

679
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:31,450
hospital. And if
they absolutely need

680
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:33,910
an aminoglycoside,
that has to be

681
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:37,910
carefully monitored,
this side effect.

682
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:41,650
Pregnancy,
congenital bilateral

683
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:44,850
deafness can occur
and has been seen,

684
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:46,630
has been reported
in the fetus.

685
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:48,950
Renal toxicity,
makes sense, doesn't

686
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:51,090
it? It's the two
major toxicities

687
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:53,610
that happen to just
about everybody

688
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:57,910
when the drug is
given long enough.

689
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:01,870
Also, in pregnancy, just

690
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:03,250
as a general statement,

691
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:07,870
their pharmacokinetic
parameters change as

692
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:12,630
the pregnancy progresses.
So, an increased

693
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:14,950
volume of distribution,
and that's going to

694
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:23,490
decrease the peak
concentration, and there

695
00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:25,750
will be a shorter
half-life because of

696
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:28,590
increased clearance by
the pregnant individual.

697
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:34,030
not recommended. A lot
of these antibiotics

698
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:37,530
are not recommended
for lactation, but

699
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:42,030
the risk here is
that the babies

700
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:45,830
will take in the
antibiotic and that

701
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:48,170
will wreak havoc
with their own

702
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:50,790
intestinal flora and
lead to diarrhea.

703
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:53,110
Drug interactions.

704
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:56,650
Well, certainly
no metabolic drug

705
00:43:56,650 --> 00:44:00,110
interactions because
it's not metabolized none

706
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:03,730
of them but other drugs
that are nephrotoxic

707
00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:06,510
other drugs that
are ototoxic and

708
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:10,210
we've already met
vancomycin which I put

709
00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:13,130
in bold because this
is something that you

710
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:16,470
should be remembering
vancomycin causes

711
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:21,310
nephrotoxicity on
its own And we talked

712
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:28,270
about vancomycin plus
an aminoglycoside,

713
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:33,810
gentamicin, for
infective endocarditis.

714
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:40,670
So nephrotoxicity
is a problem. But

715
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:44,550
infective endocarditis
must be treated.

716
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:47,870
and if this is the only
treatment vancomycin

717
00:44:47,870 --> 00:44:50,690
plus an amino
glycoside then that's

718
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:52,870
what it has to be
there are other options

719
00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:54,430
but you can learn
about those later

720
00:44:54,430 --> 00:44:58,110
and i've listed out
several others that

721
00:44:58,110 --> 00:45:00,110
i'm not asking you to
memorize now because

722
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:02,990
you haven't met those
drugs yet in our

723
00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:05,710
pharmacology lectures
but you should

724
00:45:05,710 --> 00:45:08,670
remember neuromuscular
blockers i did not

725
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,770
bold it, but you
need, I'm bolding it

726
00:45:11,770 --> 00:45:14,550
now. Bold, bold, bold,
bold, bold, bold.

727
00:45:15,870 --> 00:45:18,370
Because of the
neuromuscular

728
00:45:18,370 --> 00:45:20,370
blocking effect.
You don't have to

729
00:45:20,370 --> 00:45:22,170
remember the
names right now.

730
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:25,110
We'll get to those
at a later lecture.

731
00:45:25,110 --> 00:45:29,650
But neuromuscular
blockers, bold, bold.

732
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,140
So in summary,

733
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,640
aminoglycosides
in current use are

734
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,920
streptomycin, gentomycin,
tobromycin, amikacin,

735
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,840
plasomycin, neomycin,
and peromomycin.

736
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:49,400
Amino sugars, parenteral

737
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,420
only for systemic
infections,

738
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:53,540
not absorbed from
the GI tract,

739
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:56,000
distributed to
extracellular fluid, renal

740
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,260
excreted by
glomerular filtration.

741
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:00,480
So what do we measure?

742
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:08,160
Serum creatinine to
help us keep track

743
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,480
of the patient's
kidney function.

744
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:20,280
They bind 16S, I
should say, RNA on

745
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:23,880
the 30S ribosome,
probable mechanism

746
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:26,840
interference with the
initiation complex,

747
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:30,320
misreading the mRNA
and incorporating

748
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:34,260
the wrong amino
acid, and inhibiting

749
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:37,280
the translocation
along the mRNA. A.

750
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:40,840
Aminoglycosides are
active against aerobic

751
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:44,360
gram-negative bacteria.
Combined with a

752
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:46,780
cell wall inhibitor,
aminoglycosides enhance

753
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:52,120
the efficacy of
aerobic gram-positive

754
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:57,340
bacterial infection,
infective endocarditis.

755
00:46:57,340 --> 00:46:59,880
The most frequent
mechanism of resistance

756
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:03,700
is drug-inactivating
enzymes, acetylation,

757
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,660
phosphorylation,
adenylation,

758
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:09,740
which confer high
-level resistance.

759
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:12,450
There can be some
cross-sensitivity.

760
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:17,180
Amicacin and
plasomycin have

761
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:20,460
activity against
resistant organisms.

762
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:26,560
The aminoglycosides
are used in combination

763
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,500
with a cell wall
inhibitor to treat

764
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,600
the serious gram
-negative infections.

765
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:36,120
including zoonoses,
tularemia, and

766
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:38,940
plague, and infective
endocarditis.

767
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:41,280
Dentomycin, amikacin,
streptomycin

768
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,780
are options for the
treatment of drug

769
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:45,560
-resistant tuberculosis
in combination

770
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:49,000
with other anti
-tubercular drugs.

771
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:52,400
Amikacin and plasomycin
have activity

772
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,640
against the
resistant infections.

773
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:57,300
Amikacin is used
in the treatment of

774
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:00,160
various aminoglycoside
gram-negative

775
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:05,660
bacterial infections.
Plazomycin is for MDR

776
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:08,340
urinary tract
infections, complicated,

777
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:11,120
not responsive to
other antibiotics.

778
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:15,500
Gentamicin, tobramycin,
neomycin are all

779
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:18,500
available in topical
formulations, DERMS,

780
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:21,260
ophthalmic, odic.

781
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:26,580
Neomycin is
topical only, used

782
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:28,860
with others,
other antibiotics.

783
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:33,660
All are nephrotoxic
and ototoxic.

784
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:35,980
Risk factors are
more than five days

785
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:38,160
of use, remembering
that we generally

786
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,920
recommend no more
than 48 hours.

787
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:45,640
So renal insufficiency,
older age, other

788
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:50,040
nephrotoxic and
ototoxic drugs can make

789
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:53,640
it worse. At high
doses, aminoglycosides

790
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:56,000
can produce this
neuromuscular blockade

791
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,180
and that's referred
to as curare-like

792
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:01,280
neuromuscular blockade
because it's like

793
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:06,120
curare and curare is
a natural substance

794
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:09,840
obtained from plants
and it was used by

795
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:14,840
Amazonian natives to
stop their prey from

796
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:17,680
running away. You
put it on the darts.

797
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:24,900
And that concludes
this lecture.

798
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:27,440
Thank you for listening.
