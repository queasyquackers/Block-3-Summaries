1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:01,460
Welcome to your second

2
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:03,120
epidemiology lecture.

3
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:06,240
The session
objectives are similar

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,520
to your first
epidemiology section,

5
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,100
but the measures
we'll be talking

6
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,900
about are a little
more complex.

7
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,340
We will go through
every type of study

8
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,900
design that is important
in epidemiological

9
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:20,380
studies and then follow
with which measures

10
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:22,660
are calculated in
each circumstance.

11
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,960
The take-home here
is going to be that

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,100
there are many study
designs and each one

13
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,920
has benefits and
limitations. Each of them

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,820
have different measures,
and you have to

15
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,620
figure out which
ones to use in which

16
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:38,140
situation so that you
can quantify disease.

17
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,680
With that, we're
going to look

18
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,380
at another
fictitious case.

19
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,080
So let's say that
when you were a child,

20
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,940
your mother constantly
told you that

21
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:48,540
you shouldn't go out
in the winter without

22
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,140
a hat as you'll catch
a cold. Now as a

23
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,660
medical professional,
you're ready to

24
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:54,920
prove her wrong. So
you decide to dedicate

25
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,260
your life to
investigating this issue.

26
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,460
So we're going to
start with a cross

27
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,980
-sectional study. A
cross-sectional study

28
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,780
is a one-time sweep
through a time

29
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:07,180
point to assess the
prevalence of variables,

30
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,600
diseases, and risk
factors. You can

31
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,920
collect the data
first and then divide

32
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,000
people into groups
for comparisons.

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,120
You can't really
talk about risk or

34
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,140
incidence because
it was a one-time

35
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,420
measurement with
no element of time.

36
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:23,780
So how would you do
this? Well, you wouldn't

37
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:26,880
have any regard for
people's cold status or

38
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,480
use of hats. So you
could send out a survey

39
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,140
to a mass general
population asking about

40
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:35,020
both, and then see if
you find associations

41
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,700
between the two. But
the problem is, if

42
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,080
everybody writes down
that they are getting a

43
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,580
cold, or if everybody
says that they wear a

44
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,120
hat, you can't do an
analysis because you don't

45
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,720
have any comparison
groups. So most people

46
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,720
would go with a
different approach where

47
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,280
you're guaranteed to
have two or more groups.

48
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,920
So then let's look at
a case control study.

49
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,280
In a case control study
with two groups, one

50
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,600
group has the disease
of interest, and these

51
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,220
are the cases. The
comparable group is

52
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,860
free from disease, and
these are the controls.

53
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:09,780
The case control study
identifies possible

54
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,680
causes of disease by
finding out how the two

55
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,340
groups differ with
respect to an exposure.

56
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,040
So how would you design
this? So first you

57
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,540
have to find your
inclusion criteria.

58
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:25,180
That is, how do you
define people who get

59
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:28,280
colds? Is it just
somebody who says, I get

60
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,420
colds? Or are you
going to go into their

61
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,320
medical record and
it's certain ICD codes?

62
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,680
Are you going to recruit
from a clinic? Are

63
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,760
you going to put
something out on Facebook

64
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,480
or Instagram or Twitter?
So you have to figure

65
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,080
out how you actually
define a case. Then

66
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,740
you need healthy
controls. And that's not

67
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:51,560
usually as easy as it
sounds, because where

68
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,680
are you going to find
these people? There

69
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,660
are a lot of different
sources. You can use

70
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,300
general population
controls or general medical

71
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,010
clinics. If you
want to do a matched

72
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:03,700
analysis, you'd find
somebody that is in some way

73
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,900
linked to the cases.
So it could be spouses

74
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,280
or friends. You
would then survey the

75
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,800
groups and ask in detail
about their use of

76
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,520
hats. And the goal is
to compare hat wearing

77
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,160
in the cases to hat
wearing in the controls.

78
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,900
Now, selecting the
controls, again, general

79
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,940
population controls
were far easier at a

80
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,120
time where you could
actually do things

81
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,620
like random digit
dialing or get residence

82
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,180
lists or driver's
license records. Those

83
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,560
things, because of
privacy rules and the lack

84
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,540
of anybody having a
landline, have gotten

85
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,140
much, much harder to
do. In addition to

86
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,540
that, if you did
personally get a phone call

87
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,500
and somebody asked
you to take a survey,

88
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,200
my guess is the first
thing you'd do is

89
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,760
hang up. So this isn't
necessarily something

90
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,600
that's easy. Now,
there are methods where

91
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,000
you can recruit
general controls using

92
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,260
sources like Amazon,
but these things may or

93
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,380
may not be the best
approach. And what a

94
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:04,500
lot of people do is try
to figure out whether

95
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,200
this is really going
to get you the right

96
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,580
result. The advantage
being you can make

97
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,820
sure that you recruit
from the same population

98
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,660
as your cases, but
the disadvantage

99
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:17,580
being it's time-consuming
and expensive and

100
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:20,160
you probably won't
get great cooperation.

101
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,620
A lot of people will go
to clinic or hospital

102
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:26,620
controls. The reason
they do this is that

103
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,580
this is a group of
people you might have

104
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,540
access to. So you could
call up your friend

105
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,940
in a different clinic
who's a primary care

106
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,580
doctor and see if they
want to participate in

107
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,080
the study. It's easy
to identify these

108
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,700
patients and accessible,
and the same general

109
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,920
factors led them to the
hospital. And if you're

110
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,480
using your cases from
a hospital, these

111
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,500
may be all people who
have similar health

112
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,960
behavior in terms of
caring for their health.

113
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,460
Also, because they
are all going to

114
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,080
the clinic, their
amount of recall with

115
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,380
what they were doing
or not doing might

116
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,980
be a little more
comparable, and

117
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,860
they're usually more
willing to participate

118
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:07,500
than a general
population control.

119
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,440
There are disadvantages.

120
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:13,880
So hospitals usually
see people who are sick.

121
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,140
Most people don't go
hang out at the hospital

122
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,900
or a clinic because
they feel great. Now,

123
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,200
you may be able to get
somebody who's going

124
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,320
in just for their
general physical, but

125
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,940
this is something you
really need to pay

126
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:27,500
attention to. So just
like you had inclusion

127
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,180
criteria for your cases,
you would have inclusion

128
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,900
and exclusion criteria
for your controls.

129
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,960
Also, depending on
which hospital you

130
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,400
use, it may not
actually have the same

131
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,880
population as your
patients. So these

132
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,620
are all things to
pay attention to.

133
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,100
What illnesses would
actually make good

134
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,850
hospital controls? Well,
really, it would be

135
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:51,420
if they have an illness
and it has absolutely

136
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,780
no relation to the
risk factor that

137
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:56,500
you're studying. So
for example, should

138
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,800
respiratory diseases be
used as a control in a

139
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,580
study of smoking and
myocardial infarction.

140
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,960
That is, do they
represent the distribution

141
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,040
of smoking in the
general population

142
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,540
that gave rise to
the cases of MI?

143
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,420
So probably not.

144
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:14,320
You could, again,
consider special control

145
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,540
groups like friends,
spouses, siblings,

146
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:19,160
even deceased
individuals. However, all

147
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,800
those things have
different mathematical

148
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,300
methods, so it could
complicate things.

149
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,640
People like to match
in epidemiology,

150
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,200
and there are different
ways to do it.

151
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,200
You can do it
individually where it's

152
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,920
each person matched
to somebody, or you

153
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,920
could do it by
frequency where 20% are

154
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,320
a certain age group,
the next 20% are

155
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,080
in a different age
group. But again,

156
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:43,360
analysis has to take
that into account.

157
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,860
Matching can be
great. It can be time

158
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,520
efficient. It can be
cost effective. It can

159
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,720
be good for your
statistics. But the more

160
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,080
things you match on,
the harder it is to

161
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,960
actually find an actual
control. And then

162
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,880
once you've matched
people on things,

163
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,980
you've already interfered
with that variable

164
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:03,240
and you can't actually
study it anymore.

165
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:09,040
So analysis of results
in a case control

166
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,140
study includes the
odds ratio, and

167
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,600
this is looking at
an unmatched study.

168
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,240
And it could be
described either as

169
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,740
odds of exposure in
the diseased divided

170
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,880
by odds of exposure
in the healthy.

171
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,000
Or because in this
case, mathematically,

172
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,540
it just happens to
work, you could also say

173
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:30,600
odds of disease and
exposed versus odds

174
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,880
of disease and unexposed.
So you can kind

175
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:38,000
of see how this is
divided out in a table.

176
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:41,980
You have people
classified as yes or no by

177
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:45,220
disease status, and then
yes or no is exposure

178
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:49,420
status. And you
can see that you've

179
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:52,540
calculated the odds of
disease in the exposed

180
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:55,020
and the odds of disease
in the unexposed,

181
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:58,480
and you just divide
to get the odds ratio.

182
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:02,600
So you can see in
this example where

183
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,760
a fictitious case
has actually been

184
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,840
done, and this is
looking at Parkinson's

185
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,640
disease and coffee
consumption.

186
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,460
And you have your cases
who have Parkinson's

187
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,960
disease and your
controls who are

188
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,440
healthy. And then they're
classified as yes or

189
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,240
no in terms of coffee
drinking. And when

190
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,360
you calculate the
numbers, you get 1.3.

191
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,960
And how you interpret
it is to say a PD

192
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,020
patient is 1.3 times
as likely as a healthy

193
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,740
individual to have
been a coffee drinker.

194
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:39,000
Now, we're not going
to talk a lot about the

195
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,040
statistics because
you have separate

196
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,960
statistics lectures,
but it's hard to mention

197
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,920
epidemiological measures
without also mentioning

198
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,040
the need to think
about statistical

199
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,120
significance. So when
you calculate an odds

200
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,480
ratio the way I did on
the previous page, that

201
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,280
doesn't tell you
whether that result is

202
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,040
statistically significant.
So in real life,

203
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,440
you still need a p
-value. And in general, p

204
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,360
-values below 0.05 are
considered significant

205
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,940
in science, although
that can vary based on

206
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:13,040
the situation. And
when you have a ratio,

207
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,500
you usually also report
something called a

208
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:20,240
95% confidence
interval. And because in

209
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,660
ratios, if you divide
two equal numbers, you

210
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:27,300
get one. One is
considered the null value.

211
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,520
Null doesn't mean zero.
Null means there's no

212
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:34,420
effect. So if in your
division the number

213
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:37,040
that you're getting for
one group is identical

214
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,480
to the other group,
you would divide the

215
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,120
two and get one and
one would be the null

216
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,200
value, meaning there's
no association. And

217
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,500
in this case, it would
actually be reflected

218
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,280
in the confidence
interval. The confidence

219
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,900
interval would have one
in it and that tells

220
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,600
you that it's not
significant. Now, case

221
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,680
control studies are
very good for rare

222
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,940
diseases and diseases
that have a long induction

223
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:04,820
or latent period. The
reason for that is

224
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,900
that if something is
rare, you're better off

225
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,740
collecting it. Otherwise,
it's never going

226
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,480
to happen. If you
collect people without

227
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,280
the disease, but it's
very rare, now you're

228
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,140
having to wait for
the disease to happen.

229
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:18,220
That's not very
efficient. It's much more

230
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:21,500
efficient to do it this
way, which is to go find

231
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,560
the people with the
disease, collect them,

232
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,660
and then base the
study around them. So

233
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:28,440
that is the basis of a
case control study that

234
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,460
you are first picking
people by their

235
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:33,520
disease status. It's good
because you can evaluate

236
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,520
a lot of risk
factors for the same

237
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,200
disease. So if you
don't know a lot about a

238
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,180
disease, which is often
the case with rare

239
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,720
disease, now you have
the opportunity to ask

240
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,340
them about a lot of
exposures, not just one.

241
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:49,040
There are, however,
weaknesses. If it's a

242
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,340
rare exposure, let's
say you're trying to

243
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:56,580
study a very unusual
dietary supplement, the

244
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,520
chances are almost
everybody is going to

245
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,380
say, no, I've never
heard of that. And so

246
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,760
now you're not really
studying it. So this

247
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,580
isn't the best situation.
If the whole goal

248
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,660
of your study is to
find out about a rare

249
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:10,420
exposure, it's also
vulnerable to bias

250
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,340
because it's retrospective.
A case control

251
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:16,080
study is always
retrospective because again,

252
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,360
you've selected
people by disease, the

253
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,020
disease has happened.
so you can only ask them

254
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,900
about what happened in
the past. It's fairly

255
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,380
common to have poor
information about

256
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,820
exposures when they're
retrospective and

257
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,860
because it's retrospective
it's really hard

258
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,100
to infer a temporal
relationship between

259
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,520
exposure and disease.
You weren't there to see

260
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,980
it happen so you don't
necessarily know.

261
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:43,240
So then given that
you decide you don't

262
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,920
want to do a case
control study it's

263
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,060
not optimal so
let's say you decide

264
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,340
I'm going to do a
cohort study instead.

265
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,800
And this is the
right way to figure

266
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,580
out whether or
not I really had

267
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,380
to wear a hat or
whether my mom was

268
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,560
just nagging me.
This is your way.

269
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,840
So in a cohort study,
you have two groups

270
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,340
that don't have disease
at the beginning. So

271
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,660
the hallmark of this
study versus a case

272
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,400
control study is that
absolutely nobody had

273
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,180
disease at the beginning
of your study. You

274
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,770
are then going to
select people by their

275
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:17,680
exposure. So you're
going to pick out the

276
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,620
people who have the
exposure, you're going to

277
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,600
pick out people who
don't have the exposure,

278
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,340
and then you're going
to wait and you're

279
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,740
going to follow them
forward and see who

280
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:29,600
gets the disease. And
is the disease equal

281
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,220
in both groups or is it
the same? Now, I want

282
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,100
to call attention
to the fact that a

283
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:39,340
retrospective study is
also possible within the

284
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,680
definition of a cohort
study. And the reason

285
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,660
for that is that you
have access to things

286
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:47,580
like medical records.
So a retrospective

287
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:50,100
cohort study goes into
the medical record,

288
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,700
and then you have
to imagine your time

289
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:56,000
traveling, let's say,
back 20 years, and you're

290
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,680
going to start reading
the medical record

291
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,120
from 20 years ago. And
so now you actually

292
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,040
have the temporal
relationship because let's

293
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,720
say you're reading
about patient Jane Doe

294
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,460
and you've started
reading about her 20

295
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:12,160
years ago in her medical
record and at the

296
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,640
time she didn't have
the disease and then you

297
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,420
follow through, you're
reading, reading,

298
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,400
reading, and eventually
she gets the disease.

299
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,360
So it's still a cohort
study because the

300
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,180
beginning of your study
definition period,

301
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,120
everybody is going
to be disease-free,

302
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,900
but in actuality
it's retrospective

303
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,000
because everything
has actually happened.

304
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:35,260
So how would you
design a cohort study?

305
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,820
Let's just say you're
going to design a regular

306
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:40,360
prospective cohort
study. Well, here,

307
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,860
again, everybody has
to be healthy, but

308
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,100
first you'd recruit the
people who wear hats.

309
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,640
That's your exposure.
So you're going to,

310
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,820
again, decide on your
inclusion criteria.

311
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:52,620
Is it all hats? Is
it wool hats? Can a

312
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:55,700
beret be okay? This
is, I mean, obviously a

313
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,980
silly example, but
you do have to be very

314
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,680
nitpicky in terms
of really designing

315
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,640
medical research. And
then you would have to

316
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,760
find the control group
with no exposure or

317
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,780
people who say, I
would never wear a hat.

318
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:09,180
Then you would follow
them through time to

319
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,640
calculate an incidence
rate of colds in

320
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,440
the hat wearers versus
the non-hat wearers.

321
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,940
It is a very good study

322
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,710
designed for
rare exposures.

323
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,980
Again, when something's
rare, you're

324
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,820
best off collecting
people who have that.

325
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,640
In a retrospective
cohort study, it's

326
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,160
actually very efficient
for diseases that take

327
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,080
a long time. So if it
has a long induction

328
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,640
or latent period,
I mean, you're just

329
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,620
reading. It's a lot
different than having to

330
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,560
sit around waiting for
the disease to happen.

331
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,300
It's all happened,
and you can just read

332
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,900
about it. And you
can, again, evaluate

333
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,420
multiple effects of an
exposure. So it's kind

334
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:49,620
of reverse of a case
control study. So if

335
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,920
you say, my goal is
to study the exposure

336
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,020
of hats on colds,
that's fine, but there's

337
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,020
nothing to stop you
from asking about

338
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,920
migraines, heart attacks,
whatever you want

339
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,180
to ask about, because
all those things

340
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,680
theoretically are going
to happen after the

341
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,040
exposure, and so you
can ask about anything.

342
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,900
You do have a temporal
relationship if

343
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,860
it's a prospective
study, and you can get

344
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,880
pretty good information
on the exposures,

345
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,460
so it's a little less
vulnerable to bias.

346
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,940
There are weaknesses.
It's not great for a

347
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:25,580
rare outcome. So if a
disease is just rare,

348
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,000
honestly, you could
collect a whole bunch

349
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,920
of people and maybe
one person gets the

350
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,120
disease or maybe nobody
gets the disease.

351
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:37,920
So then again, in this
case, it just wouldn't

352
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,000
make sense to go with
this study design.

353
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:42,580
If it's retrospective,
you might have

354
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:45,000
poor information on
exposure and other

355
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,800
variables because
again, remember, we're

356
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,200
talking about things
like medical records. And

357
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,460
that information
wasn't gathered to do

358
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,640
medical research. It was
gathered for clinical

359
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,540
reasons. So doctors
and nurses have

360
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,540
jotted down exactly
what they need to jot

361
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,840
down to stay compliant,
but they're busy,

362
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,220
they're in a hurry,
and they had no idea 20

363
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,700
years later somebody
is going to look at

364
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,480
this for research. So
honestly, the variables

365
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,560
may not be recorded
in the best way.

366
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,780
But the flip side
is when things are

367
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:14,640
prospective, it's
expensive, it's time

368
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,080
-consuming, and again,
it's not great for

369
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,360
diseases that are
rare or that take a

370
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,860
very, very long time
to happen. So these

371
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,580
are the things to keep
in mind when you're

372
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,680
comparing with a
case control study.

373
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,820
Now, the basic
analysis of a cohort

374
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,700
study doesn't look
that different than

375
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,960
the analysis of a
case control study.

376
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:37,900
The table looks
almost identical.

377
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:42,040
And so once again, you
have disease status

378
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,800
and you have exposure
status. But what

379
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,560
makes this table
different than the case

380
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,680
control study table
really has to do with the

381
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,140
study design. The table
itself looks almost

382
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:56,300
identical. But if you
look, you no longer

383
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,280
have to calculate an
odds. You can calculate

384
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,940
an incidence rate.
And an incidence

385
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:04,860
rate is considered far
superior to an odds.

386
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,800
So when you're allowed
to do one, you do

387
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,140
that. The reason you
can do the incidence

388
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,880
rate is that everybody
was disease-free at

389
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,440
the beginning of the
study. So anything you

390
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,740
had in your study
period is considered

391
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:21,200
new disease. And so
all a relative risk is,

392
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,800
is an incidence rate
in one group divided

393
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,180
by the incidence rate
in the other group.

394
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:29,560
Now, in this kind of
study, you can also

395
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,200
get some additional
measures. You can get

396
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,240
something called an
attributable risk,

397
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,890
which is based on
subtraction, But what

398
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,720
you most often see
is the relative risk.

399
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,880
And again, it would
look like this. And

400
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,400
interpreting it is really
identical to a case

401
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,040
control study. We're
not going to spend a

402
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,020
lot of time on it
because this isn't a

403
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:55,580
statistics lecture. But
again, when you have a

404
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,960
relative risk of one,
that was because you

405
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,500
divided two identical
numbers. Both groups

406
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,160
had the same incidence
rate, and that's the

407
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,740
same as saying no
risk. Above one is an

408
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:09,580
elevated risk. Below
one is a reduced risk.

409
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:13,300
Okay, so let's just
say all of these study

410
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,700
designs to you just
seem substandard and you

411
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:19,280
found out the gold
standard in epidemiology

412
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,540
studies is a randomized
controlled trial.

413
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:25,180
Now, this is absolutely
the case. So most

414
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:29,780
of the time when a
drug goes to market or

415
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:33,300
when a procedure is
recommended, it's gone

416
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,440
through a randomized
controlled trial, and

417
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,100
that's what's required
in order to actually

418
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,840
go forward on a new
medical treatment. So

419
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,000
let's say in this case,
you decide to spend

420
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,920
all of your time,
money, and effort, and

421
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,340
you create a controlled
winter chamber,

422
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:51,180
and you recruit 400
people to live under a

423
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,180
controlled setting
where you're going to

424
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:56,200
randomize people into
a hat or no hat group.

425
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,580
Now this may seems
silly, but I don't know

426
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,460
how many of you have
seen they actually have

427
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:05,980
these weird frozen
chambers for people now

428
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:09,020
where people can go
stand in the cold on

429
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:12,260
purpose. So this is
actually a doable study.

430
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:15,580
The huge difference
here is that you

431
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,460
have randomized
people. This isn't

432
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,140
what they chose
to do in nature.

433
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,780
It's where you put
them. And the benefit

434
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:24,140
in it is that if
you randomized,

435
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,500
then there's less
bias. People aren't

436
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,240
self-selecting
things. And the

437
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,040
analysis is actually
same as the cohort

438
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,920
study. You can get
a relative risk.

439
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,980
So a randomized
control trial allows a

440
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,900
couple of things that
other study designs

441
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,600
don't allow. The
first is the use of a

442
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,000
placebo, which can be
used to make groups

443
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,360
as comparable as
possible. And the

444
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,900
second is blinding.
So you can make it so

445
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,560
that it's single
blind, where subjects

446
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,240
don't know whether
they're getting treatment

447
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,480
or placebo or
double blind where

448
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,820
nobody knows who's
getting the treatment.

449
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,180
And the purpose of
this, of course,

450
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:32,360
attributable risk.
Okay. We're going to

451
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:35,280
shift to talking
about some more nitty

452
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:38,260
gritties of studies.
So we've talked about

453
01:02:38,260 --> 01:02:41,000
study designs as
though disease and

454
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:44,120
exposures are very,
very clean cut, but in

455
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:45,900
actuality, they're
not clean cut at all

456
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:49,320
because human beings,
unlike lab rats, are

457
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:51,780
not genetically
identical. They don't

458
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:54,860
have identical
environments. They each

459
01:02:54,860 --> 01:02:58,080
have a bunch of factors
that also affect

460
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:01,120
disease, and this is
what confounding is.

461
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:04,400
Confounding is talking
about an alternate

462
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:06,880
explanation for the
observed association

463
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:09,040
between an exposure
and a disease.

464
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:13,120
So what if you see that
those who wear hats

465
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:15,760
get fewer colds, but
then you dig a little

466
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:17,860
deeper and you find
out the same people

467
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:20,620
who wear hats also wear
gloves and scarves.

468
01:03:20,620 --> 01:03:22,800
So what if it was
really the scarf that

469
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:24,880
protects against colds?
Maybe the hat had

470
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:27,780
nothing to do with it.
So in this particular

471
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:30,060
study, the scarf
became a confounder

472
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:31,600
because you weren't
trying to study the

473
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:33,760
scarf, but that's what
you ended up getting.

474
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:37,000
So this is why you
collect data on

475
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,980
variables other
than the ones you're

476
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:41,700
studying and the common
ones that everybody

477
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:44,800
asks about are age,
gender, and race. You

478
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:47,800
can address confounding
by stratification or

479
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:50,520
with more complicated
regression analysis.

480
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:53,220
Regression is beyond
the scope of this

481
01:03:53,220 --> 01:03:55,920
class, but we will
talk about stratifying.

482
01:03:56,240 --> 01:04:00,320
So here's an example
where you are

483
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:04,020
looking at a situation
where you want to

484
01:04:04,020 --> 01:04:05,940
know about heart
attacks and smoking.

485
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:08,940
So let's just say
your composite

486
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:11,500
OR. OR stands
for odds ratio.

487
01:04:11,660 --> 01:04:13,800
Composite means that
you didn't account

488
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:16,140
for anything. You did
the math exactly how

489
01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:19,320
I showed you. You
only looked at heart

490
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:21,880
attacks and it was a
yes or a no. And then

491
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:23,660
you looked at smoking
and it was a yes or

492
01:04:23,660 --> 01:04:26,520
a no. And you got an
odds ratio of 2.15.

493
01:04:26,980 --> 01:04:30,220
But then you decide,
I need to make sure

494
01:04:30,220 --> 01:04:32,420
that there's no
confounding. So you decide

495
01:04:32,420 --> 01:04:34,140
you're going to
stratify. You look at the

496
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:36,620
males and you look at
the females separately.

497
01:04:36,620 --> 01:04:39,760
And now you calculate
the odds ratio and

498
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:41,440
you see that it's
different than what

499
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:44,080
you got as the
composite. What happened

500
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:48,020
here is that there was
confounding by gender.

501
01:04:48,020 --> 01:04:50,440
And then when you
teased it out, when

502
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:52,380
you put people in
their own categories,

503
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:55,600
you see that there
is a new odds ratio.

504
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:58,920
Now, you can tell
that it's confounding

505
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:01,640
because the new odds
ratio is pretty much

506
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:04,620
the same in males and
females. So now you

507
01:05:04,620 --> 01:05:08,400
can say one is the
true odds ratio. But

508
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,220
you want to keep
this in mind when we

509
01:05:10,220 --> 01:05:12,500
compare it to effect
modification, which we're

510
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:15,200
going to talk about,
because here again,

511
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:17,280
with confounding,
you're seeing that

512
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:20,680
both numbers are one.
Once you stratified,

513
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:22,360
you got a new odds
ratio, but it was

514
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:25,480
identical in both of
your stratified groups.

515
01:05:25,820 --> 01:05:28,740
Effect modification is
a different phenomenon.

516
01:05:28,740 --> 01:05:30,740
It's talking about
when an exposure

517
01:05:30,740 --> 01:05:33,920
behaves differently in
different groups. So for

518
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:36,280
example, if you find
smoking increases the

519
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:38,360
risk for heart attacks
much more in males

520
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:40,560
than females. Now, these
are fictional. It's

521
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:44,180
not based on fact.
But let's just say it

522
01:05:44,180 --> 01:05:47,160
has to do with hormones.
And for whatever

523
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:49,840
reason, women have
additional factors that

524
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:52,740
make them less likely
to be affected. Now,

525
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:55,240
you would have effect
modification. Now, the

526
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:58,040
process of finding
that is similar. So in

527
01:05:58,040 --> 01:06:01,300
this, again, fictional
example, the composite

528
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:05,280
odds ratio was 6.83.
But then I stratified.

529
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:07,560
And now you see for
females, the odds

530
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:10,920
ratio was 3.86, but in
males, the odds ratio

531
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:14,480
was nine. So this is
not confounding because

532
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:17,480
what this is showing
you is that the odds

533
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:19,760
ratio is simply different
if you're a male.

534
01:06:19,860 --> 01:06:23,640
How much the smoking
was affecting the heart

535
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:26,720
attacks, it was much
more so in males than

536
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:29,420
females. So this is
effect modification.

537
01:06:29,660 --> 01:06:33,260
So then the answer to
how you would address,

538
01:06:33,260 --> 01:06:36,480
either interaction or
confounding an analysis,

539
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:38,860
is stratification.
They're very different

540
01:06:38,860 --> 01:06:41,160
things, but they have
the same solution.

541
01:06:41,890 --> 01:06:44,060
Okay, the final thing
we're going to talk

542
01:06:44,060 --> 01:06:47,660
about is bias. So bias
is a systematic error

543
01:06:47,660 --> 01:06:50,600
that results in an
incorrect estimate of

544
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:53,480
your measure of
association. It can go in

545
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:55,780
any direction. It can
say that there's no

546
01:06:55,780 --> 01:06:59,060
association when there
really is one. It can

547
01:06:59,060 --> 01:07:02,560
find an association
and it's not supposed

548
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:05,760
to be there. And we're
not talking about

549
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:08,980
something that is done
on purpose. It's just

550
01:07:08,980 --> 01:07:11,460
something that's
introduced by either the

551
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:13,620
study investigator
or the participants.

552
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:16,160
Now, the word bias
does not mean that the

553
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:18,820
investigator is prejudiced.
It's, again, not

554
01:07:18,820 --> 01:07:21,120
anything people do on
purpose, but it has

555
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:24,480
to do with bad study
design. And it can occur

556
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:28,280
in all study types,
you know, experimental

557
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:30,980
cohort case control.
And it happens when

558
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:33,400
you're designing and
conducting the study.

559
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:35,520
The problem with
it is that you can

560
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:38,300
acknowledge it, but you
can't fix it. There's no

561
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:41,000
statistics that fixes
bias once you're

562
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,980
past the stage of having
collected the data.

563
01:07:44,490 --> 01:07:46,660
We're going to talk
about just a few types

564
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:50,120
of bias. One is
selection bias. So this

565
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:52,920
results from procedures
used to select subjects

566
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:55,760
into a study that
lead to a particular

567
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:58,220
result because of the
way you selected them.

568
01:07:58,220 --> 01:08:02,140
So perhaps you're
looking at a study of

569
01:08:02,140 --> 01:08:06,580
physical activity and
Parkinson's disease, but

570
01:08:06,580 --> 01:08:08,680
you selected everybody
from an exercise

571
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:12,220
clinic. So there's a
selection bias here because

572
01:08:12,220 --> 01:08:15,780
everybody you actually
picked are exercisers.

573
01:08:15,780 --> 01:08:18,400
So this just, again,
it's not something

574
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:20,480
somebody did on
purpose. Maybe they did

575
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:22,680
it because that's who
was available to them,

576
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:25,460
but it's not representative
of Parkinson's

577
01:08:25,460 --> 01:08:27,580
patients who aren't
in an exercise clinic.

578
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:31,720
The other major one
is recall bias. So

579
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:34,860
people don't
necessarily always have

580
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:37,920
accurate memories, and
it can, again, go in

581
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:40,700
any direction. It
could be that people

582
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:43,840
who have a disease
remember or report

583
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:45,860
exposures differently
because they're over

584
01:08:45,860 --> 01:08:47,260
searching their
memories. They're

585
01:08:47,260 --> 01:08:49,280
trying really hard to
find an explanation.

586
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:53,020
But it could also be
that somebody with a

587
01:08:53,020 --> 01:08:55,760
disease feels guilty.
And so they're trying

588
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:58,140
not to actually
remember something that

589
01:08:58,140 --> 01:09:01,240
they did. So it
really just comes down

590
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:05,380
to people's recall is
not necessarily always

591
01:09:05,380 --> 01:09:07,960
the most accurate,
but this is why you

592
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:10,300
try to do things to
kind of mitigate that.

593
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:12,100
So you use controls
who are themselves

594
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:16,040
sick, you standardize
questionnaires, mask

595
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:18,240
subjects, you try to
do what you can, but

596
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:20,940
any study has some
level of bias in it.

597
01:09:21,340 --> 01:09:24,060
There are many other
kinds of biases. We

598
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:25,880
can't cover them in a
lecture, but the concept

599
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:28,500
is always the same.
The study is designed

600
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:30,670
in a way that is getting
you flawed results.

601
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:35,380
Okay, so now we've
gone through several

602
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:39,300
study designs as
well as exactly what

603
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:41,800
you do with those
study designs, how you

604
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:44,180
assess them, the
problems that can occur

605
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:46,020
in them. And the take
-home is that there

606
01:09:46,020 --> 01:09:47,760
are a lot of study
designs. Each one

607
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:49,840
has different benefits
and limitations.

608
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:51,800
Bias confounding
and effect

609
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:54,400
modification can occur
in any study design,

610
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:55,800
and each of
them should be

611
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:58,200
addressed in every
given study design.

612
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:02,060
Okay, so that concludes
this epidemiology

613
01:10:02,060 --> 01:10:04,320
session, and please
just make sure that you

614
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:06,440
understand all of the
listed objectives.
