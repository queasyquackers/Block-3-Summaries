00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:02,940
Hello, everyone in

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,220
Jonesboro and
Old Westbury.

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,240
I'm Dr. Ramos of
the Department of

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,120
Biomedical Sciences,
and I'm very

5
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,700
excited and honored
to be part of your

6
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,880
journey here at
NYTCom to graduation.

7
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,560
This slide basically
has the session

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,460
objectives that are
found on the CPG.

9
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,580
On your own, please
take a look at them

10
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,220
and make sure that
you're comfortable

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,060
with all the
major elements of

12
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:32,940
information that
are going to

13
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,320
be described in
this lecture.

14
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,240
So this lecture is
entitled Introduction

15
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,300
to the Nervous System,
but maybe a better

16
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,260
title would be
Introduction to the

17
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,420
Histology of the Nervous
System because that's

18
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,300
really what I'm going
to be talking about,

19
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,740
the different kinds
of cells in the

20
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,700
nervous system and how
they work together.

21
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,380
You have already had
a great introduction

22
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:59,140
to the nervous
system in your gross

23
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:02,680
anatomy labs and in
your OMM labs. So I

24
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,340
think that you all
already understand

25
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,600
that the nervous system
has connections to

26
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,480
muscles, organs,
glands, and, of course,

27
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,400
the nervous system
has many different

28
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,060
parts and is
interconnected to itself.

29
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,040
And it's these connections
and the activity

30
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,640
of cells that produces
behavior, right? So

31
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,600
cells in the brain
connect to muscles,

32
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,580
which then move the
bones in our body, right?

33
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:34,100
The nervous system
has cells in the eye,

34
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:38,610
in the ear, in
the skin to signal

35
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:45,740
environmental stimuli,
changes in light, sound,

36
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,960
mechanical stimulation
on our skin, right?

37
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,900
And so this is how
we need to understand

38
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:58,020
that the neural activity
creates behavior.

39
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,580
We should also
understand that changes

40
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,400
in the brain, right,
changes in the anatomy

41
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,740
and physiology of
brain cells will

42
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:13,740
cause changes in
behavior. So development,

43
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,740
early brain
development, is a period

44
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,680
where there are many
changes in anatomy and

45
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,280
physiology, and
this correlates with

46
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,760
changes in the behavior
of a growing baby,

47
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,900
right? There are
also changes in the

48
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,100
brain that take place
during normal aging.

49
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,420
There are changes in
the brain that take

50
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,560
place during the
disease process, after

51
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,360
injury, and after learning,
right? So learning

52
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,020
is a great example
where we can observe

53
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,700
a change in behavior
due through some

54
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,980
experience, right? And
that change in behavior

55
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:52,040
manifests from changes
in the connectivity

56
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,620
and physiology of
neural circuits, right?

57
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,760
And so therefore,
treatments for brain

58
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,380
diseases must change
the brain, right? They

59
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,920
must change the brain
back to a more normal

60
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,340
state from the
disease state or the

61
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:11,120
treatments for brain
diseases must stop whatever

62
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,560
pathological changes
are taking place.

63
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,180
And you'll learn about
neurodegeneration

64
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,820
and demyelination,
for example,

65
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,620
that are processes
that change

66
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,660
the anatomy of
the brain and then

67
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,000
lead to behavioral
deficits.

68
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:36,060
All right, let's start
with what I would

69
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:41,340
consider to be the major
players of the brain.

70
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,700
All cells are important,
but understanding

71
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,520
how the neurons are
organized, the neurons

72
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,240
are interconnected,
and the neurons

73
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,780
communicate physiologically
with one another is

74
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,960
so critical to
understanding brain function

75
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,800
and brain disease. So
the neurons are the

76
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,180
main information
carrying cells of the

77
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,980
brain. And what I
mean by that is that,

78
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,800
remember, the neurons,
for example, in the

79
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,700
periphery, connect to
muscles, right? So the

80
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,360
activity of the neurons
is going to cause

81
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,360
muscle contraction and
cause our movements,

82
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,220
right? Right.

83
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:20,380
Neurons in the
sensory organs,

84
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,940
be it the eye, the ear,

85
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,440
the tongue, the skin.

86
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,680
Right. Those cells
communicate information

87
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,260
about environmental
stimuli and bring those

88
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,140
back to the central
nervous system, carrying

89
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,460
information about
what is going on in

90
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,870
the environment and
any kind of behavioral

91
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:43,480
response that needs to
take place. So we're

92
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,920
going to spend most
of the time during

93
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,160
this block talking
mostly about the neurons.

94
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,900
And in this lecture,
we're going to talk

95
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,540
about different parts
of the neuron because

96
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,680
they're important to
understand how these

97
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,760
cells do their special
job. So neurons

98
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,820
are characterized by
a cell body that has

99
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,280
many important
intracellular organelles.

100
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,760
Neurons have branching
dendrites, and

101
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,080
we'll talk about
that. Those dendrites

102
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,020
often have dendritic
spines. Neurons

103
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,040
have an axon initial
segment that comes

104
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,220
out of the cell body.
They have branching

105
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,880
axons and axon
terminals where

106
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,660
neurons make contact
with other neurons.

107
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:29,960
Neurons are electrically
excitable cells

108
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,860
that can release and
respond to transmitters

109
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:36,140
via these connections.
And in a follow-up

110
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:39,800
lecture, we'll talk
about the physiology of

111
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,540
neuronal connections,
right? And something

112
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:45,200
very important is that
neurons, almost all the

113
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,740
neurons in the brain
are produced before

114
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:50,200
birth and almost
entirely non-renewable,

115
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,820
meaning if a neuron
dies, that neuron is not

116
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:58,480
replaced in whatever
circuit that neuron was

117
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:02,620
engaged in, right? So
neurodegeneration or

118
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:06,190
neuronal injury like
you might see following

119
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:11,080
a ****** is going to
result in a permanent

120
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,440
loss of those neurons,
right? And back in

121
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,600
the day, early anatomists
knew that the brain

122
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,260
was important for
behavior and they could

123
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:24,740
distinguish different
parts of the brain and

124
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:27,040
gray versus white
matter. But it was only

125
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:31,760
until there were the
revolution in microscopy

126
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:36,580
and cell staining
that anatomists could

127
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:41,800
look, zoom in onto a
piece of the brain here

128
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,160
and see that there
were many, many diverse

129
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,400
types of brain cells.
you can see just in

130
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:54,220
this really small section
of the neocortex of

131
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:57,390
the human brain we see
many different cells

132
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,760
stained here with
different shapes and sizes

133
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:05,500
and it's these big
cells here that we know

134
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:09,820
are the neurons right
so all these notice

135
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,840
how they these guys
have a triangular or

136
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,060
pyramidal shape that's
very characteristic of

137
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,120
the neurons in the
neocortex and then we

138
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,420
have some other small
cells stained here. The

139
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:21,630
big cells, we'll
learn more about this

140
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:23,740
throughout the semester,
are the neurons, and

141
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:26,860
the small cells are the
glial cells, all right?

142
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,240
We're going to
continue the discussion

143
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,520
here in the next couple
slides with neurons.

144
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:36,220
All right, so neurons
have dendrites,

145
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:36,900
right?

146
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:42,220
More sophisticated
staining techniques allowed

147
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:47,520
for visualization of
the full morphology

148
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,710
of neurons. And the
early anatomists noticed

149
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:56,700
how complex neurons
could be in their

150
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,630
morphology in different
parts of the brain. And

151
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:02,540
you have already talked
a little bit about

152
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:08,580
the dorsal root ganglion
neurons of the, of

153
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:12,800
the periphery, right?
And you might have

154
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,480
learned about how they
have a cell body in the

155
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,470
dorsal root ganglia.
They have peripheral

156
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,520
terminals that, let's
say, are going to the

157
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,560
skin, and then they
have terminals that go

158
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,580
to the CNS, like the
spinal cord right notice

159
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,940
here many different
other kinds of cells in

160
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,520
different parts of
the brain like the

161
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:42,660
neocortex here the
hippocampus in the olfactory

162
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:46,300
areas in the cerebellum
and in blue we're

163
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:50,220
showing the dendrites
so the dendrites are the

164
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:54,360
information receiving
part of the neuron

165
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,000
so when two people have
a conversation right

166
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,990
if we want to think of
this analogy it's that

167
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:03,140
it's the ears of both
of those people that

168
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,720
receive the information
from the other in

169
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,500
that conversation right
so they're kind of

170
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,800
like the the ears or
the hearing part of the

171
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,300
conversation between
two or more neurons

172
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:17,420
right and look how
elaborate some of the

173
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:20,160
dendrites of different
cells and different parts

174
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,620
of the brain can be So
this is the Purkinje

175
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:26,560
cell dendrites of cells
in the cerebellum,

176
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,220
right,

177
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:30,880
what I've circled there
in red. And so you'll

178
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,960
see how this architecture
of the dendrites

179
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:39,680
allows for many, many
thousands of neurons

180
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,240
to communicate with
this cell, right? So

181
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,920
it has many ears for all
kinds of conversations

182
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:52,280
with other cells.
So those that are a

183
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:56,760
little summary of the
dendrites of neurons

184
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,860
if we

185
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:01,420
zoom in even

186
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:04,640
further on to dendrites,
so here we have a

187
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,560
Pyramidal cell of
the neocortex and

188
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:13,240
we see all the
dendrites in green here

189
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:16,640
This this one guy
down here might be the

190
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,060
axon. So let's exclude
that guy but everything

191
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:21,400
else you see in green
are the dendrites.

192
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,140
And if we zoom in
on one segment here,

193
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:28,680
we zoom in on this
box and magnify

194
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,580
it, and now I
hope you can

195
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:33,090
see all these
little appendages,

196
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,070
little tiny
little protrusions

197
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:39,600
coming off of
the dendrite.

198
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,220
If you take a cross
-section through

199
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:46,620
this, you'll see these
protrusions here.

200
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,020
And so these are
what's called as

201
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:54,860
dendritic spines
and here this is the

202
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,720
Dendrite itself.
These are

203
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,520
dendritic spines
and these are areas

204
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,060
where where

205
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,360
neurons
preferentially make

206
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,160
their connections, right?

207
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,720
Not all neurons have

208
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,520
spines, but those that do

209
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:19,320
this is an area of of
exceptional connect

210
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,620
connectivity, synaptic
connectivity. We'll

211
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:25,480
talk about synapses
in a second. And we're

212
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,900
beginning to learn
a lot more about

213
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,400
dendritic spines, their
biology, and how they

214
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,480
might correlate to
disease. The whole point

215
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,200
of what I'll try to
show in this lecture

216
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,000
is how the understanding,
the histology,

217
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,860
understanding the
different cell

218
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:46,200
types in the brain,
you know, correlate

219
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,660
to our understanding
of brain

220
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,640
function and brain
disease, okay?

221
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,580
So, for example,

222
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:57,940
the children with
Fragile X syndrome,

223
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,880
when they've done
histology on the brain of

224
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,720
those children, and
remember, Fragile X

225
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,180
syndrome is caused by
mutations of the fmrp

226
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:11,220
gene what you observe
is that their neurons

227
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:15,820
have increased numbers
of dendritic spines

228
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:19,860
on the neocortical
dendrites right so we

229
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:23,760
now know that the fmrp
gene encodes a protein

230
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,240
that's important for
the homeostasis of

231
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,420
dendritic spines and
dendritic spines are

232
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:34,300
going to determine
the connectivity, the

233
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,160
conversations that
neurons can have in these

234
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,500
networks important for
everything that we do,

235
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,780
right, our behavior.
And we know that one

236
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:45,200
of the major symptoms
of Fragile X syndrome,

237
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,740
right, is cognitive
disability, right? And

238
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:53,220
some of that cognitive
disability manifests

239
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:56,140
from the fact that
these neurons are not

240
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:59,380
connected appropriately
because there is an

241
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:02,180
overabundance of
dendritic spines, right?

242
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,660
On the other hand,
when you look

243
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:07,180
at dendritic spines
in the brains

244
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,960
of patients with
schizophrenia,

245
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:13,280
like you see here,
the schizophrenic

246
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:18,160
dendrites have impoverished
spines compared to

247
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,500
a control patient,
right? And we know

248
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:25,320
schizophrenia has its own
distinct characteristic

249
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,310
of behavioral
change, right? And

250
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:30,720
that has to come from
somewhere. That has to

251
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,540
come from changes
in connectivity and

252
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,260
changes in physiology.
So these are two good

253
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:40,560
examples of how, you
know, of things we

254
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,600
already know about
dendritic spines and

255
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,800
what's probably yet
to come in the future.

256
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,480
Okay, so we've covered
a little bit about

257
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,520
dendrites and dendritic
spines. Now it's time

258
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:59,660
to talk about the
axons. In the analogy I

259
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:02,360
gave of two people
having a conversation, we

260
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,580
said it's the ears of
those two people that

261
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:08,850
are kind of like the
dendrites that can hear

262
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:11,480
the information from
the other cell, from

263
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,660
the other person. Well,
think of the axon as

264
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:18,000
kind of the mouth of
the neuron right that

265
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,980
part of two people that
expresses information

266
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,680
from one from one person
to the other right

267
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,160
and we know in our in
our picture down here

268
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,880
that we have our
cell body right here

269
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:37,200
we have our dendrites
shown here and then

270
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,800
we have an axon
right and this axon

271
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,160
is going to make
connections with another

272
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,120
neuron or make
connections to a muscle,

273
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,440
or to a gland, or
to the eye, right?

274
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:54,380
And this is the
information sending portion

275
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:58,760
of the cell. There is
a special part of the

276
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,360
axon very close to
the cell body known as

277
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,080
the axon initial
segment, where there are

278
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,460
lots of ion channels
that we'll talk about in

279
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:12,940
the next lecture we have
the main axon itself

280
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,120
and then at the end
we have the terminal

281
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,160
region right the
presynaptic terminals where

282
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,100
this neuron makes
contact with muscle or

283
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:25,220
another cell note in
this picture here we

284
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:28,320
have the cell body and
dendrites of a motor

285
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:33,100
neuron and notice how
that axon has branches

286
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:38,060
right it's one axon
that then branches and

287
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,620
makes contact with
different parts of this

288
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,880
muscle all right so
you see that a lot it's

289
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,940
not just one it's one
axon but there could

290
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:49,720
be many branches that
come that emanate from

291
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,680
that axon to make to
have more conversations

292
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,680
with more more neurons
right so axons are

293
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,160
found in nearly all
neurons there might

294
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,180
there are some neurons in
the um in the periphery

295
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:04,840
and the sensory organs
that don't have,

296
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,060
you know, what you
might consider to be a

297
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:10,520
classic axon, but those
are the exceptions.

298
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,300
Axons can vary
widely in length,

299
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,680
shape, and number
of branches, right?

300
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:17,820
Axon terminals,
like I said, make

301
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,060
contact with other
neurons and muscles,

302
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,500
and these are, in
summary, again,

303
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,480
the communicating
wires of

304
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,980
the neurons that
do the talking.

305
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,540
Something very
interesting, very important

306
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:32,820
about axons, obviously,
is that in the axonal

307
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:36,000
injury is obviously
going to really disrupt

308
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,760
the communication of
that network, right?

309
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:43,600
And just so like spinal
cord injury obviously

310
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,380
is cutting the
connections between the

311
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:51,400
brain and the spinal
cord networks that then

312
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:54,780
communicate with
muscle, for example. But

313
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,960
something interesting is
that peripheral nervous

314
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:01,940
system axons, right,
can often regrow when

315
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:05,120
they're severed or
injured, right? And a

316
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,820
process known as
Wallerian degeneration

317
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:13,520
characterizes the process
of, you know, the injured

318
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,090
axon dying, parts of
it dying back, and

319
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:20,060
parts that can regrow.
So let's say if you

320
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:22,800
have some kind of injury
in this neuron here,

321
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,250
if you have some
kind of injury here,

322
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:30,860
Valerian degeneration
causes these parts

323
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:34,160
of the axon to die
back, and you will see

324
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:39,940
new growth of the
axon to make contact

325
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:42,740
with that, to re-innervate
that target again.

326
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:45,600
So this is why axons
are so important.

327
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:50,960
um i mentioned the axon
hillock right that's

328
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,820
shown right here the
axon hillock and in

329
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:57,180
yellow we see staining
for sodium channels

330
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:00,600
right we'll talk about
sodium channels and

331
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,080
potassium channels in
the axon hillock that

332
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:07,960
are important for the
electrical activity of

333
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,640
the neuron and the
the generation of the

334
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,980
action potential, right?
And we'll talk about

335
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,500
in a coming slide the

336
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,360
cells that
produce myelin,

337
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,280
shown here in purple,

338
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,440
right? These segments of

339
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:28,040
purple that are wrapped
around by myelin.

340
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,960
And notice how in
between these segments

341
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,580
we have this little
punctate staining of

342
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:42,420
sodium channels, right
these segments in

343
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:45,920
between myelinated
portions of the axon

344
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:50,800
are called the nodes
of Ranvier right the

345
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:54,660
nodes of Ranvier are
repeating segments

346
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,960
of localized density
of ion channels and

347
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,280
other proteins used
to regenerate the

348
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,620
action potential right
and increase the the

349
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:05,800
speed of that
electrical signal down

350
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:09,060
the length of the axon,
especially when the

351
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:13,420
axon is very long
to reach its target.

352
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:17,260
And the node of
Ranvier, by definition,

353
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:20,160
are found in between
segments of myelin.

354
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,900
So there's a lot of
interesting biology

355
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:27,280
going on about
myelination and and

356
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,460
proteins at the nodes
of Ranvier. Something

357
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:35,350
very interesting for
you all to reflect

358
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:42,280
on is how there is
now evidence that

359
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,840
intellectual disability
and symptoms like

360
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:49,180
autism come from
dysfunction of the nodes

361
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:52,740
of Ranvier biology.
Okay, so CATNAP2,

362
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:57,020
C-N-T-N-A-P-2, sometimes
known as CATNAP,

363
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,740
encodes a gene that
is found in the

364
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:04,500
nodes of Ranvier
and important for

365
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:08,140
clustering of ion
channels at these nodes.

366
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:12,980
and mutations in
CATNAP2 gene cause

367
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:16,000
Pitt-Hopkins syndrome.
And Pitt-Hopkins

368
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,420
syndrome has an
interesting phenotype

369
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:22,640
of autism, speech
and language delay,

370
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:25,220
intellectual disability,
and epilepsy.

371
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:29,160
So here we have pretty
good evidence of how

372
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:33,660
important it is that
neuronal axons organize

373
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,960
all of the different
proteins at the

374
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:40,710
nodes of Ranvier to
allow for the right

375
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:44,900
propagation of electrical
signals down the axon.

376
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:50,800
All right and let's
zoom in now on a very

377
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,860
important part of
the axon known as the

378
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:58,660
axon terminal right
where you know chemical

379
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,880
synapses or
connections chemical

380
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,020
connections are made
between neurons and

381
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,620
muscle or neurons and
other neurons, right?

382
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:11,040
So we're zooming in
on this axon here

383
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:16,200
right at the end where
this axon terminal,

384
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,660
right, is making a
connection with the

385
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:24,060
postsynaptic dendrite
of another neuron. So we

386
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,620
call the neuron that's
doing the talking the

387
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:30,180
presynaptic neuron.
So this neuron here is

388
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:32,740
the presynaptic
neuron. And we call the

389
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:35,160
neuron that's doing
the listening here with

390
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:39,100
its dendrite as the
postsynaptic neuron,

391
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,900
presynaptic and postsynaptic,
right? So here we

392
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:47,420
see the presynaptic
axon terminal, and we

393
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:50,890
see these vesicles
here. These are vesicles

394
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:57,000
that have the chemical
messenger that makes

395
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,140
up the language of
neuronal communication.

396
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,900
right? And so,
again, here's our

397
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,220
presynaptic neuron, our
postsynaptic neuron,

398
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:09,280
and very often what
you see is that

399
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,060
the presynaptic
neuron's axon makes

400
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,940
contact with the
dendrite or the

401
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:18,780
dendritic spine of
the postsynaptic cell.

402
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:23,480
If we look at an EM
image of a presynaptic,

403
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,390
of a synapse, of a
chemical synapse.

404
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:30,920
Here we see the
presynaptic axon terminal

405
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:34,320
membrane. We see
some vesicles here.

406
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,900
Here we see the
postsynaptic dendritic or

407
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,740
spine membrane.
And then notice how

408
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:43,180
there's this little
space in between, right?

409
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:46,840
So that is known as
the synaptic cleft.

410
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,520
And then we will
talk about how

411
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,920
there's release of
transmitter to send

412
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,520
that communication
from the pre to the

413
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,660
postsynaptic cell.

414
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,760
So this is the
most common

415
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,070
type of synapse
that you see or

416
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,240
contact you see
in the brain.

417
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,370
Kind of the connection
from axon terminal

418
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:10,100
to another kind of
to another neuron.

419
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:14,440
And it is pretty
fast on the order of

420
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,000
one to five milliseconds
and throughout

421
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,060
this block you're
going to talk about

422
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:23,120
so many disorders
and syndromes right

423
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,680
and the goal here
is that when you're

424
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,020
learning new things
about brain disease

425
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:32,020
that you're able
to connect that to

426
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:35,220
the cell types to
their type their

427
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,260
parts of different
parts of the cell

428
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,380
how they're
interconnected and how

429
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:42,280
they they communicate
with each other

430
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,520
All right, here
are just a little

431
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,380
more pictures showing
synaptic communication

432
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:53,500
caught in the
act. So here we

433
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,940
have our presynaptic
axon terminal,

434
00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:00,370
pre, and here we
have our postsynaptic

435
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:02,320
dendrite. Here we
have a dendritic

436
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,380
spine. Here's
another axon here.

437
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,750
I'll label that
with X for axon.

438
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:13,000
All these different
connections being received

439
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,600
by this dendrite
and this spine. And

440
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,580
notice here we have this
omega-shaped structure

441
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:24,400
here, which is a
presynaptic vesicle, right,

442
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,240
releasing its contents
at the synapse.

443
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,800
And here we have another
beautiful image again.

444
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:36,560
We have our presynaptic
vesicles here that

445
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:40,940
are fusing to exocytose
to release the

446
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:43,940
contents of that
transmitter. so really cool

447
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:48,160
and it's amazing that we
now have um microscopy

448
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,720
and tools to understand
more about how

449
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,640
neurons connect and how
they communicate all

450
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:02,540
right so there are
all kinds of different

451
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:05,460
flavors of this kind
of uh communication

452
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:08,580
these kinds of chemical
synapses where you have

453
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:11,860
axon to dendrite you
you can also have

454
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:15,160
ax so here's that
picture axon to dendrite

455
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:19,140
we have pre here on
this on the left-hand

456
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:22,440
side of this picture,
and here we have post.

457
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,500
Forgive the sloppy
handwriting.

458
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:30,540
And for the most part,
you'll see axon-to

459
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:32,820
-dendrite connections,
but you can also

460
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:35,920
have axon-to-cell-body
connection or axon

461
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:39,600
-to-soma, and you can
also have axon-to-axon

462
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,380
connections, but these
are somewhat rare

463
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:46,100
in, let's say, the
brain, a little more

464
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:49,860
common in the spinal
cord, all right? And

465
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:52,020
here another nice
lower magnification

466
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:55,300
picture of a postsynaptic
neuron labeled in

467
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:58,920
brown and we have
the presynaptic axons

468
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,060
targeting different
parts of the cell here

469
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:03,700
in black. So the
presynaptic axon in

470
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,940
black and the postsynaptic
neuron in brown.

471
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:13,000
And again And just
big picture, if we

472
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
understood all of the
kinds of connections from

473
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,920
all of the neurons in
the brain, then we would

474
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,240
solve the mystery of
how the brain works

475
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:25,400
and what goes wrong
in brain disease. And

476
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,120
so the major challenge
has been really

477
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:32,140
understanding and having
the map of all the kinds

478
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:35,320
of connections that
exist in the brain for

479
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:39,540
the different functions
that the brain allows

480
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:42,320
and nervous system
allows us to perform.

481
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,700
All right, another
kind of connection

482
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,420
that you see that's
different than the

483
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:51,200
one we just described,
the chemical-type

484
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,830
synapse, where an
axon releases a

485
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:57,100
transmitter on a
dendrite or a cell body

486
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:01,480
or an axon is a type
of connection known

487
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:05,000
as the electrical
synapse. Where's my

488
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,780
pointer here? The
electrical synapse.

489
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,720
Right?

490
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,660
Or also the electrical
synapse, yeah.

491
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,780
These, think of these
kinds of synapses like

492
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:25,520
two hands clasping
each other. but when

493
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,340
these two hands connect
let's say very often

494
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:32,140
you'll see electrical
synapses made by two

495
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:36,500
neurons at the at their
dendrites right these

496
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:39,840
two hands connect uh
holding on to each

497
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,660
other also have ion
channels that connect

498
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:48,960
the insides of the
cell to one another so

499
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,550
that's what you see
here if we zoom in even

500
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:55,640
further at this electrical
synapse we can see

501
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:00,700
two sets of channels
right neuron one and

502
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:05,400
neuron two both have one
set of these channels

503
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,760
known as gap junctions
or connections

504
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:13,360
made up of the connection
proteins right on

505
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,990
each side each cell
has its has its own

506
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:21,700
connection that line up,
right, that line up and

507
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:28,220
then create a pore
through which different

508
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:32,860
ions and low molecular
weight proteins can

509
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:35,640
move through, right?
And so this is a way

510
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,840
for one neuron to
communicate with the other

511
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:44,500
neuron, again, via
exchange of chemical

512
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:48,060
and ionic information,
right? We'll talk about

513
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,000
the physiology of these
kinds of synapses.

514
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,880
For now, what's
important is that you

515
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:55,520
appreciate the anatomy
of the histology of this

516
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,440
kind of synapse, known
as the electrical

517
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,480
synapse or the gap
junctions. You'll learn

518
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,080
about gap junctions in
other organ systems.

519
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,940
And we'll talk about
gap junctions in other

520
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,420
cell types in the
brain. Here we're

521
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:10,400
talking about gap
junctions connecting two

522
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:14,230
neurons to each other.
And if we take an EM

523
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:17,220
slice, if we take a
slice through here and

524
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:20,920
look at it in the
EM, here we see one

525
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:25,820
dendrite and the dendrite
of the other cell.

526
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:31,100
And we see the
electrical synapse that

527
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,320
they're making to one
another. There are

528
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:37,940
many different kinds
of these connexin

529
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:44,180
proteins made throughout
the body and many

530
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:48,280
different genes
encoding different types

531
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,660
of connexins that then
make gap junctions.

532
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:53,160
There are gap
junctions throughout

533
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,380
the body in many
different organ systems.

534
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:59,060
And there are about
30 diseases known

535
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:05,860
to be caused by
connexin gene mutations.

536
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,360
And you'll probably
cover some of those

537
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,400
this block, but that's
as much as I'll say

538
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:15,120
about that right now.
so we can move on and

539
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:22,100
not get too caught
up on small details.

540
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:27,580
All right, so I mentioned
how gap junctions

541
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:31,040
allow for intracellular
connections,

542
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,980
right? So what I'm
showing here in this

543
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:38,500
slide is an example
where this neuron here

544
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:44,460
was pierced with a
micropipette, a tiny glass

545
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:48,500
pipette containing a
dye, right? And notice

546
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:52,500
how after injecting
this one cell with the

547
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:58,200
dye, you can see many
other neurons that

548
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:02,620
also are dye labeled
within a certain radius

549
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:07,080
of this injected cell,
right? So this is

550
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:10,280
because this neuron
that was injected, right

551
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:13,560
here in the yellow arrow,
this neuron has gap

552
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:16,880
junctions or makes
electrical synapses with

553
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,420
all of these other
neurons in this radius,

554
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:24,620
right? So this is an
example of how something

555
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,760
going on in one cell,
in this case the

556
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,920
dye filling the neuron,
can be communicated

557
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:35,020
to the other cells via
these gap junctions.

558
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:37,740
Here's an example
of a neuron that was

559
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:41,000
injected with a dye that
makes no gap junction

560
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,880
or no electrical
synapses with any other

561
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:47,160
cell, right? And that's
why we only see one,

562
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,660
okay? This little
thing over here is

563
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:52,380
not another cell.
It's a little piece

564
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,720
of the axon that has
been chopped off.

565
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:03,400
So one thing that's
important also to

566
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,300
mention is that gap
junctions are bidirectional,

567
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,720
meaning that,
like you saw, the

568
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:13,940
connexin allows ion
flow from cell 1 to

569
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:16,240
cell 2, as well as
from cell 2 to cell 1,

570
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,890
right? In that way,
it's bidirectional.

571
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,840
That's a little
different than

572
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,980
chemical synapses,
where we really have

573
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:25,160
information moving
from the axon of

574
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,270
the presynaptic
cell to the dendrite

575
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:29,380
of the postsynaptic
cell, right?

576
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:32,120
And this type of
neural communication is

577
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:35,000
very, very fast, less
than one millisecond

578
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,860
because we're talking
about ion flow

579
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:38,900
here, so that's really
fast, much faster

580
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:42,760
than release of
transmitter, transmitter

581
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,800
binding to the receptor
on the postsynaptic

582
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,040
neuron. That takes
more time, even

583
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,860
though that's still,
you know, fast on the

584
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:53,030
order of one, two,
three milliseconds.

585
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:59,540
All right, and the
last part of the

586
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:01,740
neuron, so this part
of the lecture has

587
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:04,280
been all about neurons
and the different

588
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:07,840
anatomy of neurons,
right? Dendrite,

589
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,940
axon, axon
-hillock, terminal.

590
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,700
We're kind of skipping
over cell body

591
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,580
because I know you've
covered a lot of

592
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:20,050
that in some of the early
parts of foundations

593
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:22,700
when you're just
talking about

594
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:26,860
basic, you know,
biochemistry or genetics.

595
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:33,700
and another important
part of the neuron

596
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:37,300
where there is
growing research and

597
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:41,520
growing information
coming out and information

598
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,460
that relates to
disease is the neuronal

599
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:49,100
cilia or psyllium
right So neurons

600
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:54,140
have a psyllium,
just like many other

601
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:56,980
cells in the body that
you'll learn about.

602
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:02,200
Neurons have one
psyllium that

603
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:06,740
generally comes out
from between the

604
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,740
cell body and the
dendrite. So here

605
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:10,980
you can see this
is the cell body.

606
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:13,640
And here we have the main

607
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,400
trunk of the dendrite.

608
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:20,880
and notice in red
here is the cilium of

609
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,800
this neuron here's the
cilium of this neuron

610
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,460
over here and i like
this cartoon that

611
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:32,700
shows kind of the
general morphology of the

612
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:35,200
neuron so we have
the cell body we have

613
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:39,180
the nucleus here ad stands
for apical dendrites

614
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:41,520
so this will just
continue and you know

615
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,100
remember our branching
dendrites and then

616
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:48,000
down here we have
the axon right and

617
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,940
notice in red we have
the psyllium if you if

618
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:57,040
you take em prepare
em material of the

619
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:03,700
brain you'll see the
psyllium here of neurons

620
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,440
and the reason this
is so important is

621
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:09,580
because there is a
growing number of diseases

622
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:15,200
where mutation of genes
that are important

623
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,180
for cilia development
cause different

624
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:21,740
clinical manifestations
depending on the

625
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:26,240
organ, okay? And one of
those genes affecting

626
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:32,940
brain function is
ALR13B. ALR13B causes

627
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:37,340
deficits in cilia
development in neurons.

628
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:41,580
where is my cilia
development in neurons

629
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:45,200
and manifests in a
syndrome called Joubert

630
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,940
syndrome, right,
that's characterized by

631
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:53,940
malformations of
midbrain and hindbrain

632
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:56,960
regions, causes
intellectual disability,

633
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,600
retinal dystrophy,

634
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:06,100
renal disease, and
other issues in

635
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,960
the periphery,
okay? So I hope this

636
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:13,080
is convincing
information that all

637
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:16,440
parts of the neuron
are important.

638
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:19,080
And we're learning
more and more

639
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:22,380
about how different
parts of the neuron

640
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,840
and dysfunction
of those parts or

641
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:27,540
genetic mutation
that then affects

642
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:30,660
development translates
into disease.

643
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:37,520
all right so that
pretty much wraps up our

644
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,720
discussion of neurons
and their morphology

645
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:44,660
and I want to make sure
that you guys think

646
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:48,580
about how all of these
different parts of

647
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:51,400
the neuron can play
different roles in how

648
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:55,240
the brain works normally
and where things can

649
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:59,920
go wrong in disease
um you'll learn in

650
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,600
upcoming lectures how
about different parts

651
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,680
of the brain and the
neurons that are located

652
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:10,000
in that particular
part you'll see that

653
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,740
there's so much diversity
in terms of neuron

654
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:17,780
biology throughout
the brain neurons can

655
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:21,200
vary in their
morphology right their

656
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,660
shape their dendritic
and axonal features,

657
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:25,280
whether they have
spines in the dendrites

658
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,580
or not. Obviously,
they're going to

659
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:32,160
vary in their
connectivity, right? Are

660
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,960
they motor or sensory?
Are they involved

661
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,940
in one particular
network for emotion or

662
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:43,920
cognition or, you
know, sleep-wake or

663
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,520
hunger, any of those
things? You'll learn

664
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:50,600
in upcoming lectures
about the neurotransmitter

665
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,200
profile, and
we'll talk in an

666
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,640
upcoming lectures about
neurons that release

667
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,240
glutamate and GABA
and acetylcholine.

668
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,720
There are many other
molecular markers

669
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:04,080
that distinguish
different neuron types,

670
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:08,520
and these molecules
play a role in how

671
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:13,260
these neurons carry
out their function.

672
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,120
And, of course,

673
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:19,500
different neurons exist
in different networks,

674
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,660
like I mentioned,
in the motor systems

675
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:24,280
or in the cerebellum,
in the amygdala, et

676
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,760
cetera. So a lot of
exciting things to come.

677
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,220
And in the
background, of course,

678
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:31,540
is this picture
that you have

679
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:33,540
in your mind
about, you know,

680
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,600
dendrites, axons,
terminals, ion channels,

681
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:41,180
and how all these
things come together.

682
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,640
all right so we're
going to switch gears

683
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,600
now and talk about
the other major cell

684
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,200
population in the
nervous system called the

685
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,900
glial cells the glial
cells are not neurons

686
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,060
they're they're called
glia and they're

687
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:58,480
you know supporting
cells and but they still

688
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,920
play a very you know
huge huge role in

689
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:06,020
brain health and brain
disease um what's

690
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:08,340
different about glia
is that we don't have

691
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:13,220
glia don't connect
to muscle right to to

692
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:15,280
contract the muscle
so in that sense they

693
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,140
they're not carrying
that kind of information

694
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:20,600
important for movement
right glia don't

695
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:24,680
connect um the glia
don't play the same role

696
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:27,820
in processing you know
photons of light in

697
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:30,680
the retina to tell us
about the visual world

698
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,900
right or glia don't
play the same role

699
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:37,200
in our skin to tell
us about uh mechanical

700
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:42,030
or chemical stimulation
of the skin, like a

701
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:45,500
bee stinging you, right,
or a mosquito biting

702
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:48,540
you. That's carried
by neurons. So that's

703
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:51,920
where, you know,
glial cells play a

704
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,380
different but still
very important role. The

705
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:57,220
major types of glia in
the nervous system are

706
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:00,820
the astrocytes, the
myelin producing cells,

707
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:02,780
the oligos and the
Schwann cells, and

708
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:06,380
then the microglia,
okay? Now astrocytes,

709
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:09,820
oligos and microglia
are connected to each

710
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:14,800
other in interesting ways
that we're just going

711
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,590
to scratch the surface
on in this course.

712
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,260
But they are interconnected,
and there are

713
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:25,240
some rules of
connectivity between them.

714
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:29,470
All right, let's start
with the astrocytes.

715
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:32,040
They are the
structural partners at

716
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:35,380
chemical synapse
capable of glutamate and

717
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:38,740
potassium ion uptake.
So what does that

718
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:40,880
mean? Take a look at
this neuron in black,

719
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:48,660
right, that is
receiving input on its

720
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:51,600
dendrites. Let's zoom
in here at a synapse.

721
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,900
So here's the dendrite
and the dendritic

722
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:57,460
spine of the neuron
in black, which is a

723
00:40:57,460 --> 00:41:00,260
post-synaptic neuron.
And then here in

724
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:03,980
the, I guess, greenish
color is an axon,

725
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:06,780
right? An axon making
a chemical synapse

726
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:10,060
right here. And in
white, you can see the

727
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:14,520
neurotransmitter
filled vesicles, right?

728
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,080
And what's important
is look at how

729
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:19,620
the astrocyte, the
pink astrocyte here,

730
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:23,400
look how it has a
process, process meaning

731
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,980
like, we don't say,
We don't use the

732
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:30,000
term dendrite for
astrocyte, you know,

733
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:33,000
extensions. We use
the term process. The

734
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,840
astrocyte process wraps
around the synapse,

735
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:41,140
right? And then, therefore,
making it, putting

736
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:45,180
it in a perfect position
to suck up extra

737
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:47,580
neurotransmitter that
might be released by the

738
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:49,660
presynaptic neuron,
right? Or regulating

739
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:55,000
ions, ion balance in
the extracellular space.

740
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:59,060
right look how this
astrocyte also makes

741
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:02,880
contact with this blood
vessel here and this

742
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,620
blood vessel here
right and if we zoom in

743
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:12,160
further you can see um
that in pink how this

744
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:15,380
axon has processes or
what they call as the

745
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:18,700
end feet that make can
make contact with the

746
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:22,300
with the um with the
vasculature So here

747
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:26,660
in black, we see some
astrocytes, and in brown,

748
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:30,720
we have a blood
vessel, and you can see

749
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:34,520
right here, if we zoom
in on this in box B,

750
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:38,110
you can see how this
astrocyte process

751
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:41,580
has end feet that
contact the blood

752
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:43,820
vessel. Here's another
example here, right?

753
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:48,180
So in this way,
astrocytes can detect

754
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:50,580
what's going on in
the vasculature.

755
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:57,120
let me show you this
neat movie of an

756
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:00,580
astrocyte that's
receiving information from

757
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:03,900
the blood vessel when
the vessel dilates,

758
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:08,400
right? So our astrocyte
is in green, and

759
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,100
whenever intracellular
calcium changes

760
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:13,080
in that astrocyte,
which means the neuron

761
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:15,380
is, excuse me, the
astrocyte is working,

762
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:19,140
is processing information,
you'll see the

763
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:21,840
intensity of the
green signal increase.

764
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:29,580
So, let me, that
was a little fast.

765
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:32,560
Let me go back.
Notice how here,

766
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,100
right around
here, is the blood

767
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:36,120
vessel is increasing
in diameter.

768
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:39,320
And now look at the
astrocyte end foot,

769
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:42,500
processing that
information,

770
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:49,220
right? And now this
astrocyte, we said,

771
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:52,280
you know, is now
receiving information

772
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,860
and it can communicate
this information

773
00:43:54,860 --> 00:44:00,740
about changes in
the hemodynamics.

774
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:07,840
And how can the astrocyte
communicate? Well,

775
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:10,580
via gap junctions.
So here we have an

776
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:13,220
astrocyte that's being
filled with a micropipette

777
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:15,860
and a fluorescent dye,
and look at all the

778
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:18,880
different astrocytes
surrounding that one

779
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,300
astrocyte that are also
filled with the dye,

780
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:24,140
right? So when this
astrocyte is active,

781
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:27,120
responding to something
in the environment

782
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:29,680
or blood vessel
hemodynamics, it

783
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:33,300
can communicate that
to other astrocytes,

784
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:35,000
right? And we're
still, you know,

785
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,580
learning, there's much
more to learn about

786
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:39,160
how astrocytes
communicate information

787
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:42,540
in the healthy and
in diseased brain.

788
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,360
Astrocytes also respond

789
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:49,340
to injury by trying to,

790
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:55,880
you know, make a scar
or reorganize the

791
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:59,660
structural integrity of
the tissue in response

792
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:01,660
to, let's say,
mechanical injury, right?

793
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:06,180
or a hypoxic event
that ends up killing

794
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:09,180
a lot of neurons,
right? And so this is

795
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:13,000
the kind of astrocyte
histology you'll see

796
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,860
in the healthy brain.
And then notice how,

797
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:19,790
in response to injury,
you get a change in

798
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:24,560
the morphology of the
astrocyte. And here

799
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,660
we're seeing the
formation of a glial scar

800
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:30,280
due to some kind of
penetrating injury.

801
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:32,560
Look at how much
darker the staining

802
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,140
is. And the staining
here is for GFAP,

803
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:38,620
which stands for glial

804
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:40,800
fibrillary
acidic protein,

805
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:44,260
right? This is a
marker, is a molecular

806
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:48,340
marker and gold standard
for reactive astrocytes.

807
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:50,600
Reactive astrocytes,
meaning astrocytes

808
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:54,400
that are now undergoing
a job of trying

809
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,880
to respond to injury
to help the brain

810
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:03,760
recover, right? and
reactive astrocytes and

811
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,620
GFAP is a marker for
reactive astrocytes

812
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:10,640
and gliosis that you
will see in brain injury

813
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:15,450
and other types of
brain diseases and

814
00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:19,340
GFAP is a marker used
to identify tumors made

815
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:23,080
up of astrocytes
known as astrocytomas.

816
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:27,540
We talked a little bit
about how all these

817
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:29,660
different glia kind of
communicate with one

818
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:32,340
another and can
interconnect well mutations

819
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:36,540
in gfap cause a disease
known as alexander

820
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:39,400
disease leukodystrophy
right which is

821
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:42,820
characterized by changes
in white matter right

822
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:47,460
or axon my myelination
important for axon

823
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:51,320
function okay and
these affected children

824
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:55,220
have white matter
disruption, white matter

825
00:46:55,290 --> 00:46:58,040
deficits, and they have
cognitive and motor

826
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:00,200
delays and loss of
motor control. So we

827
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:02,020
see how important
astrocytes are in many

828
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:04,960
different aspects of
brain health and disease.

829
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,900
Microglia, let's move
from astrocytes to

830
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:14,870
microglia. These are
the immune cells of the

831
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:17,470
nervous system. They're
capable of phagocytosis

832
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:21,730
of cell debris or a
microbial invader right

833
00:47:21,730 --> 00:47:25,410
they can release
cytokines and also trigger

834
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:28,730
inflammation right
they change shape in

835
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:31,070
response to injury
infection or inflammation

836
00:47:31,070 --> 00:47:34,050
so this is what a healthy
microglia will look

837
00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:37,850
like but at what it
will transition to this

838
00:47:37,850 --> 00:47:41,630
these different shapes
and when it and and

839
00:47:41,630 --> 00:47:43,590
this kind of shape here
is very characteristic

840
00:47:43,590 --> 00:47:47,250
of uh peripheral or
peripheral macrophages

841
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:48,930
and this is the kind
of shape that you'll

842
00:47:48,930 --> 00:47:53,670
see when a microglia
is going to phagocytose

843
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:57,390
cell debris or a
microbe. Check out

844
00:47:57,390 --> 00:48:01,730
this video of
microglia labeled in

845
00:48:01,730 --> 00:48:04,910
green responding
to chemical injury

846
00:48:04,910 --> 00:48:07,390
here in this micro
pipette, right?

847
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:13,050
So you can see the
processes of the

848
00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:16,070
microglia coming to
investigate what's

849
00:48:16,070 --> 00:48:18,750
going on, what's
happening there.

850
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:22,230
It's amazing, right?
So these are the

851
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:25,370
microglia are the
kind of immune cells

852
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:30,570
of the nervous system.

853
00:48:30,890 --> 00:48:34,230
Check out this
video of a dying

854
00:48:34,230 --> 00:48:37,770
neuron in red. So we
can watch the video

855
00:48:37,770 --> 00:48:40,050
of the neuron
dying here in red,

856
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:41,810
right? You see its cell

857
00:48:41,810 --> 00:48:43,510
body basically
disappearing.

858
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:47,650
But when we also image
the microglia at the

859
00:48:47,650 --> 00:48:50,650
same time you can see
in green the microglia

860
00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:53,180
in green you can see
that the microglia

861
00:48:56,510 --> 00:48:58,730
identifies the
dying neuron

862
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:05,810
and comes and
swallows it up right

863
00:49:05,810 --> 00:49:07,710
hopefully can
you see how now

864
00:49:08,470 --> 00:49:12,550
the microglia has
the red cell body

865
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:15,230
inside of it, right?
And so this is

866
00:49:15,230 --> 00:49:19,800
how microglia do
their job, okay?

867
00:49:24,450 --> 00:49:29,450
I have one more
video of the brain

868
00:49:29,450 --> 00:49:32,210
being injured here,
but with a laser,

869
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:36,580
right? and you'll
start and you'll see a

870
00:49:36,970 --> 00:49:40,690
microglial cell coming
to investigate what's

871
00:49:40,690 --> 00:49:46,510
going on is there a
foreign invader do we need

872
00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:50,930
to phagocytose something
so it's incredible

873
00:49:51,110 --> 00:49:55,290
and we're learning more
about how microglia

874
00:49:55,290 --> 00:49:59,310
play a role in disease
and brain health.

875
00:50:00,830 --> 00:50:07,390
Let's move from
microglia to the myelin

876
00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:10,310
-producing cells
of the brain, of

877
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:12,090
the nervous system,
which are the

878
00:50:12,090 --> 00:50:14,290
oligodendrocytes and
the Schwann cells.

879
00:50:14,690 --> 00:50:20,350
So the oligos
produce myelin in the

880
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:21,770
central nervous
system, whereas the

881
00:50:21,770 --> 00:50:23,450
Schwann cells produce
myelin for the

882
00:50:23,450 --> 00:50:25,730
peripheral nervous
system, right? Oligos

883
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:27,530
can envelop more
than one axon, but

884
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:30,370
Schwann cells envelop
only one axon.

885
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:36,770
And both cell types
obviously play a role

886
00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:39,030
in diseases where you
have demyelination

887
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:42,010
or dysmyelination,
right? Like multiple

888
00:50:42,010 --> 00:50:44,470
sclerosis. And what's
interesting about

889
00:50:44,470 --> 00:50:47,770
oligodendrocytes is that
they're continuously

890
00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:51,210
produced in the brain
as are astrocytes

891
00:50:51,210 --> 00:50:53,030
and microglia, if I
didn't mention that.

892
00:50:53,030 --> 00:50:55,130
Astrocytes, microglia,
and oligos are

893
00:50:55,130 --> 00:50:58,750
continuously produced
in the brain and in

894
00:50:58,750 --> 00:51:01,330
the nervous system.
And that's how you can

895
00:51:01,330 --> 00:51:04,830
have diseases where
you have, you know,

896
00:51:05,050 --> 00:51:08,810
demyelination and
remyelination, you know,

897
00:51:08,810 --> 00:51:11,570
as characteristic of
that of that disease

898
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:16,690
phenotype and so what
we see here is in this

899
00:51:16,690 --> 00:51:19,930
in this image here we
have the dark staining

900
00:51:19,930 --> 00:51:23,150
which is for myelin
or you can see how

901
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:27,540
much myelin is in is in
the brain and in this

902
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:30,290
cartoon here of the
spinal cord we have a

903
00:51:30,290 --> 00:51:34,230
motor neuron whose axon
is being myelinated

904
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:37,630
by an oligodendrocyte
while it's still in

905
00:51:37,630 --> 00:51:42,230
the cord and then as
the axon exits the cord

906
00:51:42,230 --> 00:51:45,070
now in the periphery
part of that axon is

907
00:51:45,070 --> 00:51:47,590
now myelinated by the
Schwann cells right

908
00:51:55,130 --> 00:51:58,410
so obviously we
talked about the four

909
00:51:58,410 --> 00:52:01,950
myelin and the nodes
in between segments of

910
00:52:01,950 --> 00:52:05,030
myelin known as the
nodes of Ranvier

911
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:09,850
right and we're learning
There's so much to

912
00:52:09,850 --> 00:52:12,970
learn about oligos
and Schwann cells as

913
00:52:12,970 --> 00:52:16,210
it relates to disease
and demyelination.

914
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:20,790
And something interesting
that is emerging

915
00:52:20,790 --> 00:52:24,070
is the autoimmune
disorders where

916
00:52:24,070 --> 00:52:27,270
patients develop
autoantibodies against

917
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:30,750
myelin proteins,
right? Like MOG is

918
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:33,410
myelin oligodendrocyte
glycoprotein. And

919
00:52:33,410 --> 00:52:36,110
patients with
antibodies against this

920
00:52:36,110 --> 00:52:38,150
protein are going to
have demyelination.

921
00:52:38,390 --> 00:52:45,530
And that disorder is
known as MOGAD or MOG

922
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:48,570
antibody disorder. And
you have inflammation,

923
00:52:48,570 --> 00:52:51,250
you have
demyelination, you have

924
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:55,330
optic neuritis,
transverse myelitis, and

925
00:52:55,330 --> 00:52:58,410
other problems in
the periphery, right?

926
00:52:58,410 --> 00:53:03,010
Because axons and the
myelin found on those

927
00:53:03,010 --> 00:53:05,370
axons are so important
in so many different

928
00:53:05,370 --> 00:53:10,310
aspects of our health
and our behavior.

929
00:53:13,510 --> 00:53:18,610
And Olig2 is a marker
for oligodendrocytes.

930
00:53:18,870 --> 00:53:20,910
And there is a
type of neoplasm

931
00:53:20,910 --> 00:53:24,510
known as
oligodendroglioma, right?

932
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:26,970
And Olig2 is a marker

933
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:30,330
for that kind of tumor.

934
00:53:30,330 --> 00:53:32,630
And people with that
tumor, depending on

935
00:53:32,630 --> 00:53:34,150
where it is, can
present with all kinds

936
00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:36,090
of different symptoms,
headache, weakness,

937
00:53:36,090 --> 00:53:38,670
seizures, et cetera.
So I mentioned this

938
00:53:38,670 --> 00:53:41,230
again as understanding
the histology of

939
00:53:41,230 --> 00:53:43,190
the brain, understanding
markers that

940
00:53:43,190 --> 00:53:45,250
distinguish one cell
type from the other,

941
00:53:45,250 --> 00:53:49,010
understanding different
parts of all the cells

942
00:53:49,010 --> 00:53:51,530
in the nervous system,
help us understand

943
00:53:51,530 --> 00:53:53,970
the healthy brain
and diseased brain.

944
00:53:56,140 --> 00:53:58,350
All right, so
there are plenty of

945
00:53:58,350 --> 00:54:02,030
other non-neuronal
and non-glial cells

946
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:04,650
in the nervous
system, particularly

947
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:06,970
as they relate to
the vasculature.

948
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:09,110
Obviously, you have
endothelial cells

949
00:54:09,110 --> 00:54:10,910
that make up the blood
vessels. You have

950
00:54:10,910 --> 00:54:12,550
smooth muscle cells.
They're important

951
00:54:12,550 --> 00:54:15,610
in vasomotion,
vasodilation,

952
00:54:15,610 --> 00:54:18,250
vasoconstriction. And
there are also interesting

953
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:21,550
cells known as
pericytes that are

954
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:25,490
also in contact with
the vasculature,

955
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:27,910
right? And all these
cells can communicate

956
00:54:27,910 --> 00:54:30,790
with other glial
cell types as well.

957
00:54:31,030 --> 00:54:34,970
So this is an
amazing picture of

958
00:54:38,550 --> 00:54:45,470
pericytes and of cells
associated with the

959
00:54:45,470 --> 00:54:47,850
vasculature,
right? Here you see

960
00:54:47,850 --> 00:54:49,570
they're slightly
different depending on

961
00:54:49,570 --> 00:54:52,010
if you're in a venule
or an arterial,

962
00:54:52,230 --> 00:54:54,070
right? The smooth
muscle cells of the

963
00:54:54,070 --> 00:54:56,990
arterial have our
kind of wrap around

964
00:54:56,990 --> 00:54:59,590
like a band, right?
And obviously we know

965
00:54:59,590 --> 00:55:02,250
the arteries are
capable of vasomotion,

966
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:05,070
right? And the
venules not really.

967
00:55:05,410 --> 00:55:10,890
So we see how these
cells can produce that

968
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:14,610
vascular physiology.
and I have a neat

969
00:55:14,610 --> 00:55:19,970
little video here of a
smooth muscle cell as

970
00:55:21,330 --> 00:55:27,370
it participates in
vasoconstriction, right?

971
00:55:27,370 --> 00:55:30,030
So the vessel dilates
in red is the vessel

972
00:55:30,030 --> 00:55:34,550
and in green we have
the smooth muscle

973
00:55:34,550 --> 00:55:39,030
cell and you can see
changes in fluorescence

974
00:55:40,650 --> 00:55:43,090
over here in
the green alone

975
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:46,830
that correspond to

976
00:55:46,830 --> 00:55:48,670
changes in the
vasomotion,

977
00:55:49,310 --> 00:55:53,990
right? So many
different aspects of

978
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:59,070
brain function need
to be considered,

979
00:55:59,070 --> 00:56:01,710
right, when trying
to understand how the

980
00:56:01,710 --> 00:56:03,550
brain works and how
it affects disease.

981
00:56:03,570 --> 00:56:08,870
All right. And there
are even another set of

982
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:11,310
cells in the nervous
system that need to

983
00:56:11,310 --> 00:56:13,470
be discussed. These
are associated with

984
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:19,790
barriers, such as the
barrier cells that line the

985
00:56:19,790 --> 00:56:23,490
ventricles, or the
cells that are present

986
00:56:23,490 --> 00:56:27,030
inside the ventricles
that help produce

987
00:56:27,030 --> 00:56:30,890
cerebral spinal fluid.
And all these cells will

988
00:56:30,890 --> 00:56:33,210
be discussed in an
upcoming lecture on the

989
00:56:33,210 --> 00:56:36,270
blood-brain barrier and
the meninges, right,

990
00:56:36,270 --> 00:56:40,490
which are the
covering layers that's

991
00:56:40,490 --> 00:56:43,810
surrounding the brain
in between the nervous

992
00:56:43,810 --> 00:56:46,670
system and, let's say,
the skull, for example.

993
00:56:47,690 --> 00:56:48,830
All right.

994
00:56:49,230 --> 00:56:52,450
So let's put it kind
of all together that,

995
00:56:52,450 --> 00:56:54,490
you know, in the
background, we obviously

996
00:56:54,490 --> 00:56:56,890
understand the brain
controls behavior via

997
00:56:56,890 --> 00:57:00,590
the activity of
interconnected brain cells.

998
00:57:00,590 --> 00:57:02,170
And I'm going to change
this next year to

999
00:57:02,170 --> 00:57:04,550
say the nervous system
controls behavior,

1000
00:57:04,550 --> 00:57:06,730
not just brain, but
we need to consider

1001
00:57:06,730 --> 00:57:09,890
central and peripheral,
right? There exist

1002
00:57:09,890 --> 00:57:14,430
diverse cell types in
the nervous system and

1003
00:57:15,330 --> 00:57:17,390
neurons, glia, et
cetera, with different

1004
00:57:17,390 --> 00:57:19,930
functions, different
morphologies, et cetera.

1005
00:57:20,190 --> 00:57:22,270
And understanding
these will help us

1006
00:57:22,270 --> 00:57:25,850
understand the healthy
and diseased brain.

1007
00:57:28,630 --> 00:57:30,470
Please give me some

1008
00:57:30,470 --> 00:57:31,950
feedback on this lecture.

1009
00:57:32,650 --> 00:57:34,870

chance, click on that

1010
00:57:34,870 --> 00:57:38,470
link, and I welcome
all the feedback.

1011
00:57:38,470 --> 00:57:40,770
Please reach out to
me with any questions

1012
00:57:40,770 --> 00:57:43,790
that you might have,
and I look forward

1013
00:57:43,790 --> 00:57:48,190
to the next lecture
where we meet again.
