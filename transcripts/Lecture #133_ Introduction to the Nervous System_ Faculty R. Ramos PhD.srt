Cortex 2013)
Parts of NEURONS: Dendrites & dendritic spines
•Estomih Mtui MD, Gregory Gruener MD, 
MBA and Peter Dockery BSc, PhD Fitzgerald's 
Clinical Neuroanatomy and Neuroscience, 6, 63-74
Clinical correlate:
Dendritic spines are decreased in 
neocortical neurons of patients 
w/ schizophrenia.
Mechanisms still unknown.
Clinical correlate:
FMRP gene - that causes Fragile X syndrome-  is important in 
dendritic spine development.
Patients with Fragile X syndrome have increased numbers of 
 spines on neocortical neuron dendrites.

Parts of a NEURON: Axon, branches,  terminals 
- axons found on nearly all neurons 
- axons can vary widely in length, shape, and number of 
branches (emanating from axon initial segment/hillock).
- axon terminals make “contact” with other neurons or 
muscle and form synapses
- communicating “wires” of neurons that do the “talking”
Ch.5, Essential Neuroscience 2nd ed. Wolters Kluwer/Lippincott Williams
7
Axon initial segment (hillock) – area with large 
numbers of ion channels to initiate the action potential
Clinical correlate:
Severed or injured axons of neurons in the PNS 
can often grow back. Wallerian degeneration is 
the process of degenerating of axon distal to 
injury.

Axons:  Nodes of Ranvier
repeating segments of localized density of Na+/K+ channels 
and other proteins used to regenerate action potentials and 
increase conduction speed and fidelity down the length of the 
axon. Found in-between segments of myelin.
Clinical correlate:
CNTNAP2 gene encodes for a protein that is highly localized at 
the nodes of Ranvier and involved in clustering of K+ channels 
at the node. Gene mutations causes Pitt-Hopkins syndrome. 
Clinical features of Pitt-Hopkins syndrome includes:
autism, speech language delay, intellectual disability, epilepsy.

Axon terminal (terminal bouton) forms the chemical 
synapse!
- site where neurons functionally communicate with one 
another via neurotransmitter release.
- Most common type of synapse
- Slower form of neural communication but still pretty fast ~1-5ms
Axon
Dendrite
Presynaptic neuron – sending info/message
Postsynaptic neuron – receiving message
Clinical correlates – so many!
-neuro/psych disorders
-drugs of abuse/addiction
-sleep/wake, hunger/satiety
-SHANK3 mutations & autism

Electrical synapses:
 Gap junctions/Connexons
12
Neurons are “connected” to one another at the synapse
- the site where neurons functionally communicate with one another
Gap junctions allow direct ion & small 
molecule flow from one neuron to the 
other. Usually bidirectional.
Clinical correlate:
Certain connexins expressed in specific cell types. 
~30 disease due to connexin gene mutations. •E Mtui MD, G Gruener MD, MBA and P Dockery BSc, PhD  Fitzgerald's

Gap junctions & Electrical synapses in neurons
13
- Gap junctions allow direct ion & small molecule flow from one neuron to the other.
- Usually bidirectional
- Fastest type of neural communication <1ms
Lee et al. J Neurosci.2014 Sep 24;34(39):13170-82. doi: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0562-14.2014.
Inject dye into neuron 
labeled with orange arrow 
and dye travels through gap 
junctions to label neurons 
that are connected via 
electric synapses
Injection of dye only labels 
one neuron because the cell 
does not have any gap 
junctions.
No gap junctions

Neuronal Cilia 
- every neuron has a cilium (~2-4um long) which generally emerges from the cell body
-  function of the cilium is poorly understood
Sarkisian & Guadiana 2014
14
Clinical correlate: serious neurodevelopmental disorders are associated with mutation of 
Genes important for cilia development. 
ARL13B gene mutation causes defecitis in cilia development and Joubert Syndrome – characterized by 
midbrain & hindbrain malformations, intellectual disability, retinal dystrophy, cystic renal disease, congenital 
hepatic fibrosis  and polydactyly

Gap junctions & Electrical synapses in Astrocytes
19
- Connected to other astrocytes as well as oligodendrocytes by gap junctions  
- Can respond/”react” to tissue damage and form a glial scar but role not well 
understood  (i.e. harmful or helpful such as in spinal cord injury)
Clinical correlate:
Glial fibrillary acid protein (Gfap) is the gold standard molecular marker for reactive astrocytes and is used for detection 
of astro-gliosis (brain injury) and tumors made up of astroctyes (i.e. astrocytoma).
Mutation of the GFAP gene causes Alexander disease leukodystrophy which is characterized by childhood white matter 
development disruptions, and diverse symptoms such as cognitive and motor delays, loss of motor control.

Oligodendrocytes/Schwann cells
CH. 6, Clinical Neuroanatomy & Neuroscience, Saunders/Elsevier
- myelin-producing cells of the CNS/PNS (respectively)
- differ in the number of axons that they envelop
 (i.e. oligos envelop more than one axon; Schwann cells envelop only one.)
- Both cell types causal to demyelinating and dysmyelinating diseases (e.g. 
Multiple Sclerosis) 
- Continuously produced in brain

Clinical correlates
Autoimmune disorder where patients have IgG against MOG - 
myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein. MOG is a glycoprotein 
uniquely expressed in oligodendrocytes in the CNS.  MOG 
antibody disorder (MOGAD) is an idiopathic, inflammatory, 
demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). 
Diverse peripheral and central symptoms including optic neuritis 
(loss or blurry vision, eye pain), transverse myelitis (weakness, 
numbness, pain, loss of bowel or bladder control).
 
Olig2 is a protein exclusively found in oligodendrocytes and is a 
maker for oligodendroglioma which can present with diverse 
symptoms such as headache, weakness, seizures, cognitive 
changes, etc.
Myelin found in between  nodes of 
Ranvier
Oligodendrocytes ensheathe axons 
from more than one neuron.
Schwann cells ensheathe only 1 
neuron.
