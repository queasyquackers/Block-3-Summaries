00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:03,050
Hello, I'm Dr.
Sonia Rivera

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:05,190
-Martinez, Associate
Professor,

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:06,810
Department of
Family Medicine,

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,350
and our topic
for today is

5
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:11,930
History and
Physical Exam of the

6
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:14,790
Gastrointestinal
System Part 2.

7
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:20,250
Our session objectives
for today's lecture

8
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,630
includes appropriate
history taking,

9
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:27,010
special abdominal
examination techniques and

10
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:29,890
correlating these with
common etiologies.

11
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:34,030
Clinical features
for common abdominal

12
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:37,770
pain or contipation
etiology.

13
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,290
Correlating the
clinical presentation

14
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:45,830
with common etiologies
for constipation and

15
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:48,410
developing a differential
diagnosis and

16
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:52,190
treatment plan for a
patient with constipation.

17
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,510
We will have now a brief

18
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:58,030
discussion of the
history of pleasant

19
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:00,310
illness for
abdominal pain.

20
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,050
In the next few
slides, we're going

21
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:08,210
to be correlating
parts of the HPI with

22
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:10,570
different presentations
and what those

23
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,990
presentations might
mean. For example,

24
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:16,850
a patient complaining
of sudden,

25
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,510
like a light switching
on. You may think

26
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:24,330
of a perforated
ulcer, renal stone,

27
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:27,210
a ruptured
ectopic pregnancy,

28
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:31,410
ruptured aneurysm,
possible torsion of the

29
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:35,930
ovaries or intestines.
If it is less sudden,

30
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,650
it includes most
other causes.

31
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:41,310
Previous episodes might

32
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,350
include ulcer disease,

33
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:46,350
diverticulitis,
middle schmurz.

34
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:50,030
For palliation and
provocation, if

35
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:52,630
it is relieved by
antacids, you might

36
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,910
think about peptic
ulcer disease.

37
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:58,930
If it's relieved by
lying very still,

38
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:02,160
then maybe think
of peritonitis.

39
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:06,670
As far as the
quality of pain,

40
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:10,390
descriptions such
as acute waves of

41
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:14,710
sharp constricting
pain may be related to

42
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:19,990
kidney or biliary
colic, waves

43
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:22,090
of dull pain
with vomiting,

44
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,730
intestinal obstruction,

45
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,890
a sharp constant
pain worsened

46
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:31,450
by movement, may
be peritonitis,

47
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:36,150
a tearing pain,
think of dissecting

48
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:39,510
aneurysm, and
then a dull ache,

49
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:43,950
others such as
appendicitis,

50
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,310
diverticulitis,

51
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:48,630
or pyelonephritis,
many itises.

52
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,970
I skipped here
colicky pain that

53
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:54,820
became study. It can be

54
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:59,390
appendicitis,
mesenteric ischemia.

55
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:04,550
The place to where
the pain radiates

56
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,850
might also give you
a clue of what the

57
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:10,190
acute abdominal pain
may be. For example,

58
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:12,310
radiation to the right

59
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:15,070
scapula,
gallbladder pain,

60
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:18,070
left shoulder or ruptured

61
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:20,410
spleen or pancreatitis.

62
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,630
In the ***** or vagina,
it could even be

63
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:30,270
renal pain or back,
ruptured aortic aneurysm.

64
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:33,750
Let's see about
the severity. When

65
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:37,330
it's severe,
really severe, you

66
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:39,590
might think of a
perforated viscus,

67
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,510
a kidney stone,

68
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:45,210
pancreatitis, or
even peritonitis.

69
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,590
And pain out of
proportion to

70
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:51,590
physical findings.
This one is

71
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:54,190
common for
mesenteric ischemia.

72
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:58,410
In looking at the
timing of the acute

73
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:01,410
abdominal pain.
If it is gradual,

74
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:04,420
think of things such
as diverticulitis

75
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:07,710
or cholecystitis. If it's

76
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:11,050
paroxysmal,
perhaps intestinal

77
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:14,410
obstruction, renal
or biliary colic.

78
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:19,090
Persistent and
stable, fits

79
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:21,790
more likely pancreatitis.

80
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:26,130
As far as associated
symptoms that

81
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:29,170
occur with acute
abdominal pain. If you

82
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,930
have a patient that
states they have

83
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:35,370
vomiting that precedes
the occurrence

84
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:38,430
of pain and is
followed by diarrhea,

85
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:41,840
this may be related
to gastroenteritis.

86
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:46,730
On another one,
delayed vomiting with

87
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:50,750
absent bowel
movement, inflatis, it

88
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:54,110
could be related
to acute intestinal

89
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:57,990
obstruction. Note that
the delay increases

90
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:00,930
with a lower site
of obstruction.

91
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:06,190
Severe vomiting that
precedes intense

92
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:10,670
epigastric left chest
or shoulder pain.

93
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:14,810
Think of emetic
perforation of

94
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:18,250
the intra-abdominal
esophagus.

95
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:23,650
Now just a word of
caution, remember that

96
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:27,710
any of the symptoms
discussed in the HPI

97
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:31,830
slides, you need to
also be able to match

98
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:36,790
them up with any
physical exam findings.

99
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:40,550
So alone and themselves,
they point to

100
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:45,150
a suspicion to certain
etiologies without

101
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:48,230
the physical exam
findings, they

102
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:50,930
don't prove to be so.
So you need both of

103
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:53,360
them to come up with
the differential.

104
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:57,130
Now let us look
at abdominal

105
00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:00,550
pain and anatomic
considerations.

106
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:05,130
Knowledge of the
location of the abdominal

107
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:08,770
pain can assist in
developing an appropriate

108
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:12,530
differential diagnosis
as it may target

109
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:16,770
the organs that may or
may not be involved.

110
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:21,130
As we will see in the
next few slides, we

111
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:25,330
will be using here the
four quadrants, right

112
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:28,610
upper quadrant, left
upper quadrant, right

113
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:31,630
lower quadrant, and
left lower quadrant.

114
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:36,830
Pain that's localized
to the right

115
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:40,330
upper quadrant can
be cholecystitis,

116
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:44,510
hepatitis, perforated
duodenal ulcer,

117
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:47,370
left upper
quadrant, gastritis,

118
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:50,170
or splenic disorders,

119
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:55,790
right lower quadrant,
appendicitis,

120
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,990
secal diverticulitis, and

121
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:00,550
the left lower quadrant,

122
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:05,810
sigmoid diverticulitis.
If patient

123
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:10,330
indicates that the pain
encompasses the entire

124
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:14,490
abdomen, think of
acute pancreatitis,

125
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:17,770
possibly early
appendicitis,

126
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:20,310
intestinal obstruction,

127
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:22,930
mesenteric ischemia.

128
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:28,330
For left or right
upper quadrant,

129
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:31,510
think of also
acute pancreatitis.

130
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,870
lower lobe pneumonia,

131
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:36,990
myocardial ischemia,

132
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:40,430
also ****** zoster. Make

133
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:42,110
sure you check the skin.

134
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:45,610
Right or left
lower quadrant.

135
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:48,830
You can have
abdominal abscess,

136
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,450
cystitis,

137
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:52,130
endometriosis,

138
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:56,070
abdominal wall hematomas,
fibromas, medial

139
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:58,930
schmerz, pelvic
inflammatory disease,

140
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,870
renal stones,

141
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:04,050
ruptured ectopic
pregnancy,

142
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:05,010
and others.

143
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:09,570
Let us review the
visceral pain patterns.

144
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:12,130
These pain
patterns follow

145
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:13,990
embryonic development.

146
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:15,790
So for example,

147
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:22,810
the appendix is a
midgut organ. Therefore,

148
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:26,320
you might start
off with visceral

149
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:30,450
pain pattern of
periumbilical pain.

150
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:35,430
That is very important
because people tend

151
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:39,050
to, initially with
appendicitis itself,

152
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:44,350
have periumbilical
pain that is vague and

153
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:47,730
then it ends up traveling
to the right side.

154
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:54,430
For the renal and
ureteral pain patterns,

155
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:57,970
you usually have
it flank that comes

156
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:02,670
starting from the back
and then travels to

157
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:05,630
the front all the way
to the groin region.

158
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:09,690
This is very common
for renal stones.

159
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:15,650
In referred pain
that is of extra

160
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:18,790
abdominal origin,
organs that are

161
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:22,010
outside of the
abdomen refer pain

162
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:25,250
into the abdomen.
For example,

163
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:29,190
a myocardial
infarction, the pain

164
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:31,550
can be felt as
if it was in the

165
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:34,150
stomach just
below the ribcage.

166
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:37,870
Lungs can also
have a similar

167
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:41,170
presentation, the
diaphragm and the

168
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:43,590
pelvic organs.
These are common.

169
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:49,230
Think of these as
possible places for

170
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:52,430
the etiology of the
acute abdominal pain.

171
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:56,070
We will now
proceed to cover

172
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:59,290
abdominal exam
special techniques.

173
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:04,430
Recall the order of
the abdominal exam.

174
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:08,670
You inspect, you
auscultate, percuss,

175
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:12,990
palpate, and then lastly
do the special test.

176
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:16,490
These are the
special tests

177
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,430
that we will be
reviewing today.

178
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:22,010
Assessment for
presence of ascites,

179
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:24,430

00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:33,250
obturator sign,
and psoas sign.

184
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:39,830
To identify for the
possible presence of

185
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:44,370
ascites in a patient
that has bulging flanks,

186
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:49,910
you would want to
percuss for shifting

187
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:54,090
dullness. This is
you would start one

188
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:58,210
with the patient
supine and then you

189
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:01,630
would percuss starting
from the middle

190
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:03,930
of the abdomen in
which there should

191
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:06,990
be tympani and then
continue laterally

192
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:11,570
and you may hear
dullness. You go in a

193
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:15,210
semicircular
manner from either

194
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:17,370
left to right or
right to left.

195
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:22,970
The other manner in
which you might also find

196
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:28,670
if there is ascites
present, you have the

197
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:32,790
patient in a lateral
recumbent position and

198
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:38,190
you would then percuss
from the one aspect

199
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:42,670
okay to the dependent
side. In other words,

200
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:45,190
the part that the
patient is laying down on

201
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:49,110
that would be the dependent
side. So you would

202
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:53,530
start from the other
side, the non-dependent,

203
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:57,010
and percuss. At that
part you would hear

204
00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:01,650
timpani and then
eventually you may hear

205
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:06,690
dullness that is in the
presence of ascites.

206
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:12,490
You can also attempt
to palpate for a

207
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:15,870
fluid wave. Here you
would need an assistant

208
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:18,430
to place their hands
in the middle as

209
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:22,370
shown in the picture
and then an examiner

210
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:26,450
places his or her
hands at the flank.

211
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:31,290
Then the examiner with
one hand applies a

212
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:38,670
sudden tap going towards
the middle with one

213
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:41,850
hand and monitors to
feel if they feel a

214
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:44,890
fluid wave on the other
side. And then you

215
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:48,030
can also repeat that
from the other aspects.

216
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:52,550
So you can do a tap
on the left and feel

217
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:56,530
on the right or do a
tap on the right and

218
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:59,190
then feel for the
fluid wave on the left.

219
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:03,770
The Lloyd sign,
also known as

220
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:06,330
costovertebral
angle tenderness,

221
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:13,950
you would tap between
T10 and T12 bilaterally.

222
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:17,590
You can either
strike the costal

223
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:21,450
vertebral angle with the
ulnar surface of your

224
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:26,270
fist or place the
ball of one hand on

225
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:30,030
the costal vertebral
angle and strike the

226
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:33,590
costal vertebral angle
with the fist ulnar

227
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:36,730
surface of the other
hand. Either way is

228
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:39,550
correct. You should
do this by laterally.

229
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:46,010
When Lloyd's sign or
costal vertebral angle

230
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:49,250
tenderness is positive,
meaning that when

231
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:52,150
you did the tap on
the patient with your

232
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:54,970
ulnar surface, the
patient complained of pain

233
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:59,030
directly in that area,
then you would need

234
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:02,370
to inquire about other
signs and symptoms.

235
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:06,130
What about their
voiding habits?

236
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:10,610
Additional personal
or family history of

237
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:14,190
genitourinary or renal
vascular disorders.

238
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:20,670
This table contains
medical causes along

239
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:24,150
with their clinical
manifestations for when

240
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:27,910
Lloyd's sign or
costal vertebral angle

241
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:32,090
tenderness is present.
In lephrolithiasis,

242
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:34,490
the patient would be
complaining of waves

243
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:37,690
or waxing and waning
flank pain that may

244
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:41,990
radiate. If there is
a perirenal abscess

245
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:46,770
then there would be
severe unilateral flank

246
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:51,250
pain along with
dysuria, fever, chills,

247
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:54,850
you might see erythema
of the skin and a

248
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:58,270
palpable abdominal mass
may even be present.

249
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:03,590
For acute
pyelonephritis, You would

250
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:06,210
have high fevers,
chill. There

251
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:09,110
would also be flank
pain and dysuria.

252
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:12,490
You would also see
blood in the urine.

253
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:16,030
Possibly the patient
might have nocturia,

254
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,330
urinary frequency,

255
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:20,750
anorexia,

256
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:22,370
and nausea and vomiting.

257
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:25,550
For renal artery
occlusion,

258
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,330
there would
be flank pain.

259
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:32,030
To elicit nerfy signs,

260
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:36,990
you could either hook
the left thumb or

261
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:40,350
fingers from the right
hand in the right

262
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:44,030
upper quadrant. Then
you ask the patient to

263
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:49,310
take deep breaths
during the palpation.

264
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,250
If

265
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:54,350
there is a sharp
increase in the

266
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:58,010
tenderness and the
patient suddenly

267
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:00,570
stops the
inspiratory effort

268
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:04,070
that constitutes
a positive test

269
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:07,850
and this would
be positive for

270
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:10,970
possible acute
cholecystitis.

271
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:15,950
Acute cholecystitis
is usually

272
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:18,730
related to
gallstone disease.

273
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:22,850
Customarily, there is
right upper quadrant

274
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:27,630
pain that is gradual
and steady. It may

275
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:30,750
radiate to the right
shoulder or back.

276
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:34,790
Patients will
typically have fever,

277
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:39,150
elevated white cell
count, nausea, vomiting,

278
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:42,150
and might have much
of an appetite.

279
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:46,270
There customarily
is also a history

280
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:49,090
of fatty food
ingestion and

281
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:52,310
Murphy's sign tends
to be positive.

282
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:56,450
Rebound may
also be present

283
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:59,430
due to peritoneal
inflammation.

284
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:05,350
Murphy's point is
located one-third from

285
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:09,650
the ASIS and two-thirds
from the umbilicus

286
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:13,190
in the right lower
quadrant. Pain at this

287
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:17,730
point is suggestive
of acute appendicitis.

288
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:25,290
Acute appendicitis
customarily presents with

289
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:28,670
point tenderness at
the McBurnie's point.

290
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:31,630
Right lower quadrant pain

291
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:34,090
that is gradual
and steady.

292
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:37,670
There is nausea,
vomiting, fever,

293
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,810
and anorexia.

294
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:42,550
You should assess four.

295
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:44,690
Rebound tenderness,

296
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:46,970
referred rebound
tenderness,

297
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,630
Robson signs,

298
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,770
psoas signs,
obturator signs,

299
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:55,450
and cutaneous
hyperesthesia where

300
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:58,390
touching lightly the
patient feels pain.

301
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:05,790
Peritoneal pain or
peritonitis. This occurs

302
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:08,290
when there is
inflammation of the

303
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:12,390
peritoneal cavity. There
are multiple causes,

304
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:17,890
but this is most serious
when it is present.

305
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:21,170
The patient might
die within a few

306
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:24,780
days, so it needs to
be recognized readily.

307
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:28,990
There are multiple
causes. As I

308
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:31,530
mentioned, the
most serious cause

309
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:34,430
is perforation
of the GI tract.

310
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:38,250
This perforation
may cause fluid to

311
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,770
shift into the
peritoneal cavity along

312
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:47,270
with also organisms from
the gastrointestinal

313
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:50,230
tract into the
peritoneal cavity.

314
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:54,450
The patient will
look very ill and

315
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:59,350
lies very still to
minimize discomfort.

316
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:04,130
Even bumping into
their bed might

317
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:06,920
cause them to be in
extreme discomfort.

318
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:11,230
So be very alert
to this one. It

319
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:14,210
has high morbidity
and mortality.

320
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:18,030
For rebound tenderness,

321
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,880
what you want
to do is palpate

322
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,130
the abdomen by
pressing deeply

323
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:25,790
with the pads of
the fingertips.

324
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:29,890
After a moment
of that pressure,

325
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:32,710
quickly release
the pressure.

326
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:37,070
Notice any signs of
pain either in the

327
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:40,170
face or that the patient
actually verbalizes

328
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:43,770
it. The test is
positive if there is

329
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:53,070
more pain with
releasing the pressure.

330
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:57,470
It is suggestive
of peritonitis.

331
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:02,090
Rebound tenderness
elicited in the right

332
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:06,170
lower quadrant is
suggestive of appendicitis.

333
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:12,490
Acute pancreatitis,
generally rapid at

334
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:16,970
onset. There is
severe mid-epigastric

335
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:20,840
or upper abdominal
pain commonly

336
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:25,410
associated with
alcoholism or gallstones.

337
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:27,650
There's many
other causes but

338
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:29,870
these are the
most common. There

339
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:32,930
is also nausea,
vomiting, fever.

340
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:37,890
Pain may be relieved
with bending forward.

341
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:42,290
The pain may radiate
to the back or

342
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:46,150
around both costal
margins to the back.

343
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:52,690
Referred rebound
tenderness. The

344
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:56,910
examiner would
palpate by pressing

345
00:20:56,910 --> 00:21:00,230
deeply any one
of the quadrants

346
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:03,710
and then after
having the pressure

347
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:08,370
for a little bit,
releases it quickly.

348
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:12,690
Patient feels pain
in another quadrant

349
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:16,410
with the release of
pressure again with

350
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:19,510
the release of
pressure. This too is

351
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:22,690
suggestive of
peritonitis. So in the

352
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:25,910
arrows here you would
press on the left

353
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:31,070
and then pain is
elicited on rebound in

354
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:33,630
the right upper
quadrant. This is an

355
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:36,530
example of referred
rebound tenderness.

356
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:40,270
Acute diverticulitis
generally

357
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:43,990
occurs in
individuals who are

358
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:46,610
elderly but not
exclusively.

359
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:51,670
There is generally
either right lower

360
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:55,810
quadrant or left lower
quadrant pain that

361
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:59,430
can be present for
several days. This

362
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:02,190
usually occurs in the
left lower quadrant.

363
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:05,930
There is commonly
fever and

364
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:08,050
chills as part
of this syndrome.

365
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:10,930
Mildly distended abdomen

366
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,770
can also be present.

367
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:18,470
Bowel sounds are
customarily absent.

368
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:25,090
There is inflammation
and focal necrosis

369
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:30,550
if present may result
from bowel perforation

370
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:33,230
which make this a
lot more serious.

371
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:37,150
Recurrence is very
common so you should

372
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:40,710
really ask the patient
who you suspect has

373
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:44,110
diverticulitis whether
or not they've had a

374
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:49,590
episode previously and
you may feel a palpable

375
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:55,310
tendon mass in the
left lower quadrant or

376
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:57,250
the right lower
quadrant, depending on

377
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:00,230
where this diverticulitis
might be occurring.

378
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:05,670
Robsingh sign
is another sign

379
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:09,450
for suggestive
of appendicitis.

380
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:14,090
This one is different.
You palpate on the

381
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:18,390
left lower quadrant and
that produces pain in

382
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:22,230
the right lower quadrant.
It has nothing to

383
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:25,490
do, I repeat, nothing
to do with rebound

384
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:29,910
tenderness. It is simple
palpation on the left,

385
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:33,830
eliciting pain on the
right lower quadrant.

386
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:40,210
The obturator sign,
you have the patient

387
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:45,270
supine and then you
take their patient's

388
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:50,190
right lower extremity,
flex the patient's

389
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:53,450
right thigh at the
hip with the knee bent

390
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:57,590
and then you internally
rotate at the hip.

391
00:23:57,590 --> 00:24:03,150
Bring the ankle outward.
Pain elicited in

392
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:06,330
the right lower quadrant
is suggestive of

393
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:10,230
peritoneal inflammation
and appendicitis.

394
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:15,250
The obturator
sign, if positive,

395
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:21,310
usually indicates a
pelvic appendix. It may

396
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:25,750
occur with right pelvic
abscesses as well.

397
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:31,360
The inflamed appendix
is in the pelvis

398
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,570
and in contact
with the upright

399
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:39,670
internus muscle,
hence producing pain

400
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:42,650
when with the obturator
sign maneuver.

401
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:47,970
The psoas sign
can be elicited

402
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:49,570
in two different ways.

403
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:53,750
One with the patient
supine, the examiner

404
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,970
places the hand
just above the

405
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:59,810
knee and asked the
patient to rise their

406
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:02,910
right thigh against
your resistance.

407
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:06,330
The second way is
to have the patient

408
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:10,830
turn onto their left
side and then the

409
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:16,410
examiner takes the
right lower extremity

410
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:20,810
and extends the
right leg at the hip.

411
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:25,810
With that maneuver
or the previous

412
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:28,770
maneuver, an increase
in abdominal pain

413
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:32,510
would be suggestive
of appendicitis.

414
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:40,510
With the psoas sign,
it may indicate, if

415
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:44,230
positive, that the
appendix is retrocecal

416
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:47,750
and orientation. note
that the iliopsoas

417
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:52,050
muscles is retroperitoneal
and the appendix

418
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:57,290
would lie over the
psoas. Pain is elicited

419
00:25:57,290 --> 00:26:01,250
due to the friction
of the psoas muscle

420
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:05,250
against inflamed tissues
during the maneuver.

421
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:11,050
To complete the
physical exam here, you

422
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:13,990
would want to do a
****** examination.

423
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:19,450
Pain or interrectal
masses may be evaluated

424
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:21,790
during this
examination and you may

425
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:25,350
look for blood in the
stool. In females,

426
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:28,530
you should do also a
vaginal examination.

427
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:31,910
In males, a
testicular exam.

428
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:35,390
And in both females
and males, make sure

429
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:38,230
you evaluate for the
presence of hernias.

430
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:41,550
All of these can be
related to the acute

431
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:45,070
abdominal pain or
can be a cause of it.

432
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,110
Key points to
remember when

433
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,970
performing these
special tests.

434
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:54,730
Always observe
the patient from

435
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:56,670
the right side
of the patient.

436
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:58,950
Always explain to the

437
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,530
patient what
you are doing.

438
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:04,870
Observe the patient
for signs of pain.

439
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:08,350
Don't rely only on
verbal cues that

440
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:09,970
they're telling you
that there is pain.

441
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:13,390
More importantly,
the special tests

442
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:16,430
are used to
confirm a diagnosis

443
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:19,730
you are considering
from your history

444
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:22,610
and other abdominal
examination.

445
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:26,770
We will now discuss
evaluation of

446
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:30,270
constipation, which is
a very common complaint.

447
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:35,950
This is from our
previous lecture, but as

448
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:38,210
a reminder for the
discussion of today,

449
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:40,970
definitions of
constipation.

450
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:42,190
For physicians,

451
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:43,970
it's fewer than three

452
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:45,850
bowel movements per week.

453
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:47,670
For patients,

454
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:51,570
it may mean hard
stools, feeling

455
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:53,850
of incomplete evacuation,

456
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:58,770
having to strain
excessively, a sense

457
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:01,890
that there is a
blockage in the

458
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:06,350
**** ****** region
during defecation,

459
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:10,370
and also the need
to perform manual

460
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:13,260
maneuvers to be
able to ********.

461
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:19,450
There are several
clinical subgroups related

462
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:23,890
to constipation. We
have primary colorectal

463
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:27,070
dysfunction which
includes normal transit

464
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:30,770
constipation in
which there there is

465
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:35,910
normal **** ******
function and the transit of

466
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:39,150
the stool throughout
the colon is normal.

467
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:43,230
Then you have slow
transit constipation

468
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:47,130
which also has normal
**** ****** function

469
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:50,090
but there is
prolonged delay in the

470
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:51,990
stool transit
through the colon.

471
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:56,570
Next, you have
defecatory disorders.

472
00:28:56,710 --> 00:29:02,370
These are characterized
by impaired ******

473
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:07,030
evacuation from
inadequate ******

474
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:10,370
propulsive forces,
meaning that there is

475
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:14,850
difficulty pushing the
feces out, or there

476
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:18,510
is increased resistance
to evacuation.

477
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:22,310
Of this defecatory

478
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:25,170
disorder, there
is anismus,

479
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:28,670
which occurs
because there is

480
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:32,110
a high ****
resting pressure,

481
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:37,450
and dyssynergia,
which is incomplete

482
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:41,930
relaxation or there
is paradoxical

483
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:44,550
contraction of
the pelvic floor

484
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:47,910
and the external
**** sphincters.

485
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:53,210
You also may find
a combination of

486
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:56,670
overlap disorders
that would be the

487
00:29:56,670 --> 00:30:00,970
slow transit constipation
with defecatory

488
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:02,970
disorders would
be an example.

489
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:07,230
These may possibly
be associated

490
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:09,650
with irritable
bowel syndrome.

491
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:15,770
In approaching the
patient with constipation,

492
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:18,510
there should be a
clear understanding

493
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:20,930
of the patient's
complaint of

494
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:24,250
constipation. You need
to obtain the specifics.

495
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:26,710
What is it that
they are referring

496
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:29,300
to when they talk
about constipation?

497
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:33,450
You want to determine
if there is the presence

498
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:38,250
of any secondary
causes. also to consider

499
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:40,930
if there is metabolic
and structural

500
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:45,570
causes and then do an
evaluation accordingly.

501
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:50,510
If appropriate you
might do a trial

502
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:53,910
of having them take
over-the-counter

503
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:59,450
fiber plus or
minus laxative and

504
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:02,510
even consider
biofeedback therapy.

505
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:08,410
If there is an
adequate response to a

506
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:12,490
therapeutic trial, then
consider doing additional

507
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:16,310
testing such as ****
rector manometry,

508
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:18,910
recto balloon expulsion,

509
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:22,610
and others. Do
not be concerned

510
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:24,910
about these. This
is more for your

511
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:28,770
general knowledge
of these testing.

512
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:33,730
Regarding the history,

513
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:39,530
you want to ask the
patient what is the

514
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:41,990
symptom that is
most distressing to

515
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:45,930
them and give them
examples such as is

516
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:48,430
it because it's
infrequent, you have

517
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:53,950
to strain, the stools
are hard, or is

518
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:56,670
Is there symptoms
unrelated to bowel

519
00:31:56,670 --> 00:32:01,410
habits such as
bloating, pain, malaise?

520
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:07,250
Need for peritoneal
or vaginal pressure to

521
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:13,830
allow stools to be
passed or direct digital

522
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:16,290
evacuation is required.

523
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:18,870
You want to make sure
you ask these kinds

524
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:22,590
of questions to your
patients and then note

525
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:27,130
whether or not there may
be evacuatory disorders

526
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:31,490
that do not respond
well to laxatives.

527
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:33,410
So that's the
need why you would

528
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,250
need to have
this information.

529
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:40,890
How often does a
patient feel the need

530
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:43,980
to have a bowel
movement and whether

531
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:47,470
he or she feels a
sense of incomplete

532
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:51,570
evacuations. Are
they using laxatives?

533
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:55,150
If yes, how often
and what dosage?

534
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:59,090
Suppositories,
enemas? How often

535
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:02,450
are the bowels
moved? And what

536
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:04,690
is the consistency
of the stools?

537
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:10,030
On physical, you
should include an

538
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:13,270
abdominal exam
and a ****** exam.

539
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:16,710
Also depending,
you may need to

540
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:20,070
also include a
vaginal exam in

541
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:25,250
females to check
for ****** seals.

542
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:31,270
Check for signs of
anemia, weight loss,

543
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:34,590
abdominal masses, whether
or not their liver

544
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:38,190
is in charge, and if
there is a palpable

545
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:44,170
colon. inspect the
perineal for hemorrhoids,

546
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:47,290
which may interfere
with evacuation,

547
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:52,670
skin tags, ******
prolapse, hence this last

548
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:55,770
one was the ones that
I was talking about,

549
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:59,690
also to look in the
vagina of a female.

550
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:04,090
Ask patient to strain
and check if there's

551
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:08,230
any leakage and descent
of the perineum.

552
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:12,110
Test for an **** wink and

553
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:13,830
pelvic floor dysfunction.

554
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:18,450
Do a digital ******
exam. Make sure

555
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:20,190
that you determine
whether or not the

556
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:23,890
sphincter tone is
normal and assess the

557
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:26,730
****** walls to
feel for any masses.

558
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:29,830
Evaluate for
presence of a ******

559
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:32,170
seal. That's what I
mentioned earlier.

560
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:36,790
The place where the
patient complains

561
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:41,010
of a new onset of
constipation might

562
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:44,930
also clue you in
into certain causes.

563
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:46,510
For example, in
the hospitalized

564
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:50,930
patients, drugs and
supplements such

565
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:55,090
as opioids, calcium
channel blockers,

566
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:59,110
nonsteroidals, iron
supplements, antihistamines,

567
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:01,550
all of these can
cause constipation.

568
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:04,950
In the hospital,
the patient would

569
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:07,610
experience reduced
physical activity.

570
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:10,830
That too is a cause
for constipation,

571
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:14,290
particularly if
bedridden for

572
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:17,530
a length of time of
more than two weeks.

573
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:21,310
After surgery, it
takes a while to

574
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:24,930
recover from effects
of the anesthesia

575
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:28,470
which might also
cause the constipation

576
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:32,950
or slow the recovery
of the intestinal

577
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:37,490
movement that proposes
the feces out.

578
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:41,470
Dietary change may
not have enough

579
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:45,250
fiber in the diet of
the hospital food.

580
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:49,030
Dehydration that's
a big one. A lot

581
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:50,590
of people don't
drink sufficient

582
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:53,550
water to be able to
have normal bowel

583
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:56,830
movements, electrolyte
disturbances,

584
00:35:56,990 --> 00:36:00,610
***** impaction,
intestinal obstruction,

585
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:03,190
all of those are
common causes

586
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:05,410
of constipation
that is a new

587
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:07,570
complaint in a
hospitalized patient.

588
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:12,060
Here are some clinical
features and clinical

589
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:16,010
correlation to what
might be the etiologies.

590
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:22,550
For example, in colon
cancer, if it is new

591
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:26,050
onset of constipation
in an older patient

592
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:30,050
associated with blood
in the stool, or

593
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:31,890
if they don't see
blood in the stool

594
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:37,210
with iron deficiency
anemia, positive *****

595
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:39,710
cult test, weight
loss of more than

596
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:44,130
10 pounds. Note that
patients, Females

597
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:48,550
who have no longer
menstruate and older

598
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:52,870
males, they should
not be losing iron.

599
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:56,290
So that is a key
there as there might

600
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:59,610
be the possibility
of colon cancer.

601
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:04,250
Irritable bowel
symptoms where there

602
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:07,770
would be abdominal
bloating and cramping.

603
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:12,890
Pelvic floor dysfunction.
You would have

604
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:15,990
prolonged straining.
The patient would

605
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:18,930
feel the need to do
digital evacuation.

606
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:23,370
Lack of pelvic
lift when you

607
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:25,270
do a digital ****** exam.

608
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:29,510
sacral nerve
pathology. Hence, you

609
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:32,030
would check for
the **** wink. If

610
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:35,170
it's not present,
then possibly there

611
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:37,950
is pathology of
the sacral nerves.

612
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:40,250
***** impaction.

613
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:44,010
When you do the
digital ****** exam and

614
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:48,250
there is leakage of
stool, this occurs

615
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:50,590
a lot of the elderly,
particularly those

616
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:52,830
who have not been
really well hydrated.

617
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:58,090
and **** fissure,
the presence of, when

618
00:37:58,090 --> 00:38:00,870
there is pain on
digital ****** exam.

619
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:05,970
The differential
diagnoses for

620
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:10,070
constipation includes
many disorders,

621
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:15,150
abdominal hernias,
psychological, endocrine

622
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:18,250
disorders, which
lead to neuropathy,

623
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:21,470
particularly this is
seen with diabetes.

624
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:25,530
infectious
disease, sepsis,

625
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:28,170
neoplasm, meaning
the presence

626
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:30,740
of malignancy
in the colon,

627
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:34,170
neurodegenerative
disorders,

628
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:36,630
rheumatological
disorders, and of

629
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:38,790
course gastrointestinal
disorders.

630
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:43,950
It is very important
for you to know when to

631
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:47,510
order an endoscopic
evaluation for a patient

632
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:50,850
complaining of
constipation. This would

633
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:54,730
be in general for patients
older than 50 years

634
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:59,510
old with no history
of colorectal cancer,

635
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:04,330
before doing any surgery
for constipation,

636
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:07,390
change in the stool

637
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:11,810
caliber, a heme
positive stools meaning

638
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:13,710
that there is
presence of blood,

639
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:18,790
iron deficiency
anemia for females who

640
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:22,070
are postmenopausal
and men in general,

641
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:25,930
whether or not there
is the presence of

642
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:30,030
obstructive symptoms,
****** bleeding,

643
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:34,130
****** prolapse,
weight loss, and that

644
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:37,400
there is a recent
onset of constipation.

645
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:41,630
Note that these
indications may

646
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:45,350
also be part of
those for a screening

647
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:47,710
colonoscopy but
not all of them.

648
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:52,960
We will now look
into a case of

649
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,890
constipation. Here
Here is a 62 year old

650
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:59,330
female coming to your
office complaining

651
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:01,630
of constipation
that started about

652
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:04,850
nine months ago and
has been worsening

653
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:07,310
over the past three
to four months.

654
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:10,270
She currently
reports one to

655
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:12,730
two bowel
movements per week.

656
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:14,990
She states that she needs

657
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:17,090
to strain to ********.

658
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:21,150
She produces hard stool
and feels she does

659
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:24,950
not completely evacuate.
The patient has

660
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:28,870
tried increasing her
fiber and fluid intake,

661
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:32,150
eating prunes,
drinking prune

662
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:34,850
juice, but nothing
has been helpful.

663
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:39,110
She states she is
unable to produce

664
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:42,430
stools without
using laxatives. She

665
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:45,770
denies nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea,

666
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:48,850
blood in stools,
abdominal pain, abdominal

667
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:52,550
bloating, changes to
the form of her stool,

668
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:55,310
fever, chills, fatigue,

669
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:57,070
or weight changes.

670
00:40:58,370 --> 00:41:02,070
For her past medical
history, she has high

671
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:04,510
blood pressure,
hypothyroidism, and

672
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:08,030
hyperlipidemia. For past
surgical history, an

673
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:11,870
appendectomy and
cholecystectomy. No allergies.

674
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:14,830
For medications,
she takes enalopril,

675
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:19,090
levothyroxine, atorvastatin,
and vitamin D3.

676
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:22,550
As social history,
she denies tobacco,

677
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:26,090
alcohol, or recreational
drug use. She drinks

678
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:29,510
one to two cups of
coffee a day, is married

679
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:31,630
and ******** active
with her husband.

680
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:34,830
The patient is a
pediatrician. She

681
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:38,610
eats usually a healthy
diet. On family

682
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:41,270
history, her mother
and father are

683
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:43,730
alive and well.
She has no sibling.

684
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:45,690
She does have
two daughters

685
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:47,710
who are also
alive and well.

686
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,970
For health care
maintenance,

687
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:51,010
she is up to date.

688
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:53,990
On review of systems,

689
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:57,290
all of the items
asked of her

690
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:59,210
were negative.

691
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:05,530
On physical exam,
the patient's

692
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:07,530
vital sign was normal.

693
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:12,070
General chest, heart,
lungs, abdomen,

694
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:17,830
extremities, skin,
musculoskeletal, neuro, gait,

695
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:22,130
****** examinations
were all normal. On

696
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:26,910
osteopathic structural
exam we found L1 flexed,

697
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:31,210
rotated, and side
bent right. We did a

698
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:35,430
Guayaquil test which
was negative times 1.

699
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:39,910
Let us now summarize
this case. We

700
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:43,090
have a 62-year-old
female presenting

701
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:46,030
with a complaint
of constipation for

702
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:49,090
the past nine months
and worsening over

703
00:42:49,090 --> 00:42:51,730
the past three to
four months. She

704
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:54,670
has 1 to 2 bowel
movements per week,

705
00:42:54,910 --> 00:42:58,090
strains to ********
hard stools, and

706
00:42:58,090 --> 00:43:00,870
has a feeling of
incomplete evacuation.

707
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:04,530
She increased
fiber and fluid egg

708
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:06,830
take and it was
not healthful.

709
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:12,130
She must use laxative
to produce stools.

710
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:14,970
She has a history
of hypertension,

711
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:18,690
hypothyroidism,
hyperlipidemia, had

712
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:21,000
an appendectomy and
a cholecystectomy.

713
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:26,870
Physical exam, including
****** exam, was

714
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:30,510
all within normal
limits except for the

715
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:34,610
osteopathic structural
exam finding of L1 flex

716
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:40,650
rotated side bent right
and then we did a lab.

717
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:44,610
Guayak stool was
negative times one.

718
00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:50,130
Let's look into
now possible

719
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:53,150
causes for this
patient's symptoms.

720
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:56,270
Would it be
Chagas disease,

721
00:43:56,690 --> 00:43:58,750
hypothyroidism,

722
00:43:59,290 --> 00:44:01,790
functional
defecation disorder,

723
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:06,110
irritable bowel syndrome,
or colon cancer.

724
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:13,370
Chagas disease is
caused by Tripa Sonoma

725
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:18,410
Cruzi. The vector is
triamptamine bugs.

726
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:22,590
There are major
manifestations for Chagas

727
00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:26,590
which include myopathy
and gastrointestinal

728
00:44:26,590 --> 00:44:30,470
disease. It has several
forms and phases,

729
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:35,490
usually found in the
southern cone of South

730
00:44:35,490 --> 00:44:39,290
America and Central
America and Mexico.

731
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:41,490
The symptoms,

732
00:44:41,870 --> 00:44:44,150
usually it is slowly

733
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:46,710
progressive,
constipation,

734
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:50,230
there is abdominal
bloating, less

735
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:52,430
often you might
find colically

736
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:56,270
abdominal pain.
The patient may be

737
00:44:56,270 --> 00:44:59,310
unable to pass
stools for weeks.

738
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:02,070
There would be a history

739
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:04,240
of recurrent volvulus,

740
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:07,050
which is a twisting
of the colon,

741
00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:10,730
and anorexia may develop.

742
00:45:10,730 --> 00:45:14,350
Consider all
of these in the

743
00:45:14,350 --> 00:45:16,630
case then's presentation.

744
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:22,440
In hypothyroidism. Now
know that our patient

745
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,610
does have a history
of hypothyroidism.

746
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:28,660
In hypothyroidism,
what you have

747
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:30,820
is a thyroid gland
that does not

748
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:33,400
produce sufficient
thyroid hormone.

749
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:36,560
Most common cause by

750
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,560
inflammation
of the gland.

751
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:42,300
There are other
causes including

752
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:45,720
congenital radiation
treatment, surgical

753
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:48,680
and radioactive
iodine treatment.

754
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:52,220
Risk factors include
being a female,

755
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:56,580
being over the age
of 50, and symptoms

756
00:45:56,580 --> 00:46:00,100
would include
constipation, depression,

757
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:01,160
fatigue,

758
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:03,980
feeling slowed down,

759
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:06,340
joint or muscle pain,

760
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:10,580
thin, brittle hair
or fingernails, and

761
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:14,700
unintentional weight
gain. Again, look

762
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:17,180
at how our patient
presented it and

763
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:21,560
see if it coincides
with any of this.

764
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:27,700
For functional
defecation disorder and

765
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:32,760
like disorders, we
use Rome for criteria.

766
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:37,460
All of these
criteria require that

767
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:41,360
the fulfillment
of the specific

768
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:45,360
criteria for the
disordered be present

769
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:48,680
for at least
three months with

770
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:51,520
the symptom onset
of at least six

771
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,780
months prior to
the diagnosis.

772
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:58,800
So the patients
will satisfy the

773
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,860
criteria for
functional constipation

774
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:06,940
with the following.
During repeated

775
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:10,300
attempts to ********,
the patient must

776
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:12,920
have at least two
of the following.

777
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:18,320
Evidence of impaired
evacuation based

778
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:21,340
on balloon expulsion
test or imaging.

779
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:24,140
Inappropriate
contraction of

780
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:26,950
the pelvic
floor muscles or

781
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:30,100
less than 20
percent relaxation

782
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:34,720
of the resting
sphincter on manometry

783
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:39,200
or inadequate
propulsive forces

784
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:42,020
assessed by
manometry or imaging.

785
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:46,080
Then you might
have this divided

786
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:47,820
into two different types.

787
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:51,520
Dysinergic
defecation, which is

788
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:54,720
inappropriate contraction
of the pelvic floor

789
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:59,560
or less than 20%
relaxation of the

790
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:02,460
sphincter pressure.
And then you also

791
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:05,600
have inadequate
defecatory propulsion,

792
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:09,920
which is inadequate
propulsive forces

793
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,980
with or without
inappropriate contraction

794
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:16,220
of the **** sphincter.

795
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:20,060
Correlate this with the

796
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:21,640
patient's presentation.

797
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,840
Another possible
syndrome,

798
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:28,300
irritable bowel
syndrome, room

799
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:30,640
for criteria
again is used

800
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:35,020
and to meet the
criteria there would be

801
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:38,660
recurrent abdominal
pain at least one

802
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:41,100
day per week in the
last three months

803
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:44,240
and that is associated
with two or more

804
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:47,700
of the following
related to defecation

805
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:50,920
onset associated
with change in the

806
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:55,040
frequency of stool
onset associated with a

807
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:58,100
change in the form
appearance of stool.

808
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:01,780
Criteria again
must be fulfilled

809
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:03,520
for at least three
months with the

810
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:06,520
symptom on fit at
least nine months.

811
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:10,300
Then you have if there

812
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:12,260
is a constipation type.

813
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:17,920
Patient reports that
their abnormal bowel

814
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,640
movements are
usually constipation.

815
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:24,280
Have a hard time
passing stool, need to

816
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:27,580
strain, feel cramps,
often do not release

817
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:31,560
any stools or only
a small amount.

818
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:36,200
Intensity of the
symptoms vary on and off.

819
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:39,520
Again look at
what the patient's

820
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:42,700
symptoms are and
this criteria.

821
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:47,920
Colon cancer usually
all types start as non

822
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:51,740
-cancerous polyp then
progress to cancer.

823
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:57,080
Risk are patients
older than 60,

824
00:49:57,080 --> 00:50:00,860
African-American or
European descent,

825
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:04,700
diet high in red
or processed meats,

826
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:07,820
family or personal
history of cancer,

827
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:11,440
irritable bowel disease,

828
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,420
symptoms, abdominal pain,

829
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:17,920
diarrhea, diarrhea,
constipation, or other

830
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:22,780
bowel changes, narrow
stools, weight loss,

831
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:24,440
blood and stools,

832
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:27,660
and anemia without
other GI symptoms.

833
00:50:32,010 --> 00:50:34,120
Okay, so now let's look

834
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:36,520
at the working diagnosis.

835
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:40,960
Chagos disease, unlikely.

836
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,380
Even though
the patient has

837
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:45,620
a history of
hypothyroidism,

838
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:48,120
it is unlikely
as she is not

839
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:50,120
presenting with
anything new, has

840
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:52,600
had this disorder
for a while.

841
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:56,620
Functional defecation
disorder is most

842
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:59,300
likely, but we would
have to do other studies.

843
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:02,660
Irritable bowel
syndrome is a maybe,

844
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:05,240
and so is colon
cancer a maybe.

845
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:10,760
So now that we have
summarized everything,

846
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:14,860
let's do from the S
and the O, subjective

847
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:17,300
and objective, we're
going to move to the

848
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:21,100
assessment and plan.
Here we have differential

849
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:23,640
diagnosis and
assessment of functional

850
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:26,260
defecation disorder.
We said irritable

851
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:28,860
bowel syndrome and
possible colon cancer.

852
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:31,000
The patient does have

853
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,320
hypothyroidism,
hypertension,

854
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:36,140
and hyperlipidemia,
and we found the

855
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:39,800
somatic dysfunction of
the lumbar spine. So

856
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:44,040
our plan is going
to check her thyroid

857
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:52,340
with a TSH and a free
T4. Do a CBC to find

858
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:59,400
out if she has anemia
of iron deficiency

859
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:02,880
and a complete
metabolic panel. This

860
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,640
would be for her other
disorders. We will

861
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:09,520
do GUIAC stools
times three to double

862
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,790
check the one that
we did in the office.

863
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:15,560
Order a gastrointestinal

864
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:17,780
specialist consultation.

865
00:52:18,150 --> 00:52:20,580
This would be
for her to have

866
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:22,940
consideration of
a colonoscopy.

867
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:27,280
Continue her
current medications.

868
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:31,760
Do a behavioral
psychologist consult

869
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,900
that would help
if she does indeed

870
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:37,080
have functional
defecation disorder.

871
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:41,980
And also to conduct
biofeedback therapy

872
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:45,940
of the pelvic floor
and retraining,

873
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:49,920
education on diet,
low salt, low

874
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:53,180
lipids due to her
disorder. We would

875
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:57,420
do OMT at a future
visit or at that

876
00:52:57,420 --> 00:53:02,020
visit and follow up
after visit to GI.

877
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:06,520
These are the references
that were used

878
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:11,000
for the preparation of
this lecture. They're

879
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,320
all listed under
the respective slide

880
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:18,800
number for you to
be able to look for

881
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,700
additional information
if you choose to do so.

882
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:26,500
This concludes
this presentation.

883
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:29,640
