00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,260
Hello everyone, my
name is Noel Batista,

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:05,760
I'm one of the
academic medicine

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,240
scholars, and today I
will be giving you your

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,600
mini lecture for
OMM Lab Number 13,

5
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:14,640
Lumbar HVLA and
Posterior Counterstrain.

6
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:20,460
here are your learning
objectives by the

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,500
end of the lab you'll
be able to diagnose

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,900
type 1 and type 2 lumbar
somatic dysfunctions

9
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,980
you will also be able
to identify indications

10
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,600
and contraindications
for lumbar hvla

11
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,260
and lumbar counter
strain techniques you

12
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,320
will safely perform
lumbar hvla for type 1

13
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,740
and type 2 dysfunctions
and you will learn

14
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,900
to correctly set up
and appropriately

15
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,000
treat posterior lumbar
counterstrain points.

16
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,760
It's important to
remember landmarks

17
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:49,940
to help with
our diagnosis.

18
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,780
Landmarks to know for
this lab are that the

19
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:56,340
12th rib attaches to
T12, the iliac crest

20
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,000
height is at the
interspace between L4

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,780
and L5, and the PSIS
is at the level of S2.

22
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,560
Let's briefly review
lumbar diagnosis.

23
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:11,000
First, screen to
identify posterior

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,100
transverse
processes which will

25
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,900
tell you the
rotational freedom.

26
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,680
Then use landmarks
to determine

27
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,020
the level of
the dysfunction.

28
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,500
Induce flexion and
extension to the level

29
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,520
of the segment to
determine if it is

30
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,660
a type 1 or type 2
somatic dysfunction.

31
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,960
Remember, if the
segment becomes

32
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,000
more symmetric
in flexion or

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,660
extension, it is a
type 2 dysfunction.

34
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,360
If there is no
improvement of

35
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,180
asymmetry with flexion or

36
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,380
extension is a
type 1 dysfunction.

37
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,980
Confirm your diagnosis
by inducing lateral

38
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,140
translation of the
affected segment

39
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,380
to determine the
side bending freedom.

40
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,980
Here is your
friendly reminder to

41
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,500
perform soft tissue
techniques before

42
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,080
performing any
HVLA technique.

43
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,780
There are no absolute
contraindications for

44
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:05,660
soft tissue techniques,
but some cautions

45
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,400
and relative
contraindications for local

46
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,720
application include any
fractures, open wounds,

47
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,140
soft tissue or
bony infections,

48
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,580
abscesses, DVT,

49
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,020
coagulopathy,

50
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,840
neoplasm, or directly
performing soft

51
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,260
tissue over a site
of recent operation.

52
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,100
HVLA is a passive
and direct

53
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,040
technique.
Accurate diagnosis,

54
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:36,060
proper patient selection
and correct technique

55
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,180
are key to successfully
performing hvla

56
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:44,880
as a general principle
of hvla first you will

57
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,620
identify a restricted
segment second prior

58
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,460
to any hvla treatment
always utilize a form

59
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:57,800
of soft tissue third
you will localize

60
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,960
precisely to the restrictive
barrier, and then

61
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,840
apply a quick, which
is your high velocity,

62
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,140
and your thrust, which
is low amplitude force,

63
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,220
directed to move
the joint past the

64
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:13,600
restrictive barrier, and
of course, it wouldn't

65
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,980
be a complete treatment
without reassessing.

66
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:22,260
Absolute contraindications
to HVLA include

67
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,620
no somatic dysfunction,
no consent,

68
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,960
patient intolerance,

69
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,460
osteoporosis,

70
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,960
osteomyelitis,

71
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,300
fractures,

72
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,720
bone cancers,

73
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,620
any hardware in
the joint, and

74
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,340
severe rheumatoid
arthritis.

75
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:41,490
Relative
contraindications include

76
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:44,980
acute whiplash or any
acute lumbar pain,

77
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,360
pregnancy,

78
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,580
post-surgical
complications,

79
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,420
herniated discs,
and anticoagulant

80
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,060
or blood thinner use.

81
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,800
For a type 1 or neutral

82
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,020
somatic dysfunction,

83
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,320
we would be using
a long lever with a

84
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,880
rotational and side
bending emphasis. So for

85
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,960
example, if we're
treating L5, neutral,

86
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,400
side bent left, and
rotated right, the

87
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,220
patient lies in the
right lateral recumbent

88
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,880
position with the
physician standing at

89
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,480
the side of the table
facing the patient.

90
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,200
The physician palpates
between the spinous

91
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:32,880
processes of L5 and
S1 and flexes the

92
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,360
patient's knees and
hips until L5 is in

93
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,400
a neutral position
relative to S1. The

94
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,440
physician further
positions the patient's

95
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,880
left leg so that it
drops over the side

96
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,600
of the table cephalad
to the right leg.

97
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,840
The patient's foot must

98
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,980
not touch the floor.

99
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:56,780
While continuing
to palpate L5, the

100
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,580
physician places the
cephalad hand in the

101
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:03,300
patient's left antecubital
fossa while resting

102
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,280
the forearm gently
on the patient's

103
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,400
anterior, pectoral,
and shoulder region.

104
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,840
The physician places
the caudad forearm

105
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,200
along a line between
the patient's left PSIS

106
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:20,100
and greater trochanter.
The patient's pelvis

107
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,300
is rotated anteriorly
to the edge of the

108
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,780
restrictive barrier and
the patient's shoulder

109
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:30,070
and thoracic spine are
rotated posteriorly

110
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,050
to the edge of the
restricted barrier.

111
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,980
The patient inhales
and exhales,

112
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,700
and during
exhalation, further

113
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,640
rotational slack
is taken up.

114
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:45,100
If the rotational
slack or motion barrier

115
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,920
is not effectively
met, the physician

116
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,460
can grasp the
patient's right arm,

117
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,680
drawing the shoulder
forward until rotational

118
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,940
movement is palpated
between L5 and S1.

119
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,260
With the patient
relaxed and not guarded,

120
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:03,500
the physician delivers
an impulse thrust with

121
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,400
a caudide forearm
directed at right angles

122
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,760
to the patient's spine
while simultaneously

123
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:12,260
moving the shoulder
slightly cephalad and

124
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:15,400
the pelvis and sacrum
caudide to impart side

125
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,640
bending right and
rotational left movement

126
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:22,140
effectiveness of the
technique is determined

127
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:24,900
by reassessing the
intersegmental motion

128
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,300
at the level of the
dysfunctional segment

129
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,640
here are the
images of the

130
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,380
technique that
we just described

131
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:40,500
for a type 2 non-neutral
somatic dysfunction

132
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,240
we will be using
a long lever with

133
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,440
rotational and side
bending emphasis for

134
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,260
example if we are
treating l4 flexed

135
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:53,600
rotated right and side
bent right, the patient

136
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,980
lies in the right
lateral recumbent

137
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,220
position with the
physician standing at

138
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,260
the side of the table
facing the patient.

139
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,440
The physician
palpates between the

140
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,300
spinous processes of
L4 and L5 and flexes

141
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,500
the patient's knees
and hips until L4 is

142
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,580
in a neutral position
relative to L5.

143
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:17,620
The physician further
positions the patient's

144
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:20,500
left leg so that it
drops over the side

145
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,060
of the table, cephalad
to the right leg.

146
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,260
The patient's foot must

147
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,340
not touch the floor.

148
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,220
While continuing
to palpate L4, the

149
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:33,580
physician places
the cephalad hand in

150
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,740
the antecubital fossa
of the patient's

151
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:38,060
left arm while
resting the forearm

152
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,800
gently on the
patient's shoulder.

153
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,820
The physician's caudad
hand stabilizes L5.

154
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,900
The patient's
shoulder and pelvis

155
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,100
are axially
rotated in opposite

156
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:52,160
directions. The
patient inhales and

157
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,700
exhales, and
during exhalation,

158
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,160
further rotational
slack is taken up.

159
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,900
If the rotational
slack or motion barrier

160
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,320
is not effectively
met, the physician

161
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,420
can grasp the patient's
right arm, drawing

162
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,760
the shoulder forward
until rotational

163
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,160
movement is palpated
between L4 and L5.

164
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:15,100
With the patient
relaxed and not

165
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,620
guarded, the physician
delivers an impulse

166
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,500
with the forearms
simultaneously

167
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,340
moving the shoulder
slightly caudate

168
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,720
and the pelvis and
sacrum cephalide.

169
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,780
Effectiveness of the
technique is determined

170
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,980
by reassessing
intersegmental motion

171
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:33,580
at the level of the
dysfunctional segment.

172
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,580
Here is the image of the

173
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,220
technique we
just described.

174
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,460
Moving on to our
counter strain

175
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,980
techniques.
Counter strain is a

176
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,860
passive and
indirect technique.

177
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,340
Counter strain points
are also called

178
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,300
tender points and
they are discrete

179
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,620
areas of tissue

abnormal neurologic
and or vascular

189
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,080

and exacerbation
of potentially life

191
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,300
-threatening symptoms
by treatment position.

192
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,020
Relative
contraindications include

193
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:39,620
patients who cannot
voluntarily relax,

194
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,600
severely ill patients,

195
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,860
upper cervical
hyperrotation and

196
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,380
hyperextension in
patients with known

197
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:50,960
vertebral artery disease
and or upper cervical

198
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:56,180
ligament instability,
inability to

199
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,260
tolerate classic
treatment position,

200
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,700
inability to
effectively communicate,

201
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:04,260
severe acute
rheumatological flares,

202
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,440
and any signs of
apprehension while

203
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,180
approaching the
treatment positions.

204
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:14,920
Here are our posterior
lumbar counter strain

205
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:19,900
points. We have tender
points PL1 to PL5

206
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:23,620
on the spinous processes
which are located

207
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:27,400
on the inferolateral
aspect of the spinous

208
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,480
process at the dysfunctional
segment to treat

209
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,480
these tender points
the patient is prone

210
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,260
you will extend to the
spinal level by lifting

211
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,380
the asis on the side
of the tender point

212
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:45,860
which also rotates the
pelvis and the lower

213
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:49,160
segment toward and the
upper segment away,

214
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,700
you will side
bend away by

215
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,340
adducting the
lower extremity.

216
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,240
For tender points, PL1
to PL5 on the transverse

217
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,860
processes, the
tender point would be

218
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:06,540
located on the
posterolateral aspect of the

219
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:09,100
dysfunctional
segment. The treatment

220
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,780
position will be the
same as noted previously.

221
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,020
Here are the images
of the counter

222
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,900
strain points we
just discussed.

223
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,300
And that
concludes the mini

224
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,420
lecture for this
lab. Thank you.
