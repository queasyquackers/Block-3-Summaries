1
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:04,350
This is part
three of the FOM

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,630
lecture on head and
neck embryology.

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,810
In this last section,
we're going to be

4
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:11,350
talking about germ
layer contributions

5
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:13,770
to various head and
neck structures.

6
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:18,590
So there are three
major germ layers in the

7
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:20,970
body. So these are
ectoderm, mesoderm, and

8
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,650
endoderm, same as other
parts of the body.

9
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,230
And in the ectoderm, in

10
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:27,550
addition to
the epidermis,

11
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:31,910
the ectoderm leads
to the creation of

12
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:34,330
the brain and the
cranial nerves. And

13
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,290
these are because
it is derived from

14
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:40,190
this neural tube, which
is going to become

15
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,150
both the brain and
the spinal cord.

16
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:45,790
You also have placodes
that are derived from

17
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:48,470
ectoderm, as we talked
about in the previous

18
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:50,810
part of the lecture.
And these are

19
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:53,150
associated with some of
the special senses in

20
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:55,250
the head and neck,
including the eye lens,

21
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,530
vestidial and
cochlea in the

22
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:59,070
inner ear and
nasal cavity.

23
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:02,090
And ectoderm is
also responsible

24
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:04,430
for generating
parotid gland.

25
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:10,090
Moving on to the
mesoderm, as expected,

26
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:12,610
these form the bones and
cartilaginous tissues,

27
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:15,130
arteries, and muscles.
And in the head,

28
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:17,550
a lot of these are
coming from pharyngeal

29
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:19,770
structures. Remember
the pharyngeal arches.

30
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,370
And the funny thing
about in the head is

31
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:25,910
that these mesodermal
tissues will interact

32
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:28,750
with what's called
neocrest cells, which

33
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:29,870
we'll be talking
about in the next

34
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:33,030
section. But neocrest
cells are ectodermally

35
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:37,170
derived, a very special
set of cells that

36
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,970
can kind of go from
ectoderm into cell

37
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,690
populations that kind
of act like mesoderm.

38
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:48,650
And then you also have
the skull, which is

39
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:53,350
part of the bone and
cartilaginous tissues

40
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,350
in the head. So
that's derived from

41
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:58,450
mesoderm as well. And
then endoderm, you have

42
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:00,410
the glandular tissues,
except for the

43
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:03,430
parotid gland, and then
the mucosae around the

44
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:06,590
oral and the nasal
cavities and beyond.

45
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:12,910
so i promise that
i'll be talking about

46
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:16,150
neurocrest cells so
neurocrest cells are

47
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,170
populations of cells
that originate in

48
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:20,710
the neural fold so
recall in earlier

49
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,290
embryonic lectures
that you have an

50
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:25,910
ectodermal layer in very
early embryonic stage

51
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:32,390
and the ectodermal
layer is going to

52
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:38,690
invaginate and then
is going to split off

53
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:41,260
and that split off part
is going to form a tube

54
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,270
and called neurotube
and this is what's

55
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,410
going to become the
brain and the spinal cord

56
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:47,990
and what you're
also left with

57
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:50,010
is this continuous
ectodermal

58
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:51,410
layer which is
going to later

59
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,410
produce the epidermis
but then during this

60
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:59,700
invagination process
there's a region

61
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,430
that's folded. And
this is called a neural

62
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:04,790
fold. And from there
emerges these very

63
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:07,650
special populations
of multi-potent cells

64
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:12,590
called neurocrest
cells. And neurocrest

65
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:16,090
cells are, again,
ectodermally derived,

66
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:19,950
but forms secondary
mesenchyme. So these

67
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,950
are mesoderm-like
structures. They act

68
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:26,290
like although they
came out of ectoderm.

69
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:29,890
And these neurocrest
cells migrate all

70
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:33,290
over the body to
turn into a wonderful

71
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:35,310
array of different
tissues. So these

72
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:38,230
include cartilage
and bone, teeth,

73
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:41,730
skin, melanocytes,
smooth muscles,

74
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:44,810
glands, adipose
tissue, neurons, glia,

75
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,130
adrenal medulla,

76
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:49,870
et cetera. And it's
responsible for most

77
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,830
of the connective and
the skeletal tissue

78
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:54,510
of the head, nerves,
and pigment cells.

79
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,110
And here are the
derivatives of the

80
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,010
neurocrest cells in
the head and neck

81
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:02,330
in all its glory.
So in terms of

82
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:05,130
cartilage and bone,
it forms most of

83
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:07,150
the bones and
cartilage in the head.

84
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:09,590
So these include
the facial bones,

85
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:12,550
which are listed
here, as well

86
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,290
as some in the
cranial base,

87
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:16,090
including parts of
the sphenoid bone.

88
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:18,570
And it also forms
all three of

89
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:19,810
the middle your
ossicles, the

90
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,570
malleus, incus,
and stapes,

91
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:24,030
hyoid, and the
laryngeal cartilage.

92
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,950
So these are all
cartilage and bony

93
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,410
structures that
are derived from

94
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:30,290
pharyngeal arches
from part one of this

95
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:32,770
lecture on head and
neck embryology.

96
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:38,170
In the same way, for
the nervous system

97
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:40,750
derivatives, it includes
sensory ganglia of

98
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,930
cranial nerve 5, 7,
9, and 10, which are

99
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:46,270
branchiomeric nerves. So
these are cranial nerves

100
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,730
that are associated
with pharyngeal arches.

101
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,630
And it also includes

102
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,930
their peripheral nerves.

103
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:58,090
And for the muscles,
so the neocrest cells

104
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:01,810
do not directly become
muscles, but they

105
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:04,070
interact with the
mesoderms in the

106
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:07,050
pharyngeal arches to
form the muscles of the

107
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:10,510
head and neck, including
the jaw muscles.

108
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,610
And then there
are other key

109
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:15,210
structures that
come from neocrest

110
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:16,890
cells. So these
include teeth,

111
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:18,970
particularly the dentine

112
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,870
component of it,
but not enamel.

113
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:24,810
It also forms dermis
and hyperdermis of the

114
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:28,050
face and the neck,
creates the choroid and

115
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:30,810
sclera of the eye,
and melanocytes in the

116
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:33,350
iris, as well as the
rest of the body. So if

117
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,330
you think that someone's
eyes and their eye

118
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:37,910
color is beautiful, you
can thank neurocrest

119
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:41,430
cells. And it's also
responsible for developing

120
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:44,630
meninges and connective
tissues of lacrimal

121
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:47,010
salivary and thymus
clads not the glandular

122
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:48,670
tissues themselves
but the connective

123
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:52,490
tissues surrounding
them and now what's

124
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:56,150
interesting is so neurocrest
cells have all these

125
00:05:56,150 --> 00:06:00,770
different kinds of
derivatives so there have

126
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:03,570
been a lot of research
on why we have so

127
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:06,430
many dog breeds and one
of the secrets could

128
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:09,030
be related to neurocrest
cells and that's

129
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:11,350
been demonstrated for
some of the attributes.

130
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:13,190
So for example, if you
look across different

131
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:16,970
dog breeds, you definitely
see quite different

132
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:19,110
and varying skull
shapes. For example,

133
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:21,430
looking at husky skill
and chihuahua skull.

134
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:24,050
And then obviously
dog breeds are

135
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,210
known for the
differences in fur color.

136
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:30,350
And what is the cause
or what are responsible

137
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:32,170
for some of these
traits? Well, it all

138
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:34,350
goes back to neurocrest
cells. So there

139
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:37,350
must've been
artificial selection on

140
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,630
neurocrest cells that
produced all these

141
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:42,990
coordinated changes very
quickly historically.

142
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,710
Now, we're going
to end it talking

143
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,950
about clinical
correlates related to

144
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,750
neurocrest cells.
And so one of them

145
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,470
is called Treacher
-Collins syndrome,

146
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:58,170
and it's caused by
genetic disorder that

147
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:01,070
involves faulty
migration of neurocrest

148
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:03,390
cells in the head
in the pharyngeal

149
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:07,310
arches one and two
and occurs about one

150
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:10,450
in 50,000 births.
And so the symptoms

151
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:13,130
or the syndrome
includes hearing loss,

152
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,670
downturned eyes,

153
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:17,190
underdevelopment
of the midface,

154
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:21,030
micronathia or a small
lower jaw and cleft

155
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:23,570
palate. So these
are all coordinated

156
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:28,070
traits that neurocrest
cell controls, especially

157
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:30,730
the development of
the facial bones.

158
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:34,510
So Treacher-Collin
syndrome is the result

159
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:37,690
of faulty migration
of neurocrest cells.

160
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:44,990
So let's end it with
an example question.

161
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:47,250
So a six-year-old
girl exhibits a

162
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,090
swelling in the anterior
part of her neck,

163
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:51,390
just inferior to the
thyroid bone. Which

164
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,310
of the following may
explain a swelling?

165
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:55,930
So in this question,
think about

166
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:59,090
the location of
the opening. Is

167
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:00,650
it on the midline
of the neck or

168
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:03,110
the lateral aspect
of the neck? So

169
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:14,650
the answer is C, which

170
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:16,970
is associated with the

171
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:21,730
thyroglossal duct cyst.
So if the swelling

172
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:23,630
or opening was
associated with the

173
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,590
lateral part of the
neck, then it would

174
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:28,450
have been the intact
cervical sinus.

175
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,530
And the obliteration
of the cervical

176
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:34,340
sinus, which is answer
B, which this is just

177
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,310
part of normal
development. So this

178
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:39,530
would not lead to any
particular swelling.

179
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:42,290
And then obliteration
of thytoglossal

180
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:44,790
ducts, similarly is
what happens under

181
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,270
typical development.
And then incomplete

182
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,670
closure of
secondary palate is

183
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:51,250
something that would
cause cleft palate.

184
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:55,450
So a totally different
kind of condition.

185
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,790
So together with the
previous lecture on

186
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,610
introduction to the
head and neck, I hope

187
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:04,690
I've convinced you
that the head and

188
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:07,310
the neck that supports
it is a truly special

189
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,990
and wonderfully
complex region. I know

190
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:14,390
it's a difficult
and very complicated

191
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:16,830
area of the body,
but I also hope that

192
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:19,570
you enjoy and appreciate
this complexity.

193
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:23,170
So just to finish
up this lecture,

194
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:25,730
These are the
topics that I

195
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:27,750
recommend you
focusing on in

196
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,370
your preparation
for the exams.

197
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,310
So first, make
sure you know the

198
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:33,790
derivatives of the
pharyngeal arches, pouches,

199
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,230
clefts, and
membranes. So complete

200
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:37,510
that table and study
off of that table.

201
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:40,250
Development of the
face, skull, palate,

202
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,370
tongue, thyroid
gland, placos,

203
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:44,350
and the pituitary
gland. Make sure you

204
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:48,550
understand the
process involved in

205
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:49,950
the development of
these structures.

206
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,890
And then the germ layer
and the neurocrestal

207
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:54,730
origins of the head
and neck structures.

208
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,630
And then, of
course, the clinical

209
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,570
implications
that arise from

210
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:00,630
abnormalities in head
and neck development

211
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:02,030
that I covered
in the lectures.

212
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,990
This is the end
of the FOM lecture

213
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:08,070
on the head and
neck embryology.

214
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:10,130
And I'd be grateful
if you can provide

215
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:11,930
