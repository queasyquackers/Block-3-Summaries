00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,560
Or Smell and Taste
The following three

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,240
videos provide
a summary of the

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,280
special senses for
the head and neck.

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,880
Much of this information
is distilled from

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,200
chapters 8 and 10 of
Moore's Clinically

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,880
Oriented Anatomy. As
with previous lecture

9
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,160
videos, I recommend
focusing on the blue

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,080
pages slash blue boxes
in these chapters as

11
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,400
they will contain
the most clinically

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,840
relevant information
about these structures.

13
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,320
This lecture video
series completes our

14
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,940
trek through the 12
cranial nerves. We will

15
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,020
cover cranial nerves
1, 2, and 8, with brief

16
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,540
cameos from cranial
nerves 7, 9, and 10.

17
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,300
Today's video
covers the two most

18
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,680
underrepresented
senses in our body,

19
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,960
starting with cranial
nerve 1, olfactory.

20
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,520
This is the least
researched cranial

21
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,920
nerve, and the one
that is the least

22
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,560
valued in everyday
life. Humans just

23
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,400
don't emphasize
our sense of smell.

24
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,120
The structure
typically referred

25
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,880
to as the
olfactory nerve is

26
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,700
in fact the
olfactory stalk.

27
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,860
This structure is
comprised of the

28
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,420
olfactory tract
and olfactory bulb.

29
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:14,020
The olfactory nerve
is not a true nerve.

30
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,760
These structures
are anterior

31
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,040
extensions of the
forebrain that end in

32
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,180
multiple little
terminal nerves.

33
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,580
This is the human
olfactory bulb. Compared

34
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,260
to other animals
such as rats, dogs,

35
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,560
alligators, or even
dinosaurs such as

36
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,720
Tyrannosaurus rex,
it's pretty clear just

37
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,840
how much humans have
reduced our sense

38
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,700
of smell. The olfactory
bulbs rest above

39
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,720
the cribriform plate
of endocranium.

40
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:40,900
From the olfactory
bulbs, 10 or so nerves

41
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,420
descend down through
the cribriform plate of

42
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,980
the ethmoid bone. The
nerves traverse the

43
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,440
cheese-grater-like
cribriform plate until they

44
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,500
reach their destination
in the mucosa of the

45
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,000
superior-most portion
of the nasal passage.

46
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,680
Although we often
associate the nasal

47
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,160
passage with the
sense of smell,

48
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,620
only the superior
-most portion of the

49
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,060
nasal passage—a
relatively small part of

50
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,760
the entire nasal
passage—is capable of

51
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,420
olfaction. The remainder
of the nasal passage

52
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:10,020
is used to filter,
warm, and humidify

53
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,980
air before it enters
the lungs, and then

54
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,940
to reclaim that
water on the way out.

55
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:16,680
The three internal
swellings we see in

56
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,600
the nasal passage
are called conchi.

57
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,560
They are named
for their shape,

58
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,040
which resembles
a conch or conch.

59
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,340
Think of a conch
shell on the beach.

60
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,940
Only the superior
concha houses

61
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,600
olfactory epithelium.
This epithelium

62
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,580
extends over the
superior concha

63
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,820
and the adjoining
medial nasal wall.

64
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,280
This is where the
olfactory nerves end.

65
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,860
Formation of the
superior concha is

66
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,840
variable, with some
people not having

67
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,120
a superior concha
at all. Instead,

68
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,680
the olfactory nerves
are distributed

69
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,460
over the roof of
the nasal passage.

70
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,120
Air entering the
superior concal

71
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,800
portion of the
airway, referred

72
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,830
to as the
superior meatus,

73
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,400
slowly traverses the
olfactory epithelium.

74
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,420
Odorant molecules
get captured by the

75
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,500
olfactory mucosa,
transporting the

76
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,020
molecules to olfactory
receptor cells.

77
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,100
This triggers the
cells, depolarizing them

78
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,800
and sending the signal
back through the

79
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,760
cribriform plate and
into the olfactory

80
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,120
bulb where they synapse
with another specialized

81
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,840
group of cells,
called mitral cells.

82
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,900
These cells send
the olfactory signal

83
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,880
back to the rest of
the brain along two

84
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,840
different olfactory
striae, a lateral

85
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,440
and a medial stria.
The olfactory nerve

86
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,440
is the only cranial
nerve that directly

87
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,380
connects to the
cerebrum. All other

88
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,540
cranial nerves connect
from the brainstem.

89
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,080
Clinical correlate.
The most common

90
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,140
clinical case related
to the olfactory system

91
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,720
is anosmia, or the
inability to smell.

92
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,240
Anosmia can be
acquired from multiple

93
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,960
sources, including
damage to the

94
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,980
olfactory epithelium
itself or the

95
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,780
cribriform plate. In
many instances, there

96
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,600
is a congenital
component involved.

97
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,300
This pathology has
received more attention

98
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,040
recently, as anosmia
used to be a hallmark

99
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,940
of early variants of
the COVID-19 infection.

100
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,560
Anosmia largely affects
a person's quality

101
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,160
of life. People with
anosmia will comment on

102
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,740
food being less
appetizing. This is due to

103
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,600
the intimate connection
between smell and

104
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,040
taste, which we will
cover later in the video.

105
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,160
People suffering
from anosmia may find

106
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,940
themselves in urgent
care more often

107
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,000
due to accidental
food poisoning as the

108
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,920
lack of smell
receptors prevents them

109
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,340
from recognizing when
food has spoiled.

110
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,180
The second special
afferent in

111
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,920
this video is
taste, or gustation.

112
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:32,480
Taste is unique as it
is the only special

113
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,600
afferent to span
multiple cranial

114
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,940
nerves. The sense of
taste is conveyed to

115
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,740
the brain on cranial
nerves 7, 9, and 10.

116
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,660
Taste is the ability
to recognize chemical

117
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,940
signatures on items
that touch the tongue,

118
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:48,120
which is the main organ
for taste sensation.

119
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,700
The capacity to
taste also exists

120
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,880
on part of the oral
soft palate and

121
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,840
pharynx, but
these all pale in

122
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,160
comparison to what
we see on the tongue.

123
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,760
Gustation on the
tongue is made possible

124
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,840
due to numerous ridges
on the surface and

125
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,240
sides of the tongue
mucosa. These ridges

126
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,240
are called lingual
papillae. There are

127
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,240
four types of lingual
papillae, filiform,

128
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,500
foliate, fungiform,
and circumvalate.

129
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,440
Circumvalate papillae

130
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,700
are the least numerous,

131
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,320
with the typical
person having between

132
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,220
8 and 12 papillae.
In contrast,

133
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,160
filiform papillae
are extremely

134
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,520
numerous and cover
most of the tongue.

135
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,980
However, filiform
papillae are

136
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,600
also the only
lingual papillae

137
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,700
that lack taste
receptor cells.

138
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,540
Instead, these
papillae function in

139
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,740
gripping food items
with the tongue. The

140
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,420
taste-sensing
structures on the other

141
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:42,140
three papillae are
called taste buds.

142
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,740
Taste buds are a
collection of afferent

143
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,780
neurons that come
together to form a single

144
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,520
taste-sensing structure.
Each taste bud

145
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,680
has between 50 to
150 taste receptor

146
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,900
cells bundled together
to form a structure

147
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,160
that looks a bit like
a hand of bananas.

148
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,260
A single lingual papilla
may have hundreds

149
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,760
of taste buds across
its surface. There

150
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,160
are five recognized
taste categories.

151
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,320
Sweet, salty,
sour, bitter,

152
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,280
and umami, or savory.

153
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,280
Hold up a minute.
What about spicy food?

154
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:15,060
That's a taste, isn't it?

155
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:18,440
Though we often
associate spiciness with

156
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,440
food flavors, spice
is not a true taste.

157
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,780
There are no spice
receptors on the tongue.

158
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,820
Instead, spice
is conveyed back

159
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,360
to the brain
via these guys,

160
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,980
our nosoceptors.

161
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,620
Nosoceptors are our
pain receptor cells.

162
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,280
Spices, typically
from capsaicin,

163
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,820
irritate our mucosal
lining, and that pain

164
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,160
is relayed back to
the brain via our

165
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,880
nosoceptors. In
particular, our thermal

166
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:48,080
nosoceptors, hence why
spicy food feels hot.

167
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,640
The unique way
that individuals

168
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,840
interpret this pain
is what determines

169
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,820
a person's
spice tolerance.

170
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,000
This is also why you
can taste with your

171
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,220
eyes, nose, genitalia,
and **** region.

172
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,120
Theoretically, any
part of our body

173
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,620
that has nosocceptors
can taste spicy

174
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,680
food, though this
is often limited

175
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,280
to just parts that
contain mucosa.

176
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,540
So, not a true
taste category, but

177
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:16,360
still a fascinating
phenomenon. Alright,

178
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,780
back to taste buds.

179
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:23,580
Taste receptor cells
are sensitive to only

180
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,160
one of the five taste
types mentioned here.

181
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,400
However, the
distribution of taste

182
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,260
receptors within even a
single taste bud is such

183
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,600
that every part of
the tongue mucosa can

184
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,420
taste any of these
five taste categories.

185
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,500
Different nerves
convey taste to the

186
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,120
brain from different
parts of the tongue.

187
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,380
The posterior one
-third of the tongue

188
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,880
uses the glossopharyngeal
nerve, cranial

189
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,180
nerve 9, to convey
taste information.

190
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:51,220
A small portion of
the posterior part

191
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,120
of the tongue, as
well as bits of the

192
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,480
oral soft palate and
pharynx, have their

193
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,200
taste information
conveyed to the brain

194
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,520
via the vagus nerve,
cranial nerve 10.

195
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,640
By far the largest
contributor to gustation

196
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,400
is the facial nerve.
This nerve conveys

197
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,060
taste information to
the brain from the

198
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:10,380
anterior two-thirds of
the tongue via a special

199
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,820
branch of facial
called corda tympani.

200
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,280
We briefly covered
the course of

201
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,220
corda tympani in my
previous lecture.

202
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,280
The nerve travels
through the middle

203
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,480
ear cavity and
exits the skull

204
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,560
through the petro
-tympanic fissure.

205
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,360
From here, corda
tympani hitches a

206
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,060
ride with the lingual
nerve, cranial

207
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:30,280
nerve 5-3, to
reach the tongue.

208
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:32,560
As with the hypoglossal
nerve and the

209
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,420
cervical plexus,
even though both

210
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,540
lingual and
chordotimpany appear like

211
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,140
a single nerve at
this point, their

212
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,520
two epineural sheaths
remain separate.

213
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,180
So why is the
tongue this rich

214
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,020
tapestry of nerve
associations?

215
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,100
The answer has
everything to do with

216
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,030
how our tongue forms
embryologically.

217
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,260
The tongue starts
in the fourth

218
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,980
week as a series
of swellings from

219
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,980
the first four
pharyngeal arches.

220
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,800
Each pharyngeal arch
has a specific nerve

221
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,720
associated with it. As
the tongue develops,

222
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,440
it drags in contributions
from these four

223
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,660
different cranial
nerves. In the case

224
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,900
of chordotimpani, we can
see that the anterior

225
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,940
two-thirds of the
fully developed tongue

226
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:13,580
are covered by
trigeminal, not facial.

227
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,080
However, earlier
in development, the

228
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,700
facial nerve's
distribution was more

229
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,100
present thanks to
contributions of pharyngeal

230
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,140
arch 2 to the
developing tongue.

231
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,920
During this time, our
protochordotimpani

232
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,600
nerve splits off from
the protofacial nerve as

233
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,900
the pharyngeal arch
swellings are dragged,

234
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,060
the first pharyngeal

235
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,080
arch as the tongue forms.

236
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,700
Clinical correlate.
Taste is second only

237
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,340
to olfaction when
it comes to under

238
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,060
-representation in
medicine and research. The

239
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,860
biggest clinical
correlate associated with

240
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:46,160
gustation is agusia.
This is a loss of the

241
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,020
sense of taste, and
it often goes hand in

242
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,920
hand with anosmia.
Agusia has also seen a

243
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,260
relatively recent surge
in interest, as loss

244
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,460
of taste was another
factor commonly

245
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:58,140
associated with early
strains of a COVID-19

246
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,940
infection. Other ways
of acquiring agusia

247
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,780
include exposure to
toxic chemicals, illicit

248
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:06,200
drug use, or head
trauma, which can cause

249
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,780
a temporary or
permanent loss of taste.

250
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,520
The loss of a sense
of taste, as with the

251
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,480
loss of sense of smell,
can place a person

252
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,660
at risk for inadvertent
food poisoning as

253
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,940
they cannot taste food
that has gone bad.

254
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:20,880
Largely, agusia affects
the quality of life

255
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,840
for the patient as
the inability to taste

256
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,420
lowers hunger levels
and often leads to poor

257
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,420
nutrition as the
affected person may try

258
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,300
to compensate for a
weakened gustation by

259
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,640
substituting more salt
or sugar into their

260
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,680
food. Much like anosmia,
there are currently

261
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,540
few treatment options
available for agusia.

262
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,580
Smell and taste are
deeply intertwined

263
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,580
with one another. They
offer two different

264
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,380
means of analyzing
chemicals from

265
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:48,040
the environment, or
chemosensation. They

266
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,420
are also an example
of a coupled sense.

267
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,920
Coupled senses are
two or more senses

268
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,900
that work together
to perform a third

269
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,560
function. For olfaction
and gustation,

270
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,600
that third function is
the concept of flavor.

271
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,080
Although we typically
associate flavor with

272
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,020
just taste, true flavor
requires both the

273
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:08,900
sense of smell and the
sense of taste. It has

274
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,520
often been stated that
80% of flavor comes

275
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,040
from just the smell of
food alone, though as

276
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,040
far as I know there are
no real quantitative

277
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,360
measures behind that
statement. The importance

278
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,200
of smell in the
flavor of food can be

279
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,960
made obvious when a
person suffers from a

280
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,240
stuffy nose. Food eaten
during this time is often

281
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,540
considered bland and
pretty flavorless.

282
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,900
If you have used air
travel recently, then you

283
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,860
may have also noticed
that airplane food

284
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,840
is remarkably bland
despite its high salt and

285
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,500
sugar content. The
high altitude and heavy

286
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,860
air recirculation in
airplanes lowers the

287
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,560
ability to detect airborne
odorants, producing

288
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,680
a weakened sense of
flavor. You can test this

289
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,340
the next time you take
a trip on a flight

290
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,660
by holding on to some of
the snack food offered

291
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,880
to you on the plane
and tasting it some

292
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,620
10 to 20 minutes after
you have landed and

293
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:57,200
resettled your body.
The now grounded snack

294
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,540
items should taste
noticeably sweeter or saltier

295
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:03,260
compared to their
taste on the plane. The

296
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,460
coupling of smell and
taste occurs at multiple

297
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,120
sites of integration
in the brain,

298
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,880
including the thalamus
and orbitofrontal cortex.

299
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,800
You will learn more
about these structures

300
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,630
in neuroanatomy
next semester.

301
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:16,690
This brings us to
the end of video one.
