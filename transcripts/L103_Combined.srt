1
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:03,740
This is an FOM
lecture on the

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:04,980
introduction
to the head and

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,240
neck given by
Dr. Aki Watanabe.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,500
My job today is to
convince you that the

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,780
head and the neck that
supports it is a truly

6
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:17,680
special region. And
why is that? Well, if

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,540
you look across different
animals, so here

8
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:22,480
we have a dinosaur,
human, and a gorilla.

9
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,120
And when you
pay attention

10
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,880
to the post
cranial skeleton,

11
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,270
you can see that a lot
of the appendicular

12
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:31,840
and the axial
skeletons remain pretty

13
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,740
similar across the
different species. But when

14
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,440
you pay attention
to the head, this is

15
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,400
where you see remarkable
variation in form.

16
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,200
Perhaps more relevant
to what you're doing,

17
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,700
which is going
through med school and

18
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,140
becoming physicians,
is that the head is in

19
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,400
a primary way that you
establish communication

20
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,820
and a connection
with your patients.

21
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,860
So head and the
neck that supports

22
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,520
it is indeed a
special region.

23
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:03,200
so in today's lecture
it will be divided into

24
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,820
three parts so the
first part will cover

25
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,880
the head and neck
architecture or the lay of

26
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,440
the land of the head
and neck and then in

27
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,440
the second part we'll
cover the special senses

28
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,660
and organs that exist
only in the head

29
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,080
and the neck and then
we'll end this lecture

30
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,120
by covering the cranial
nerves and giving an

31
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,200
introductory overview
of these wonderfully

32
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,580
complex and multifunctional
set of nerves.

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,200
So before we move on
to the lecture content,

34
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,420
I wanted to go over
some of the basic

35
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,480
guidelines that my
lectures will follow.

36
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,840
So any red text on
slides means that

37
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,060
you need to know for
the exams. Similarly,

38
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,860
anatomical structures
that are labeled

39
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,880
in different figures
in red or in red

40
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,520
highlights are also
fair game for the exams.

41
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,440
and then make sure
to pay attention to

42
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,140
the clinical
correlates. These are

43
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,340
what you would call
high yield topics.

44
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,260
And then lastly, as
a general advice,

45
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,240
go over the
learning objectives

46
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,960
listed in the
course preparation

47
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,340
guide for these lectures.

48
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:08,260
So let's start with a
little review. So the

49
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:11,100
neck serves as a
conduit between the head

50
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,440
and basically the rest
of the body that we've

51
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,940
already covered. So
these include the

52
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,520
thorax, upper limb,
and the back. So it has

53
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,120
various structures that
go in and out, a lot

54
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,700
of them that you've
already covered. So here

55
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,480
you can pause the
video and think about

56
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,140
the different vessels,
nerves, and other

57
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,980
structures that go
through the head and neck.

58
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:41,430
Hopefully you were
able to identify some

59
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,130
of these important
structures. So let's start

60
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,150
with the nerves. So
we have the vagus

61
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,470
nerve and the brachial
plexus, which you

62
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,590
learned previously. And
then you also have the

63
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,830
vessels that you're
also fairly familiar

64
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:53,350
with at this point.
So you have the common

65
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:56,230
carotid artery and
internal jugular vein.

66
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,890
And then you
also have other

67
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:59,850
structures like the
cervical vertebrae

68
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:02,570
and esophagus
and the trachea.

69
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,060
So let's talk about
the skeletal system

70
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,340
in the head and
neck. So we have

71
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,740
the skull, which
is pretty obvious

72
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:15,060
structure, but please
keep in mind that

73
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:18,900
skull includes both
the cranium and

74
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,640
the mandible, which
forms a lower jaw.

75
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,580
And you also have
the hyoid, which

76
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,380
is a U-shaped
bone. It's a unique

77
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,620
structure where it's
a bone that doesn't

78
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,300
articulate or
connect with another

79
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,620
bone, and it aids
in swallowing.

80
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,280
You also have the
laryngeal cartilages,

81
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,140
which is a set of
cartilaginous tissues

82
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,360
that support the
voice box, which is

83
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,620
allowing me to talk
for this lecture.

84
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,480
focusing on the upper
part of the cervical

85
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,020
vertebral series you
have the atlas which

86
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:55,640
supports the skull
and the axis which

87
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:00,540
is the second cervical
vertebra or c2 and

88
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,560
so just to go over
some of the specific

89
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,680
structures on the
atlas or c1 there's the

90
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,840
superior articular
surface which is going

91
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,100
to connect with the
occipital condyles on

92
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,500
the underside of the
skull and the The

93
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,360
atlas will allow for
up and down motion. So

94
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,580
if you want to say yes
non-verbally to your

95
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:20,060
friends, then you
can thank the atlas.

96
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,640
And an axis has this
structure called a

97
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,280
dens, which means a
tooth. And this forms

98
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,300
a pivot that allows
the atlas to rotate.

99
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:32,420
So axis allows your
head to move in

100
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:36,860
sideways orientation.
So when you

101
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,840
want to say no to
things non-verbally,

102
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,000
you will be using
the axis. Yes.

103
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,180
Continuing on with the
skull. So the skull

104
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:49,520
looks like it's one
unit and functionally it

105
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:53,160
does serve as one unit,
but it's important

106
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,140
to know that it's
composed of 22 bones that

107
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:02,140
are fused together and
a couple or few middle

108
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:05,460
ear ossicles. So
ossicles mean tiny bones

109
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,700
and they sit in the
middle ear and they help

110
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:11,700
amplify the noise so
you can hear better.

111
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,920
And the skull is
split into two

112
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,660
different regions
or groupings. So

113
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,500
you have the
neurocranium, which

114
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,920
another word for it
is the brain case. And

115
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,880
as the name implies,
it houses the brain

116
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,440
and protects the
brain. And then you

117
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,180
have the visceral
cranium, which are

118
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:35,640
the bones that make
up the face and so

119
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,900
here are some of
the bones that you

120
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,320
need to know so you
have the frontal

121
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,700
which forms the kind of
the forehead parietal

122
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:49,300
bone temporal bone
zygomatic bone maxilla

123
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,800
and then you have
the mandible and

124
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:56,920
you can also try to
separate them and

125
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:00,100
this is called
exploded figure where

126
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,460
you can see sort
of the shape of

127
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,600
individual bones that
make up the skull.

128
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,880
So, so far, we've
just covered the adult

129
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,920
skull and the skeletal
system, but it's

130
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,300
important to know
that bones are living

131
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,200
tissue and that they
change throughout

132
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,840
development. So most
notably, in infants,

133
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:28,030
newborns, you have a
soft spot on the skull

134
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:30,890
called fontanelles. And
so these are fibrous,

135
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:37,120
soft tissues between
the cranial bones.

136
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,060
And so these sit in
between some of the

137
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,880
bones that we just
talked about. And these

138
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,620
fontanelles allow
movement among the

139
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,420
skull bones. And why
do you think that is?

140
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,000
Well, it has two
functions. So the first

141
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,700
function is that when
the baby is being born

142
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,120
and going through the
birth canal, it allows

143
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,300
the skull bones to
move around and even

144
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,980
go on top of each
other a little bit so

145
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:08,520
that the baby can be
born and the head can

146
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,600
fit through and go
through the birth canal.

147
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,400
The another reason
is these pontinelles

148
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,660
stay a little bit
longer after birth

149
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,740
to allow for the
growth of the brain.

150
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,930
And so there are
different types of

151
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:24,180
fontanelles. So here we
have labeled anterior

152
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,640
fontanelle, which sits
between the frontal

153
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,780
and parietal bones.
And this is the largest

154
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:31,120
fontanelle. And you
also have the lateral

155
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,320
fontanelles towards
the side of the

156
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,280
skull. And then you
also have the posterior

157
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,680
fontanelle between the
parietal and occipital

158
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,280
bones. So both the
lateral and the

159
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,760
posterior fontanelles,
they close up within

160
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,440
kind of few months of
the baby being born.

161
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:49,440
But then the anterior
fontanelle is going

162
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,580
to exist and remain
up until, you know,

163
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,780
year to year and a
half after birth.

164
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,500
So, you know, if
you're handling or, you

165
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,760
know, if you know a
baby and if you notice

166
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:06,120
a soft spot, as long
as it's, you know,

167
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,000
still there and the
baby is no older

168
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,140
than a year and a
half, there's nothing

169
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,940
to worry about. So
you can explain to the

170
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,800
parents that this is
totally normal. And

171
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,880
it's actually a good
thing that the baby

172
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,340
has these fontanelles
with soft spots.

173
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:25,720
And so I just alluded
to the fact that bone

174
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,440
is living tissue. And
then it's important

175
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,600
to know that there's
dynamism to the

176
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,380
scalpel system. So this
is no different with

177
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:38,160
the skull and
the mandible. So,

178
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:41,380
or sorry, the skull,
including the cranium

179
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:44,300
and the mandible.
and so on the left we

180
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:48,820
have an infant all the
way to a gerontic or

181
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:52,440
more senior individual
on the right and so

182
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,540
you have probably a
skull from a adolescent

183
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:00,840
individual and then
of course adult human

184
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,300
skull second from the
right so what you're

185
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:07,480
seeing here is that
the skull changes in

186
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,120
how it looks throughout
somebody's lifetime

187
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,340
so in the beginning
you tend to have these

188
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:16,140
rounded large orbits
or the eye socket

189
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:19,140
you also see this
anterior fontanelle here

190
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:23,500
and you obviously
start with no teeth and

191
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,500
then as you grow you
obviously gain more

192
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,620
teeth and the skull
becomes taller and then

193
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:35,080
after you know later
in adulthood or in in

194
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,620
more senior individuals,
the skull again

195
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,520
becomes more rounded
or globular, and you

196
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,630
also lose teeth. So
it's kind of poetic in

197
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:47,800
a sense that the older
individual tends to

198
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,980
start resembling an
infant later in life.

199
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:55,820
All right, now let's
move on from the

200
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,640
skeletal system and
talk about the nervous

201
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,360
system. So the
first thing I will

202
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,280
say is that the
brain anatomy will be

203
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,890
covered in detail
next semester in

204
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:06,940
neuroanatomy. So there's
not actually a lot

205
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,200
you need to know for
the nervous system.

206
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,650
One thing that I would
like to point out

207
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:13,760
is that the menisual
layers that you

208
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,360
learned previously,
so these are the dura

209
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,180
arachnoid and the pia
mater that you learned

210
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:22,220
that surrounds the
spine, spinal cord,

211
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,640
continues on into
the brain. And so you

212
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,780
still have the same
spaces. For example,

213
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:29,760
the subarachnoid
space contains a

214
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,760
cerebral spinal fluid.
And that's the same

215
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,040
thing that's happening
around the brain as

216
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,200
well. These are
continuous structures.

217
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,500
And in the brain, you
have other structures,

218
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,800
for example, the
choroid plexus that

219
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,860
generates and
produces the cerebral

220
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,580
spinal fluid. And then
you have these ventricles

221
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:49,180
and there's a set
of four of them

222
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:52,980
that are cavities where
the cerebral spinal

223
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,660
fluid flows through
within the brain.

224
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,300
Now let's move on
to talking about

225
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,380
ingestion and
respiration and structure

226
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,360
that are related
to these functions.

227
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,520
So in the head,
you have the GI

228
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,040
and respiratory
systems that are

229
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,300
connected through
the pharynx.

230
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,380
And first, you
have the nasal

231
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:20,660
cavity inside of
your nose, and

232
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,200
you also have
the oral cavity.

233
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:25,580
And these are separated
by the hard palate

234
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:28,750
and the soft palate,
so the fleshy

235
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:32,090
extension of the heart
palate posteriorly.

236
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:37,220
So what I want
you to do is

237
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,740
breathe in deeply
through your nose

238
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,740
and let's follow
the pathway of the

239
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:47,680
air. So the air,
when you do that, is

240
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,960
going to go through
the external

241
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:53,460
nonaris and then enter
the nasal cavity.

242
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,700
And then when
it passes the

243
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:59,520
internal nares,
then it has entered

244
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,740
a part called
nasopharynx.

245
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:07,280
And nasopharynx
ends at the uvula,

246
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,560
at the tip of
the soft palate.

247
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,350
And then beyond that
is the oropharynx,

248
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:14,900
which is posterior
to the oral cavity.

249
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,500
And then past the
epiglottis, this little

250
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,980
cover for the larynx
and the trachea, so

251
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,120
the food doesn't get
going through there,

252
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:28,080
that's a region called
a laryngopharynx.

253
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,380
So that's where it
starts up until the

254
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:34,040
esophagus or the
larynx. So the pharynx

255
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,360
is divided into three
parts, and these

256
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,220
are the boundaries
of those three parts.

257
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,420
So what we're going
to do is we talked

258
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,140
about how the air
moves from the

259
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:49,220
nasal cavity into
the trachea, but

260
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,920
let's just review
that pathway once

261
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,400
again. So breathe
through your nose.

262
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,440
And what's happening
with the air is it's

263
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,800
going to go through the
nasal cavity, and then

264
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,880
enter the nasopharynx,
the first part of

265
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,900
the pharynx, and then
go to the oropharynx

266
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:08,440
and laryngopharynx.
And then it's going to

267
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,100
air is going to mostly
go into the trachea,

268
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,060
right through the larynx
and into the lungs.

269
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,380
And the reverse path of

270
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,540
that is when
you exhale air.

271
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:22,300
On the other hand,
when you have food, you

272
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,580
will go through hopefully
the oral cavity.

273
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,880
I hope you don't
ingest food through

274
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,340
the nasal cavity. So
go through the oral

275
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:34,560
cavity and when it
passes the uvula, you've

276
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,400
entered the oral
pharynx and then

277
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,320
laryngopharynx. And of
course, you don't want

278
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,900
food going into your
larynx and trachea.

279
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,740
So it's going to
bypass past that and go

280
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,660
into the esophagus
and into the stomach.

281
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:52,930
So now we're going
to talk about

282
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:54,550
the mechanics
of ingestion,

283
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,350
which is a very
elegant system.

284
00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:01,550
So first, what
happens is when you're

285
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:04,270
processing the food,
you've ingested

286
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:05,950
it and it's in
the oral cavity.

287
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:09,610
The first phase of
ingestion is called

288
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:12,350
the oral phase. And
this is where the

289
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:14,930
depression or sorry,
the elevation of the

290
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:19,830
tongue is going to
push the bolus of the

291
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:22,850
food posteriorly
towards the pharynx.

292
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:27,970
And then the next
section or phase two

293
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:30,870
is called the pharyngeal
phase. And this

294
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,920
is where the soft
palate and the uvula

295
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,050
elevates to close up
the pathway between

296
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:40,070
the oropharynx and
the nasopharynx.

297
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:42,390
And so what this
does is it prevents

298
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:46,210
the food from entering
the nasal cavity.

299
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:50,190
And the third stage is
called the esophageal

300
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,830
phase. And this
is where the food

301
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:55,290
that's already in
the oropharynx gets

302
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:57,810
pushed down through
sequential contraction

303
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:59,910
of pharyngeal
constrictor muscles, and

304
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:02,010
then keeps on going
through palestalsis

305
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:04,670
through the esophagus
into the stomach.

306
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:08,290
And so the important
step here, well, all

307
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:09,990
three are important,
but something to know

308
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:12,570
about the second phase
or the pharyngeal

309
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:16,460
phase is that the soft
palate and the uvula

310
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,400
closes that pathway
into the nasal

311
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:22,370
cavity. So what I want
you to do is, oh, and

312
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:23,990
the other thing that
happens, excuse me,

313
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:27,890
is that the epiglottis
is going to come down

314
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:30,870
to block that pathway
between the oral,

315
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:34,330
sorry, the laryngopharynx
into the larynx.

316
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:36,170
So the food doesn't get
through there. So the

317
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:38,510
important consequence
of these things

318
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:42,950
happening in phase two
is that you can't breathe

319
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:45,270
and swallow at the same
time. So what I want

320
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:49,230
you to do now is try
to swallow either the

321
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:51,430
food that you might
have in front of you or

322
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:55,950
your spit works as
well, and try to breathe

323
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:58,090
at the same time. And
hopefully you find that

324
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,520
you can't do those
things simultaneously.

325
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:08,190
But an infant has a
superpower because

326
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:10,730
what they have
to do is suckle

327
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:13,330
and drink a lot
of milk and this

328
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:15,930
could take tens of
seconds to minutes

329
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:19,110
and during that
time obviously the

330
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:21,170
baby needs to breathe.
So how do babies

331
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:23,670
do that? Well what
happens in babies

332
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:26,450
is that the larynx
and the epiglottis

333
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:30,750
sit more superiorly
than in adults.

334
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:35,010
And what happens when
a baby's suckling is

335
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:39,390
that these two
structures, or excuse me,

336
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:41,350
the epiglottis and
the soft palate or the

337
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:44,910
uvula as well, interlock
in the middle of

338
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:49,590
the oral cavity. And
what this allows is

339
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:55,450
that it prevents the
milk from going into

340
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:58,750
the nasal cavity, but
rather the fluid or

341
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:03,930
the milk is going to
pass laterally and

342
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:10,670
bypass the pathway
into the larynx and the

343
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:14,130
trachea. So it goes
around that hole and

344
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:18,450
then flows posteriorly
into the esophagus.

345
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:21,170
So it's an elegant
kind of solution

346
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:23,490
to allowing
babies to breathe

347
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:25,550
and suckle at
the same time.

348
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:30,750
Okay, and let's also talk

349
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,490
about paranasal sinuses.

350
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:36,230
And so there are four
sets of paranasal

351
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:38,410
sinuses. They're paired,
which means they're

352
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:41,690
on both sides of
the head. And all

353
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:45,290
these paranasal sinuses
are named after the

354
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:47,130
bones that they sit
in. So for example,

355
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:49,290
the frontal sinus,
which is located sort

356
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:51,490
of in the middle,
just above your eyes,

357
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:55,990
that sits inside of
the frontal bone,

358
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:58,390
and ethmoid sinus
sits in the ethmoid

359
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:00,270
bone, sphenoid
sinus, that sits more

360
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:02,710
posteriorly, sits
inside of the sphenoid

361
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:05,350
bone, and maxidur
sinus, which is

362
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,350
going to be inside
the maxilla bone.

363
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:10,830
and all these sinuses
are connected to

364
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:14,110
the nasal cavity via
an opening the fram

365
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:17,130
not called osteo
and so the there are

366
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:19,590
multiple roles for
peranasal sinuses so

367
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:22,090
first not so much
the case in humans or

368
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:24,250
that it doesn't really
matter but they it

369
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,990
lightens the skull
weight a little bit

370
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:29,890
and it also allows for
the inhaled air to be

371
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:33,290
more humidified and
heated and then also

372
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:35,730
increases the resonance
for hearing. And this

373
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:40,410
is a reason why your
voice sounds differently

374
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,830
when you're talking
and hearing versus

375
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,950
when you're hearing a
recording of yourself.

376
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:49,410
And the clinical
relevance of paranasal

377
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:51,930
sinuses, and you
would have experienced

378
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,590
this if you'd gotten
a common cold, for

379
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:56,590
example, is that these
small openings that

380
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:59,290
connect these paranasal
sinuses to the

381
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:02,650
nasal cavity often
gets clogged up, either

382
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:06,350
through inflammation
or swelling of the

383
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:10,310
nasal lining and from
a virus. So what this

384
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:14,010
does is it prevents
the sinuses to be

385
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:18,830
drained. So the sinuses
increase in pressure,

386
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:21,590
and that tends to
lead to discomfort

387
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:23,810
or facial pain. And
that's what you're

388
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:28,550
feeling often when
you get a common cold.

389
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:34,870
Now, let's talk
about the vascular

390
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:36,750
system, and we'll start
with the arteries.

391
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:40,450
So, in the neck,
we start off with a

392
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:42,410
common carotid,
which comes from the

393
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:43,910
brachiocephalic trunk
on the right side of

394
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:46,810
the body and the
aortic arch on the left

395
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,920
side of the body,
and that splits,

396
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,110
while it's passing
through the neck, into

397
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:53,670
external carotid and
internal carotid.

398
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:56,250
And as their name
implies, the external

399
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,310
carotid supplies
predominantly

400
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:00,570
structures that are
outside of the skull.

401
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:02,930
And internal carotid,
on the other hand,

402
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:06,430
supplies structures
inside of the skull.

403
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:08,730
And so that
includes the brain.

404
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:11,490
And a couple important
structures to

405
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:14,550
take note. And this
happens where the common

406
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:17,190
carotid artery splits
into the external

407
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:19,710
internal carotid
arteries. And so

408
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:21,390
one of those structures
is called the

409
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:25,310
carotid sinus. And
that's a slightly dilated

410
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:27,790
portion that's
close to this split.

411
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:32,320
And there are nerves
coming from the

412
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,470
glossopharyngeal
nerve or cranial nerve

413
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:39,070
nine around this
carotid sinus, and

414
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:41,990
that is sensitive
to the stretching.

415
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:46,810
And this allows the
carotid sinus to be

416
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:48,210
a structure that's
responsible for

417
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:50,290
monitoring blood
pressure. So when it's

418
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,510
stimulated, meaning that
when it's stretched,

419
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:54,830
that means that the
blood pressure is

420
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:58,370
high. So what it does
is it leads to slowing

421
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:00,030
of the heart rate
once the stretching

422
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:03,310
is detected, leading
to vasodilation and

423
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:05,710
eventually decrease
in blood pressure.

424
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:09,590
Another important sensory
system that exists

425
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:12,210
in this part of the
body is the carotid

426
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:19,590
body, which is a cluster
of cells, specialized

427
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:22,770
cells that are
sensitive to the level

428
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:25,330
of oxygen and carbon
dioxide in the blood.

429
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:28,510
And this is
also innervated

430
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,290
by the
glossopharyngeal nerve.

431
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:38,210
So in the last parts
of this part of the

432
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:41,350
lecture on the head
and neck anatomy or the

433
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:43,870
architecture, we're
going to cover three

434
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:46,910
important danger zones
of the head and neck.

435
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:49,470
And so the first one
is called a terion,

436
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:53,090
a junction of the frontal
bone, the parietal

437
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:55,230
bone, the temporal
bone, and the bone

438
00:21:55,230 --> 00:22:02,270
and this region is
particularly thin so in

439
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:04,690
terms of skull thickness
and what's more

440
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,710
important is that there's
an important artery

441
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:08,710
called the middle
veninial artery which

442
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:11,010
unfortunately isn't
figured in this

443
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:14,270
illustration but it sits
right underneath the

444
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:16,530
skull or the internal
surface of the skull.

445
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:22,370
So if you are hit with,
for example, a blunt

446
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:26,610
instrument to the side,
that might fracture

447
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:30,150
these thin bones, and
it could lead to the

448
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:32,650
rupturing of this
middle meningeal artery,

449
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:36,010
and you can have
hemorrhaging inside

450
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:38,670
the skull. And so
this will lead to

451
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:40,270
compression of the
brain tissue. And

452
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:42,050
obviously this can
be life threatening.

453
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:47,250
So this is a good way
or a good point to

454
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:49,410
cover different types
of what's called

455
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:52,610
intracranial hemorrhage
or hematoma. So this

456
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:57,850
is obviously a very
serious situation

457
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:01,130
where you have blood
accumulation, internal

458
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,370
bleeding in the
endocranial or the brain

459
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:08,190
cavity. And so this
leads to obviously loss

460
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:10,190
of blood supply in
some parts of the

461
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:12,290
intracranial structures
like the brain, but

462
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:14,970
also it introduces
compression for the

463
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:18,090
brain, which is also
very life-threatening.

464
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:21,690
So the three different
types of intracranial

465
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:23,790
hematomas that I'd
like you to know

466
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:27,290
include epidural
hematoma, which occurs

467
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:29,150
between the skull
and the dura mater.

468
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:31,530
The second type
is subdural

469
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:34,670
hematoma. So
this is where the

470
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:38,390
bleeding or internal
bleeding happens

471
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:40,630
between the dura mater
and the arachnoid.

472
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:43,310
And this happens
when there's

473
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:45,030
a rupture in the
bridging veins

474
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:47,570
as well as the
sagittal sinus

475
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:51,870
right here between
the two hemispheres of

476
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:54,530
the brain. And you
also have subarachnoid

477
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:57,190
hemorrhage between the
arachnoid mater and the

478
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:59,650
pia mater. And so this
is very common when

479
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:01,530
you have a cerebral
arteries rupture and

480
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:06,170
this is obviously more
internal right here.

481
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:12,070
Now let's move
on to veins.

482
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:15,030
And just like arteries
and the carotid arteries,

483
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:16,790
you have external
jugular and internal

484
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:19,890
jugular and they work
mostly in similar ways

485
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:22,490
where external jugular
is gonna drain the

486
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:27,030
blood from the temporal
and occipital regions

487
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:30,050
outside of the skull
and internal jugular

488
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:32,950
vein drains the face,
but also structures that

489
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:35,130
are inside the skull,
including the brain.

490
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:40,610
And there's a very
special structure

491
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:45,550
called the cavernous
sinus inside of the

492
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:48,570
brain cavity. And so
this sits right next

493
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:51,250
to the pituitary
fossa or the pituitary

494
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:56,930
gland and this is a
structure where the

495
00:24:57,070 --> 00:25:04,350
venous sinus covers
or is outside of an

496
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:09,270
artery and very important
nerves. In other

497
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:11,990
words, We have the
internal carotid

498
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:17,030
artery, a branch of it
here, and you have a

499
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:20,530
set of five cranial
nerves or four if

500
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:22,490
you just count cranial
nerve five as one

501
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:24,850
of them. But these
are the two divisions.

502
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:26,790
You have cranial
nerves that are

503
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:30,250
bathing in deoxygenated
blood, which is

504
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:34,050
a very unique
configuration that's

505
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:36,550
only happening in
the cavernous sinus.

506
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:39,250
So you have, well,
what's inside

507
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:40,750
the cavernous
sinus? Let's go over

508
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,790
one by one. So
you have a branch

509
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:44,250
of the internal
carotid artery.

510
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:46,450
You also have
cranial nerve

511
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:48,330
three or ocular
motor nerve,

512
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:50,050
trochlear nerve,

513
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:52,330
deucin's nerve, and
these three cranial

514
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:53,990
nerves, which we will
cover a little bit

515
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:56,790
later, are responsible
for eye movement.

516
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:59,470
And then you also
have two divisions of

517
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:02,450
the fifth cranial
nerve, the trigeminal

518
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:04,730
nerve. So that includes
ophthalmic division

519
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,770
and the maxillary
divisions of cranial

520
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:10,410
nerve five that are
also to the side.

521
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:14,570
So there are important
nerves and arterial

522
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:16,450
structures that sit
within the cavernous

523
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:18,950
sinus. Well, what's the
clinical significance

524
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:22,990
of that? Well, we
have facial vein,

525
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:27,990
which drains blood
from the face of an

526
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:31,650
individual, and these
veins are valveless.

527
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:36,310
So depending on the
internal pressure within

528
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:38,930
these venous structures,
blood may actually

529
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:42,670
flow backwards through
the superior and

530
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:45,550
inferior ophthalmic
veins. So these are the

531
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:48,790
veins that are located
on the superior part

532
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:51,430
and inferior part of
the orbit or the eye

533
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:55,190
socket. And if there's
backflow of blood, these

534
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:57,370
would directly lead
into the cavernous

535
00:26:57,370 --> 00:27:00,290
sinus, which we just
talked about. So this means

536
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:02,790
that infections
around the nose, for

537
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:05,390
example, if you have
pimples or boils around the

538
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,790
nose, this can easily
spread into the

539
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:10,490
cavernous sinus. And we
just talked about the

540
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:12,890
important structures
that are located there,

541
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:18,070
including the pterotary
and the branch of

542
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:21,270
the internal carotid
and the cranial nerves.

543
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:25,810
so this triangle
area around the

544
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,750
nose is our
second danger zone

545
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:34,190
and now we're going to
finish off by talking

546
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:36,730
about the third and
the last danger zone

547
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:39,110
but before we do i
need to introduce the

548
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:41,990
structures that are
relevant so we're

549
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:44,210
going to go back to
talking about the neck

550
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:48,030
and in the neck we
have a series of fascia

551
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:52,570
and so we have investing
fascia which goes

552
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:56,950
around almost the
perimeter of the neck.

553
00:27:57,030 --> 00:28:00,050
And these fascia
collectively form

554
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:01,190
different
compartments, just

555
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:03,090
like in the upper
and lower limbs.

556
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:06,450
And so again, we went
over the investing

557
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:08,270
fascia, which are
the most superficial.

558
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:11,090
And then we have the
pre-tracheal fascia,

559
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:14,570
which surrounds the
thyroid gland here,

560
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:18,770
the trachea and the
esophagus. So it forms

561
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:20,850
a compartment that
includes these structures.

562
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:24,340
We also have the
carotid sheath, which

563
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:28,090
surrounds the internal
carotid and the

564
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:31,550
common carotid and the
external carotid. And

565
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:33,290
then you also have
the internal jugular.

566
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:36,950
And they're on the
both sides of the neck.

567
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:39,870
And you also have
the prevertebral

568
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:41,790
fascia, which
surrounds the

569
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:44,690
vertebrae and the
surrounding muscles.

570
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,190
And finally, we
have what's called

571
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:49,870
the alar fascia,
which connects the

572
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:53,230
two carotid sheets
on both sides.

573
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:57,950
So the third and the
last danger zone is

574
00:28:57,950 --> 00:29:01,150
this potential space
between the alar fascia

575
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:05,670
and the prevertebral
fascia. And the reason

576
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:08,230
why it's a danger
zone is because if

577
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:11,790
infection occurs in
this space, then there's

578
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:16,750
an easy route from near
the head region all

579
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:20,600
the way down through
the neck, through the

580
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:25,570
thorax and the
mediastinum, and down all

581
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:28,670
the way down to the
diaphragm. So it's an

582
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:31,510
easy sort of highway for
infections to spread.

583
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:35,550
And so this is danger
space for zone number

584
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:38,310
three. And this is
the space between the

585
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:40,750
alar fascia and the
prevertebral fascia.

586
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,610
All right. So now that
we covered the lay

587
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:47,790
of the land in the
head and the neck,

588
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:50,350
here's an example question
that will showcase

589
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:54,090
what an exam question
would look like.

590
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:57,550
So a 30-year-old
patient is admitted to a

591
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:59,430
hospital with a
traumatic injury to the

592
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:02,710
head. CT scan reveals
that the left middle

593
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:04,810
meningeal artery
between the skull and

594
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:08,030
the dura mater has
ruptured. So which type

595
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:10,150
of intracranial
hematoma or hemorrhage

596
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:13,310
describes this injury?
So we have a cross

597
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:17,030
-section from a CT
scan, and then we have

598
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:20,110
this illustration from
one of the previous

599
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,570
slides that show the
different types of

600
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:26,090
intracranial hemorrhage
slash hematoma.

601
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:30,130
so i will give
you about 15

602
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:33,030
seconds to think
of the answer okay

603
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:54,560
so the important
information here is that

604
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:57,540
the middle meningeal
artery sits between

605
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:59,980
the skull and the
dura model and we

606
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:02,300
learned this is relevant
to the first danger

607
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:05,020
zone the terion which
is to the side of

608
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:07,520
the skull this is
this particularly thin

609
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:11,950
part of the skull and
so because the rupture

610
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:15,380
happened on the artery
that sits between

611
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:17,980
the skull and the
dura mater it's going

612
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:21,560
to be in that epidural
space over here

613
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:27,320
so the answer is e
epidural hematoma

1
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:05,070
This is part two
of the FOM lecture

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:07,190
on special senses
and organs.

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:09,170
And so these are
senses and organs that

4
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:11,470
exist only in the
head and the neck.

5
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:15,390
We're going to
quickly cover the five

6
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,810
special senses in
the head and neck. So

7
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:19,630
these are senses that
should be familiar to

8
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,130
you. You use them
every day. And these

9
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,450
include the sense of
olfaction or smell,

10
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:25,610
vision,

11
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,710
taste or gustation,

12
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:29,850
hearing, and balance.

13
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,190
And we will not
cover these in a

14
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:34,470
big detail today.
you will have

15
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,970
another lecture that
will cover these

16
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,790
senses in much
greater detail.

17
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:42,110
We'll start off with
salivary glands. So

18
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:44,590
salivary glands
secrete saliva directly

19
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:47,290
into the oral cavity
through ducts. And so

20
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:49,570
you think there's only
one set of salivary

21
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:51,870
glands, but there are
actually three. So

22
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,750
we'll start with
parotid gland, which is

23
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,890
located anterior
to the ears in the

24
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,990
posterior cheek region,
which you can see here.

25
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:02,030
And it secretes a
lot of watery saliva

26
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:05,710
given the parasympathetic
innervation.

27
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:07,170
And then when you have a

28
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,930
sympathetic
innervation firing up,

29
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:11,150
then you have a
small amount of

30
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:12,910
viscous saliva
that gets produced.

31
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:16,730
Next up is submandibular
gland, which

32
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:19,550
is located just
below the inferior

33
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:21,510
margin of the
mandible. And the

34
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,910
secretions travel through
this submandibular

35
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:26,350
duct to get into
the oral cavity.

36
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,090
And finally you
have the sublingual

37
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:31,130
gland which is located
in the floor of

38
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:33,450
the mouth and the
secretions travel

39
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,630
superiorly through
just numerous small

40
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:37,790
ducts instead of
one central duct.

41
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,350
You also have a lacrimal

42
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:44,330
apparatus in the head

43
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:48,570
which is a system
responsible for crying. So

44
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,610
crying starts with
the lacrimal gland

45
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,110
producing tears and going
through the lacrimal

46
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:58,830
ducts, which will place
the tears onto the

47
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:02,010
surface of the eyes,
which then, as you blink,

48
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,170
gets washed
away immediately

49
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,790
into the canaliculi.

50
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:10,390
And those drain into
the lacrimal *** right

51
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:14,410
next to the nasal
cavity, and then drains

52
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:17,490
down through the nasal
lacrimal duct, and then

53
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:19,930
there's an opening
into the nasal cavity.

54
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:23,470
And this is why
when you cry, you

55
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,330
tend to sniffle
because you have the

56
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:28,030
tears going into
the nasal cavity.

57
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,370
And of course,
when this drainage

58
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:32,350
system gets blocked
by injury or

59
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:34,310
infection, then it
can lead to irritated

60
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,750
eyes since you
have accumulation

61
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,830
of tears on the
surface of the eye.

62
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,170
In addition to the
glands in the head, you

63
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:44,090
also have important
glands in the neck.

64
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:46,470
So these include the
thyroid, which is an

65
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:49,910
H-shaped gland that sits
in front or anterior

66
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:52,110
to the trachea. And
the function of the

67
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,150
thyroid is that it
takes up iodine from

68
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:57,090
food to produce growth
hormones. So these

69
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:00,490
include the T3 and T4
hormones. So they're

70
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:04,390
triiodothyronine and
thyroxine hormones.

71
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,310
And the production
is controlled

72
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,270
by the pituitary gland.

73
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:11,210
You also have the
parathyroid glands. You

74
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:14,070
have superior to
inferior sets, and

75
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:16,190
these sit within the
thyroid gland and

76
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:19,850
produces parathyroid
hormone, and it helps to

77
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:22,490
regulate calcium and
phosphorus levels

78
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:25,730
in the body and also
controlled by pteriotary

79
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,870
gland as well as
the hypothalamus.

80
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,530
Lastly, we have the
thymus gland, which

81
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:36,290
is active in
newborns and up until

82
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:38,870
adolescence. It
produces thymusin that

83
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:41,510
produces or promotes
differentiation and

84
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:44,690
maturation in T
lymphocyte precursors that

85
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:47,030
get transported from
the bone marrow.

86
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:51,310
And so you'll notice
in the cadavers in the

87
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,750
anatomy lab that
the thymus will look

88
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,910
probably like a blob of
adipose tissue because

89
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:59,650
they're not active in
mature individuals.

90
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,630
now the clinical
correlate related to these

91
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:08,630
glands specifically
the thyroid gland is

92
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:11,010
goiter so this happens
when there's an

93
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:13,430
*********** of the
thyroid gland and it's

94
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:15,970
presented externally as
a lump on the anterior

95
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:18,790
mid middle aspect
of the neck and this

96
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:21,670
is often due to iodine
deficiency so in

97
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,950
renaissance paintings
you can actually see

98
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:27,210
evidence of goiter in
some of the portraits

99
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:32,330
so this could be due
to hyperthyroidism so

100
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:35,110
obviously when you
have a larger thyroid

101
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:37,090
gland it could lead
to overproduction of

102
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:40,610
thyroid hormones but
this *********** of the

103
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,730
thyroid gland can
also be caused by

104
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:45,130
hypothyroidism because
the underproduction of

105
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:48,250
thyroid hormones will
lead to the swelling of

106
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,410
glands in order to
try to produce more

107
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:54,870
growth hormones and goiter
could cause breathing

108
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,630
and swallowing
difficulties or even

109
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,730
speech loss due to
the compression of the

110
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:02,380
trachea, larynx,
esophagus, and the current

111
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,030
laryngeal nerve, which
allows us to speak.

1
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:04,360
This is part three
of the FOM lecture on

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,500
the introduction of
the head and neck. And

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,180
in this part, we're
gonna be covering all

4
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,280
12 cranial nerves.
And this will serve

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,500
as an introductory
summary and overview of

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,170
these cranial nerves,
which are vitally

7
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:18,160
important for the
function of not only the

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,840
head and neck, but
the rest of the body.

9
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,740
So the cranial nerves,
as I mentioned, there

10
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,540
are 12 of them and
they are numbered based

11
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:31,140
on the sequence in which
they leave the brain

12
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,180
cavity. So all of them
emerge from the brain

13
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,000
and they exit the brain
cavity in order to

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,100
innervate structures
outside of the skull.

15
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,660
So it starts
anteriorly from

16
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,820
olfactory nerve or
cranial nerve 1.

17
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,540
And then the larger
numbers, cranial nerve

18
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,860
11 and 12, for example,
the accessory and

19
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,300
hypoglossal nerves
emerge from the brain

20
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,600
and exit the brain
cavity more posteriorly.

21
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,140
so it is your
responsibility to know

22
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,400
how these cranial
nerves exit the brain

23
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,540
cavity and into the
structures within

24
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,660
and outside the
skull but we won't go

25
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:13,320
over this in detail
right now because

26
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,620
of interest of time
but make sure to

27
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:18,520
know their cranial
exits for the exams

28
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,560
a useful resource for
learning the functions

29
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,860
of different cranial
nerves is in the more

30
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,140
clinically oriented
anatomy ninth edition

31
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,940
which you have access
to to the electronic

32
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:34,460
copy through the NYIT
library and specifically

33
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,880
figure 10.4 which
is shown here shows

34
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,560
a nice diagram where
it highlights all the

35
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,860
different functionalities
of the cranial

36
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:44,700
nerves and as i mentioned
in the beginning

37
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,940
of this part of the
video or the lecture.

38
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,700
This is just an
introductory overview of

39
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,500
these 12 cranial nerves.
So I will be going

40
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,960
over just one or a couple
of the functions of

41
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,060
each of these nerves,
but make sure by the

42
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,200
end of the block,
you will need to know

43
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,620
all the functions of
all 12 cranial nerves.

44
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,840
So towards this goal,
I highly recommend

45
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,600
you to pause this video
to create this table

46
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,180
right here. And
what this table will

47
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,680
show is summarize basically
all the information

48
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,160
I will be giving
you, not only in this

49
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,430
part of the lecture,
but by other lectures

50
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:29,300
given by the anatomy
faculty members.

51
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,400
So in the first
column, you'll have the

52
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,360
cranial nerves numbered
as well as their names.

53
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,420
In the second column,
you can have the

54
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,380
cranial exits. So
these are the foramina

55
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,940
or the openings
that the cranial

56
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,200
nerves will use to
exit the brain cavity.

57
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,000
And then we also have
the fiber types. Are

58
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,890
they sensory, motor,
visceral, or skeletal?

59
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,500
And then their functions.

60
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,800
So what do they do?

61
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,720
So what we're going to
do now is we're going

62
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,840
to go through this
cranial nerve marathon.

63
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,880
And I'm going to make
it interactive so

64
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,440
you understand some
of the functions.

65
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,920
so the best way to
start is with cranial

66
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,220
nerve 1 which is also
called olfactory nerve

67
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,680
and tract and
the reason why we

68
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,780
differentiate between
olfactory nerve and tract

69
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:16,560
is the stock that you
see here coming out

70
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,060
of the brain is
referred to as olfactory

71
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,260
tract because technically
it's not a nerve

72
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,080
it's actually a
pinched portion of the

73
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,380
brain that extends
towards the nasal cavity

74
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:32,040
but the olfactory nerve
refers to the nerves

75
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,100
that connect the
olfactory bulb to the

76
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:39,100
sensors in the olfactory
epithelium which is

77
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,780
where you're actually
going to be smelling

78
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:44,440
the compounds so
olfactory nerve as the

79
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,060
name implies has only
one function and this

80
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,740
is olfaction or the sense
of smell and because

81
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:53,260
sense of smell is one
of the five special

82
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,000
senses that only
exist in the head and

83
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,380
neck, its fiber type
is special sensory. So

84
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:03,120
if you have a coffee,
a tea, or any kind of

85
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,480
food in front of you,
you can go ahead and

86
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,040
smell it. And you can
thank this cranial

87
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,880
nerve or the olfactory
nerve for allowing

88
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,020
you to smell wonderful
things in the world.

89
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,020
Now let's go over
to the optic nerve.

90
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:23,360
And similar to the
olfactory nerve, this

91
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,520
has only one special
function, which is

92
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,520
vision. And because
vision is one of those

93
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,840
five special senses,
the fiber types

94
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,320
is also going to be
special sensory. So

95
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,060
if you're looking at
these slides right

96
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,560
now, then you can
thank the optic nerve.

97
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:46,910
Moving forward, we
have the oculomotor

98
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:48,650
nerve, which is
cranial nerve three.

99
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:50,750
So if you see the
laser pointer right

100
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,050
now on the slide,
you can follow it

101
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:57,230
around the slides
while you keep your

102
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:00,610
head still. So just
move your eyes.

103
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,370
And if you're following
the laser pointer,

104
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,640
then it means that
you're using this

105
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:09,410
oculomotor nerve. So
oculomotor nerve is

106
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:12,310
responsible for providing
motor innervation to

107
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:16,230
extraocular muscles,
which surround the eyes.

108
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,810
And these include
the superior ******,

109
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:21,070
inferior ******, and
medial ****** muscles,

110
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,790
as well as inferior
oblique and levator

111
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,430
palpebrae superioris.
And this last muscle

112
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:29,910
is responsible for
elevating your eyelids.

113
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:34,490
And you'll notice that
I have a grayed out

114
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:37,790
text down here. So in
subsequent slides, if

115
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,530
you see these gray
texts, it means that

116
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:42,530
these are other functions
and the fiber types

117
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:44,770
that are included
in these cranial

118
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:47,070
nerves. But for now,
don't really focus

119
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:49,370
on them. For this
week, just focus on

120
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:51,730
learning at least
one or two of the

121
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:53,770
functions of each of
the cranial nerves.

122
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:56,430
Next up is the trochlear

123
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:58,350
nerve, cranial
nerve four.

124
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:02,630
And just like the
last slide with the

125
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:05,450
oculomotor nerve,
while keeping your

126
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:08,850
head still, follow
the laser pointer.

127
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,690
So look down and
then to the side.

128
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:17,270
And this is the
function of the superior

129
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:20,010
oblique muscle. So this
is another nerve that's

130
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:21,970
responsible for eye
movement or at least

131
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:24,550
one component of it.
And so it provides

132
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:28,890
somatic motor innervation
to the superior oblique

133
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:31,250
muscle. And the word
trochlear comes from

134
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,410
Greek word trochlea,
which means pulley.

135
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:37,330
So when you're dissecting
in the orbit region

136
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:40,330
in the anatomy lab,
you're able to see

137
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:43,590
the superior oblique
actually go through

138
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,850
this pulley system. And
that's why they have

139
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:51,410
a slightly strange
action on the eyeball.

140
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,310
Now, what I want
you to do is make

141
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,850
this face that
Albert Einstein

142
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,670
is making in this
famous photo.

143
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:02,590
And keep in mind what
you can see in this

144
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:05,130
photo, which part of
the face and the tongue.

145
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:12,370
And the sensory innervation
for what you saw

146
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:13,990
on Albert Einstein's
face, and hopefully

147
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:16,850
your face if you were
making one, is the

148
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:20,710
trigeminal nerve. So it
provides somatic sensory

149
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:23,470
innervation to most
of the head, as well

150
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,710
as the teeth. And it's
divided into three

151
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:28,210
major branches or
divisions, which you will

152
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:30,970
learn in both lab and
subsequent lectures.

153
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,370
So this means that if
someone touches your

154
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:39,070
face, hopefully you
don't get punched in

155
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,690
the face. But what
you're feeling, the

156
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:43,390
sensation, is thanks to
the trigeminal nerve.

157
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:48,490
cranial nerve six uh
so we're almost halfway

158
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:52,230
there is called abducens
nerve uh so just

159
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:55,090
like the trochlear
nerve it provides motor

160
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:57,150
innovation or somatic
motor innovation

161
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:00,330
to one of the extraocular
muscles that move

162
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:02,570
the eye and this is the
lateral ****** muscle

163
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:06,130
which abduxt the
eye so hold up your

164
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:09,790
skull or head still
and follow the laser

165
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:13,350
pointer and when you're
moving your eyes side

166
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:16,770
to side, you can thank
the abducens nerve.

167
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,270
Now we're on to
the facial nerve or

168
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:22,530
cranial nerve
seven. And so what I

169
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:25,590
would like you to
do is make a smile.

170
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:32,090
And facial nerve is
the cranial nerve

171
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:33,950
that allows you to make
facial expressions.

172
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:36,270
So they provide somatic
motor innervation

173
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:38,470
to muscles of facial
expression. And

174
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:40,790
there's a lot in
humans because facial

175
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:43,330
expression is such
an important part of

176
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:45,770
our daily lives,
including healthcare.

177
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,090
And you'll see that
it has a lot of

178
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:49,890
other functions,
which again, you

179
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:52,070
don't need to worry
about today, but

180
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,770
you will need to
know for the exams.

181
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:01,580
Cranial nerve eight is
called vestibulocochlear.

182
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:04,050
So what I'd like
you to do is,

183
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:06,710
well, if you're hearing
this lecture, it means

184
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:08,890
that you're using
the sense of hearing.

185
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:11,430
And if you want to
stand up and do some

186
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:15,390
jumping jacks and sway
your body left and

187
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:18,010
right, you should be
able to sense, you

188
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:19,810
know, where you are in
the space. And that's

189
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,950
because of the sense
of balance that you

190
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:24,390
have. And both hearing
and balance are

191
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:27,190
provided by this
vestibulocochlear nerve.

192
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:29,870
And both of these
senses are, of course,

193
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,830
two of the five
special senses of the

194
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:34,530
head and neck. So the
cranial nerve eight

195
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:36,310
or vestibulocochlear
nerve provides

196
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,930
special sensory nerves
or innervations.

197
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,190
Next up is
glossopharyngeal nerve or

198
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:47,210
cranial nerve 9. And
if you have food or

199
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:49,910
drink in front of
you, ingest them and

200
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:53,570
any taste that you
can sense towards the

201
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:56,290
back of the tongue
is thanks to the

202
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:57,890
glossopharyngeal
nerve. So they provide

203
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:00,250
special sensory or
the sense of taste

204
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,950
for a posterior one
third of the tongue.

205
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:05,770
Another function that
I'd like you to know

206
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:07,550
at this point for
glossopharyngeal nerve

207
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,410
is that they provide
visceral sensory

208
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:11,650
innervation to the
carotid sinus and body,

209
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:13,490
which talked about
earlier in this lecture.

210
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:19,450
Now we're on to the
vagus nerve or the

211
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:22,180
cranial nerve 10. This
is a big nerve and

212
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:26,530
it provides visceral
motor innervation.

213
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:28,290
So it's part of the
parasympathetic pathway

214
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:30,730
for all the smooth
muscles and glands in

215
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:33,030
the thoracic abdominal
visceral organs.

216
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:37,690
So vagus means wander
in Latin. So it

217
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:39,650
lives up to its
name. So its nerves

218
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:42,310
extends all the way
from the head, neck

219
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:44,950
into the thoracic
abdominal regions.

220
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:48,930
So one of the other
functions is actually

221
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,370
what you're hearing.
The ability for

222
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:54,850
me to speak is thanks
due to the vagus

223
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:57,510
nervous, specifically
the recurrent

224
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:59,690
laryngeal nerves,
which is a branch off

225
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:01,770
of the vagus, which
you would have seen

226
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:05,170
in block one anatomy
labs. So remember

227
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:07,670
that function as
well for this week.

228
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,690
Okay. So the penultimate
cranial nerve is

229
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:14,770
called spinal accessory
nerve or cranial

230
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:17,170
nerve 11. So this is
partly going to be

231
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:18,870
reviewed because this
is one of the first

232
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:22,230
nerves that you
studied in the anatomy

233
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:25,190
lab. So So you know
from before that

234
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:27,510
spinal accessory nerve
provides somatic motor

235
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:29,970
innervation through
the trapezius

236
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:33,170
muscle, but it
also innervates the

237
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:36,110
sternocleidomastory muscle,
the side of the neck.

238
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:39,070
So what that allows
you to do is to

239
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:42,110
rotate your head to
the left and the right.

240
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:44,090
So do that right
now. And that's all

241
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:46,050
thanks to the spinal
accessory nerve.

242
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,170
Now we're at the end.
So this is cranial

243
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:52,790
nerve 12 or the
hypoglossal nerve.

244
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:55,690
And this nerve
allows for tongue

245
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,690
movement. So let's
stick our tongues out.

246
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:00,270
And being able
to do that is

247
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:02,490
due to this
hypoglossal nerve.

248
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:10,670
So we've gone through
all 12 cranial nerves,

249
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,750
and it can be overwhelming.
But the earlier

250
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,010
you start studying
these cranial nerves,

251
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:17,150
the easier time you
will have with the rest

252
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:19,210
of the block on head
and neck in anatomy.

253
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:22,450
And because these 12
cranial nerves help to

254
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:26,230
unify the functions
of the head and neck.

255
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:29,350
So what's a great way
to organize all the

256
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:31,230
12 cranial nerves?
So this is one of the

257
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:33,010
ways which might be
helpful when you're

258
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:36,170
studying. So first, the
one grouping you can

259
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:39,690
have is to have cranial
nerves that only

260
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:43,150
provide special sensory
fibers and nothing

261
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:45,430
else. So these include
cranial nerve 1,

262
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:48,290
cranial nerve 2, and
cranial nerve 8. So

263
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:50,550
olfactory, optic, and
vestibulocochlear.

264
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:52,970
And these nerves
are associated with

265
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,930
special senses in
the head and neck.

266
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,290
the other way or the
other group that you

267
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:01,710
can create is cranial
nerves that provide

268
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:05,490
only somatic motor
fibers so these

269
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:08,470
include the nerves
that provide movement

270
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:11,390
in the eye so ocular
motor nerve, cochlear

271
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:14,790
nerve, and abducens
and also accessory

272
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:17,710
nerves and hypoglossal
nerves that provide

273
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:21,960
motor innervation
to the trapezius

274
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:25,310
sternocleidomastoid
as well as the tongue

275
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:29,410
and then finally we
have the third category

276
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:31,630
so these are
branchiomeric nerves you

277
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:33,650
don't need to know the
name but that means

278
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:35,970
they're derived from
pharyngeal arches which

279
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:38,190
we'll cover in the head
and neck embryology

280
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:41,730
lecture for what they
are but these nerves

281
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:45,350
so cranial nerve 5
7 9 and 10 these are

282
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:47,890
going to be relatively
complex nerves because

283
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,950
they're going to
provide a lot of

284
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:52,430
different functions. So
these will probably be

285
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:55,610
the hardest ones to
study for, but get

286
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:57,810
started on starting to
learn their functions.

287
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:03,920
So here's an example
exam question. So a

288
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,730
NYIT comm student
is about to get her

289
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:07,970
wisdom teeth pulled.
Which of the following

290
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:09,610
cranial nerves should
be targeted for

291
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:12,170
local anesthesia.
So think about what

292
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:15,410
provides sensory
innervation to the teeth.

293
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:33,410
So the answer is
pigeminal nerve or

294
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:35,530
cranial nerve
five, because that

295
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:37,750
division or branch
off of that will

296
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,730
provide sensory
innervation to all the

297
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:42,650
teeth, both upper
and lower rows.

298
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:49,330
So for the lecture on
introduction to the

299
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:51,870
head and neck, these
are some of the high

300
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,450
yield topics that
you should focus on

301
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:55,670
when you're studying.
So the first one is to

302
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,550
understand the
anatomical organization

303
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:01,010
of the skeletal, nervous,
vascular, digestive,

304
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:03,750
and respiratory
systems, and how these

305
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:07,970
changes from newborns
to adult for the

306
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:09,710
ones that I've shown
you in the lectures.

307
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:13,270
Also know the three
danger zones in the

308
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:15,230
head and neck and why
they're dangerous.

309
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,910
Also know the locations
and functions of

310
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,850
the organs that only
exist in the head and

311
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:23,210
the neck, including
glands and then know

312
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:26,050
the names fiber types
and functions and

313
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,910
the cranial exits for
each of the cranial

314
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:31,110
nerves and then finally
pay attention to

315
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:32,730
the clinical correlates
that i went over

316
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:36,750
in my lecture finally
extra set of tips

317
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,710
so head and neck is
definitely difficult

318
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:41,110
uh region to study
there's a lot packed

319
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:44,450
into a fairly small
space but don't panic

320
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:48,120
start one by one and
one way you can focus

321
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:52,010
on, you know, which
topics to study is to

322
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:54,250
go through the CPG
learning objectives.

323
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,490
And what you can also
do is start learning

324
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:59,130
the cranial nerves,
which is vitally

325
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:02,410
important for this
region. So this week,

326
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:04,510
I highly recommend
just getting

327
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:07,210
comfortable with the
names and the numbers of

328
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:09,250
each of the cranial
nerves. And then

329
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,570
next week, start
learning at least one of

330
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,310
the functions of of
each cranial nerve.

331
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:15,810
And then beyond that,
just keep learning

332
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:17,590
all the functions
that will be covered

333
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:19,610
in subsequent lectures
in more detail.

334
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,950
This is the end of
the FOM lecture on the

335
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:26,010
introduction to the
head and neck. I would

336
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:28,150

337
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:30,530
