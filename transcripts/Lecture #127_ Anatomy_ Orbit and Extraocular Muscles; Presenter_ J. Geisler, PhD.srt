00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,570
Hello, class. Dr.
Jonathan Geisler here.

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:04,090
So today I'm going
to be talking to you

3
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:07,050
about the orbit and the
extraocular muscles.

4
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:08,950
And this lecture is
going to be distributed

5
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:11,050
among four videos.
So this is the first

6
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:13,410
one. So let's go
ahead and get started.

7
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:16,710
Okay. So there's going
to be quite a few

8
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,730
session or objectives
for these sessions.

9
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:22,690
But let's go ahead
and start with

10
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:23,950
the one that we're
going to be covering

11
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:26,490
in this first of four
videos. And so by

12
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:27,810
the end of the
session, you should be

13
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,790
able to infer what
structures can be

14
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:33,290
affected by blowout
fractures of the orbit.

15
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,130
In terms of sort
of contents for

16
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:39,990
this first video,
this part one,

17
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:40,710
we're going to
be talking about

18
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,850
orbit boundaries
and its contents.

19
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:46,050
So here we're looking at

20
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:49,670
an axial MRI of the head.

21
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:52,450
You can see the nose
here. Here's the

22
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:56,050
brain right there in
the cranial cavity.

23
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:59,010
These are the
ethmoidal sinuses,

24
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,790
bright white here.
These are the

25
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:03,590
eyes. And then this
here is the orbit.

26
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:06,390
You might be able
to tell that this is

27
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,890
a T2-weighted MRI
by the fact that the

28
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:12,010
cerebral spinal fluid
is bright white.

29
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:14,830
What I want to draw
your attention to here

30
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:18,270
is how bright it is in
the orbit. And that's

31
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,310
basically telling us
that the orbit has

32
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,770
a lot of adipose tissue.
This is one of those

33
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:25,090
interesting anatomical
facts that's not

34
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:27,750
really often apparent
when you look at a kind

35
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,910
of schematic image in
an anatomy textbook,

36
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:33,190
but it's important
because this adipose

37
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:36,530
tissue essentially
behaves sort of like a

38
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:40,280
fluid. So if there is
pressure on the orbit,

39
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,590
fluids are non
-compressible. So this

40
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,350
fat is non-compressible,
and if there's

41
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:47,670
enough pressure,
that adipose tissue

42
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,350
is going to want to
go somewhere else,

43
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,710
and that can potentially
cause a trauma

44
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:54,810
in the orbit and
surrounding tissues.

45
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,050
So let's talk about
the boundaries of

46
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:01,750
the orbit and one way
to sort of envision

47
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:04,330
it is like a
pyramid with an apex

48
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:06,710
here in the posterior
end of the orbit

49
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,410
and then four sides,
a superior side

50
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:12,210
also called the
roof, a medial side,

51
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,750
an inferior side or
floor, and a lateral

52
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,170
side. in terms of
the bones that make

53
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:21,490
up these different
sides, the roof is

54
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:23,770
predominantly formed
by the frontal bone.

55
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:27,170
Then the lateral
side here is formed

56
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:29,850
by this pink bone,
the sphenoid bone.

57
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,210
It's divided into
two parts. So the

58
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:34,870
greater wing of the
sphenoid makes up

59
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:37,070
most of the lateral
side of the orbit.

60
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:39,130
This part here called
the lesser wing

61
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:40,610
of the sphenoid
contributes a little

62
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,690
part here to the
roof of the orbit.

63
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,230
And this bone
here, the zygomatic

64
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:47,590
bone, helps form
that lateral side

65
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:50,440
of the orbit. The
maxilla in gray

66
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,930
forms most of the
floor of the orbit.

67
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:55,950
And then the medial
side of the orbit has

68
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:58,430
contributions from
the frontal, but is

69
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,750
predominantly formed
here by this plate of

70
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,810
the ethmoid, and also
a contribution here

71
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:06,330
from this bone here,
which is the lacrimal.

72
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,510
Now, in addition to these

73
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:10,670
bones, which are
fairly rigid,

74
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:14,350
the floor of the orbit,
right, or this orbital

75
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:18,530
pyramid here, is
sealed up by this tough

76
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:22,270
fibrous membrane called
the orbital septum.

77
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:25,310
And the reason that's
important is pretty

78
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:28,070
much all sides of the
orbit are fairly rigid.

79
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,570
So, for example, if
there was bleeding

80
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:33,210
inside the orbit, such
like maybe a patient

81
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:35,470
arrives in the ER after
being in an automobile

82
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:38,070
accident, you can
have a situation

83
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:40,990
develop in the orbit,
much like a compartment

84
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,830
syndrome in the limb.
So a lot of pressure

85
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:45,130
can build up very
quickly. So you might

86
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:47,790
choose to cut this
medial or lateral

87
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:50,850
palpebral ligament to
let some of the blood

88
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:53,110
out and relieve the
pressure in the orbit.

89
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:58,630
here we're looking
at a coronal ct of

90
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:01,990
the head this is where
the anterior cranial

91
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:04,050
cavity and the
brain is right here

92
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:07,810
got one orbit the
other here's the oral

93
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:10,450
cavity with the teeth
as you know by now

94
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,230
black essentially
indicates air so these

95
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:16,930
are the paranasal
sinuses that are on

96
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:19,210
either side of the
nasal cavities here.

97
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:21,890
And what I want to
draw your attention

98
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:24,970
to is how incredibly
thin is the bone

99
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:28,510
that is separating
the medial wall of

100
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:31,050
the orbit from the
ethmoidal sinuses

101
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:33,730
and the floor
of the orbit

102
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,530
from the
maxillary sinuses.

103
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:38,210
And so as I was talking
before, if there's

104
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,530
any pressure to the
orbit, say maybe this

105
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,250
individual falls
and there's a lot of

106
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,950
pressure on the eye.
That adipose tissue,

107
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,520
remember, is not going
to be very compressible,

108
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,410
so it's going to
want to go somewhere.

109
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:51,430
It might break
through this thin bone

110
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,540
here, and in fact,
you can see right here

111
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:56,150
some of the contents
of the orbit are

112
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,690
pushing into this
ethmoidal sinus here.

113
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:01,790
Also, they may go into
the maxillary sinus,

114
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:03,690
and so it's not just
adipose tissue that

115
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:05,810
would do this, but
potentially some of the

116
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:07,890
extraocular muscles, which
we'll be talking about

117
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,310
in a minute, could
get trapped in there.

118
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,990
You could have also
some of the nerves and

119
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:16,510
artery of the eye get
damaged or cut by these

120
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:18,410
fractures. So
whenever you have

121
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:21,410
contents of the
orbit going into one

122
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:23,550
of these adjacent
paranasal sinuses,

123
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,730
that's called a
blowout fracture.

124
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:29,650
So for the rest of
this video, I'm going

125
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:33,010
to focus on the basic
anatomy, these extraocular

126
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:34,890
muscles. So we're
going to start with

127
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:36,930
this one here called
the levator palpebrae

128
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,490
superioris. The name
kind of tells you

129
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:43,170
what it does levator
elevates the superior

130
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:47,710
eyelid in terms of its
origin it's from the

131
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:50,710
lesser wing of the
sphenoid and it starts

132
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:53,030
on that superior
tarsus the upper eyelid

133
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:56,090
and it also contains
some smooth muscle

134
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:59,910
fibers this view here
shows if you had removed

135
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:01,680
the brain or
approaching the orbit

136
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,130
superiorly break through
and remove that roof

137
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:07,490
of the orbit you can
see this first muscle

138
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:11,250
here is the levator
palpebrae superioris.

139
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:15,690
Next, we have four
****** muscles.

140
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:18,150
There's a superior,
inferior, and medial

141
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:21,610
and lateral ******.
All of these muscles

142
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:24,390
attach from this structure
here in the posterior

143
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:26,610
side of the orbit,
which is called the

144
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:29,350
common tendinus ring.
That common tendinus

145
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:31,570
ring is also attached
to the lesser wing

146
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:33,990
of the sphenoid. These
muscles essentially

147
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:36,490
go anteriorly, and
they're going to attach

148
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:40,390
to the sclera just
posterior to the cornea.

149
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:45,890
Then we have two
oblique muscles. So

150
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:48,050
first we have the
superior oblique.

151
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:50,890
That too is going to
originate from the

152
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:52,470
lesser wing of the
sphenoid. It's going

153
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:55,890
to go anteriorly, pass
through this little

154
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:58,010
muscular sling
called the trochlea,

155
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:00,790
which redirects the
muscle fibers posterior

156
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:03,630
laterally and then
it attaches on the

157
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:06,550
sclera on the superior
side of the eye.

158
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:09,890
The inferior oblique
has its origin here

159
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:12,190
on the medial side
of the orbit passes

160
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:14,450
laterally and a
little posteriorly to

161
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:17,210
attach to the inferior
side of the eye a

162
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:20,570
little deep here to
the lateral ******.

163
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:24,670
Now in terms of the
innervations of the

164
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:26,770
muscles one way to
remember is by this kind

165
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:29,130
of sort of fake
chemical formula here,

166
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:34,590
SO4LR6A03. So SO stands
for superior oblique.

167
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:37,890
The 4 indicates it's
innervated by the

168
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:41,650
fourth cranial nerve.
LR stands for lateral

169
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:44,550
******. The 6 indicates
it's innervated by

170
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:47,530
the sixth cranial
nerve. AO stands for all

171
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:50,550
others. And 3 is the
third cranial nerve.

172
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:54,290
these cranial nerves
also have other names

173
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:56,590
so the fourth is also
called the trochlear

174
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:59,210
nerve and one other
way to sort of

175
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:01,650
remember this is that
you remember the superior

176
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:04,350
oblique passed through
that trochlea that

177
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:07,850
little muscular that
little sling and so

178
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:10,770
another name for the
fourth cranial nerve

179
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:15,020
is the trochlear
nerve then the lateral

180
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,310
****** attaches to the
lateral side of the

181
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:19,190
eye. When it contracts,
it's going to

182
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:22,250
abduct the eye. And so
another name for the

183
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,790
sixth cranial nerve
is the abducens nerve.

184
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,130
And finally, just
going back to the

185
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:30,850
superior tarsal muscle
that's kind of embedded

186
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:33,450
or part of that
levator palpebrae

187
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:36,530
superioris, it's
innervated by post

188
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:40,070
-ganglionic sympathetics
whose cell bodies

189
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:42,490
reside in the superior
cervical ganglion.

190
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:47,750
Okay, so that's the
end of this first

191
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,490
of four videos. Next,
we'll be talking

192
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:53,070
about simple
movements of the eye,

193
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,950
and I look forward
to seeing you then.

194
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:59,450
Okay, so this
objective we covered

195
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:01,630
in the first four
videos. In this

196
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:03,430
video, by the end
of it, you should be

197
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:05,110
able to differentiate
actions and

198
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:07,430
functions of the
extraocular muscles.

199
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:11,010
and in terms of content
we're really going

200
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:13,090
to focus on the simple
movements of the eye

201
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:17,210
in this video okay so
let's talk a little

202
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:19,410
bit about terminology
and actions of the

203
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:21,930
eyeball so here we have a
patient looking straight

204
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:25,650
at us um kind of
facing us so this would

205
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:29,050
be called primary
position if the eye looks

206
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:32,330
upward that would be
called elevation eye

207
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:34,890
looking downward
that's depression. Eye

208
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:37,010
looking over towards
the nose or the medial

209
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:40,470
side, that's adduction.
Eye looking over towards

210
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:42,210
the lateral side,
that would be called

211
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:46,130
abduction. If the eye
is rotating this way,

212
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:49,570
that's called extortion.
And the eye rotating

213
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:52,530
this way, that would
be called intorsion.

214
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:56,930
Now, in terms of this
differentiating action

215
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,090
and function of the
extraocular muscles,

216
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,050
action is what a
muscle would do in

217
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:04,530
isolation whereas a
muscle's function is how

218
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:06,410
it actually contributes
to a particular

219
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:10,010
motion now sometimes
these are the same an

220
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:12,170
example of one of the
muscles from the first

221
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:14,810
video was the levator
palpebrae superioris

222
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:18,070
its only antagonist
is gravity so if that

223
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:21,030
muscle contracts its
action and function

224
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:24,110
are the same the
superior eyelid elevates

225
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,760
here we have sort of
a schematic image of

226
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,190
the head in superior
view sort of like what

227
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:36,210
we might see in an
axial ct or mri and all

228
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:39,790
of here are the two
orbits and as you remember

229
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:42,030
their boundaries are
primarily made up of

230
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:44,950
bone this blue line
indicates the axis of

231
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:48,170
the orbit it's not
going straight anterior

232
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:50,990
posteriorly it's at sort
of an angle and it's

233
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:54,150
fixed it doesn't
change by contrast the

234
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:57,030
axis of the eyeball varies.
Here it's in primary

235
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,670
position looking
forward, but of course

236
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:01,960
the eye can look many
different directions.

237
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:03,770
And the fact that these

238
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:05,520
two are often offset

239
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:08,390
causes a lot of
complexity in

240
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:11,990
understanding the functions
of the extraocular

241
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:13,730
muscles. In this
video, we're

242
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:15,290
going to start with
the simple cases.

243
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:18,850
So here we have
an eye in primary

244
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:21,170
position, looking
straight forward,

245
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:22,910
if we contract
the lateral

246
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:25,110
******, the eye is
going to abduct.

247
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:28,170
Now the optical
axis and the orbital

248
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:30,810
axis are aligned.
If we contract the

249
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:33,850
superior ******,
the eye elevates.

250
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:38,070
If we then contract
the inferior ******,

251
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:41,030
the abducted
eye depresses.

252
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:45,670
now again starting in
primary position if

253
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:48,630
we contract the medial
****** the eye is

254
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:51,250
going to adduct
now notice here the

255
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,470
superior oblique here
passing through that

256
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:56,610
trochlea because it
goes through that and

257
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:58,710
the fibers then go
posterior laterally

258
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:01,470
essentially this muscle
is pulling from the

259
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,390
front of the eye this
is different than

260
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,030
what we saw with the
****** muscles that

261
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:07,630
all attached to that
common tendinous ring.

262
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:11,930
So if the superior
oblique contracts,

263
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:15,310
then the adducted eye
is going to depress.

264
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,790
Then if we can
kind of see through

265
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,310
the eye here to
see the inferior

266
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:22,630
oblique attaching on
its inferior side,

267
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:25,650
if the inferior
oblique contracts,

268
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,010
then the eye elevates.

269
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:32,170
So just to summarize
these simple cases,

270
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:35,170
the superior ******
is a strong elevator

271
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:37,910
of the already A
-B ducted eyeball.

272
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:40,630
By contrast, the
inferior ******

273
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,470
is a strong depressor of

274
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,350
the already A-B
ducted eyeball.

275
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:47,310
The inferior oblique
is a strong elevator

276
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:50,170
of the already A
-deducted eye, and

277
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,910
the superior
oblique is a strong

278
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:54,890
depressor of the
already A-deducted eye.

279
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:58,410
so that's the end
of this second video

280
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:01,190
we'll next deal with
complex movements of the

281
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:04,210
eye i look forward to
seeing you then okay

282
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:06,590
so these first two
objectives we covered

283
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:08,990
in the first and
second videos here here

284
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:11,010
in the third by the
end of this session

285
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:12,650
you should be able
to describe how extra

286
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:15,150
ocular muscles work
in pairs to induce or

287
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:18,310
avoid torsion you
should also be able to

288
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:20,530
describe how the extra
ocular muscles work in

289
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:23,030
pairs to move the eye
in primary position

290
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,470
and we can kind
of summarize

291
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:28,950
this video really
focused on the

292
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,530
complex movements
of the eye

293
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:33,530
so I'm going to spend
some time going over

294
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:35,190
this particular image
here you'll find

295
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,050
something like this in
your textbook and it's

296
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:39,030
pretty much in most
anatomical textbooks

297
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:41,590
when they talk about
the extraocular muscles

298
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:44,990
in some ways this
image is very confusing

299
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,530
but because it sort
of can be confused

300
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:50,050
with another image
that really gets to how

301
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:53,670
can you identify where
a particular lesion

302
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:57,410
is on a nerve that
innervates a muscle of

303
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:59,990
the eye we need to spend
some time going over

304
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:02,550
it first thing to
focus on is this image

305
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,430
is looking at actions
not function right so

306
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:07,610
this is if one single
extraocular muscle

307
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:10,610
is going to contract
that is not typically

308
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:12,690
the case with a lot of
movements of the eye.

309
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:14,790
So this is sort of a
unique situation here

310
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:18,130
when we're looking at
this particular image.

311
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:20,690
The other key thing,
and this is probably

312
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:24,030
the most important,
is this only applies

313
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:27,310
to the eye in primary
position. That means

314
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:29,350
the patient's looking
straight ahead.

315
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:31,570
The minute the eye
deviates from primary

316
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,790
position, it's going to
get more complicated,

317
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,250
a little bit different
than what this

318
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:38,130
particular image
portrays. So just to

319
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:40,690
go through here, these
letters here, I-O-L

320
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:43,170
-R-S-O, These all
refer to our different

321
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:45,490
muscles, superior
******, medial ******,

322
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:48,350
inferior ******.
And then what you'll

323
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:50,450
notice here, these
kind of larger arrows

324
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:53,050
and smaller arrows.
So if we start

325
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:54,830
with things that
sort of make sense

326
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:57,530
here, like medial
******, it's a fairly

327
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,770
straightforward
movement. It contracts,

328
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:02,570
and the eye is going
to be adducted.

329
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:06,530
Similar with lateral
******, that muscle

330
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,410
contracts. The
eye is going to be

331
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:10,890
abducted. But then we
see things a little

332
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:13,390
more confusing here
with like superior

333
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:16,150
****** here. We see
this angled elevation,

334
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:18,190
but also this other
little line here.

335
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:21,010
What's actually happening
here is that the

336
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:23,070
eye is essentially a
sphere. So whenever

337
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:25,850
you pull on a ball,
it basically moves

338
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:28,490
much like a wheel with
an axis of rotation.

339
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:31,170
So the actual
movement is a curved

340
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:33,270
line or an arc. And
what they've done

341
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:36,370
here is split that
curved arc movement

342
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:38,750
into a series of
orthogonal vectors.

343
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:41,350
I find that somewhat
confusing, and so

344
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,710
I'm going to spend
some time showing

345
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,510
some other images that
I think are really

346
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,030
going to make a lot
more sense to you.

347
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:52,730
So where these complex
movements come from

348
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:55,030
this fact that the axis
of the orbit, which

349
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:57,830
is fixed, is often
at an angle from the

350
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:59,930
axis of the eyeball.
And whenever that

351
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:03,510
happens, if one muscle
is going to contract,

352
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:05,010
in all likelihood,
there's going to be some

353
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:07,890
torsion that's going
to also accompany

354
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:10,470
either the elevation
or the depression. Now,

355
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,430
there are cases
where we want to have

356
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,690
torsion. If we're tilting
our head to one side

357
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:16,650
or the other, we
want a little bit of

358
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:19,870
intorsion or extorsion
to maintain a level gaze.

359
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:22,090
But more often than
not, torsion is

360
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:25,330
something to avoid. And
so to avoid the torsion

361
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:27,230
when the axis of the
eyeball and the axis

362
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:29,200
of the orbit are not
in line, basically

363
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,850
multiple muscles have
to contract at once.

364
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:36,610
So let me walk through
this image here. It's

365
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:38,630
a schematic image of
kind of the superior

366
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:41,350
view of the head. You
can see the nose here.

367
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:45,610
And this red arrow on
this side is basically

368
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:48,770
referring to the
vector of movement for

369
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:51,350
the inferior and superior
******, right? So

370
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:52,970
they're going to pull
either on the superior

371
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,270
or inferior side of
the sclera like this,

372
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:59,170
back towards the posterior
or the apex of the

373
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:02,130
orbit. So the axis of
rotation is just 90

374
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:04,070
degrees to the
direction of the muscle

375
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:07,250
pulling, right? So
essentially, if we project

376
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:11,830
this axis of rotation
out, it would appear

377
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:14,530
right here on the medial
corner of the eye. So

378
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:16,910
this is for inferior
and superior ******.

379
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:19,210
Then if we go on
the other eye,

380
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:21,910
this vector here
is really showing

381
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:23,390
kind of the way
that both the

382
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:26,250
inferior and superior
oblique pull.

383
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:30,290
And so, again, the
axis of rotation is

384
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:33,030
90 degrees to that. If
we project that out,

385
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:35,250
that comes out in
the lateral corner

386
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,510
of the eye. Now, of
course, there's inferior

387
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:40,290
and superior ******
on both orbits as

388
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:42,590
well as inferior and
superior oblique.

389
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:46,470
So this image here
would just show the axis

390
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:48,950
of rotation of all
these muscles on both

391
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:51,850
eyes. Again, so here we
have axis of rotation

392
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:55,310
of superior and inferior
******, and here

393
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:59,450
we would have superior
and inferior oblique.

394
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:03,170
Now, if we have
the patient looking

395
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:05,070
straight at us in
primary position,

396
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,970
here is the axis
of rotation of the

397
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:11,030
superior ****** and
inferior ******.

398
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:13,770
and here in that
lateral corner is the

399
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:15,690
axis of rotation
of the superior

400
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:18,430
oblique and inferior
oblique. So let's

401
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,250
say this patient
is going to elevate

402
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,790
their eye starting
in primary position.

403
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:26,330
So if they were
just to contract the

404
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:28,610
superior ******,
you would get this

405
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:30,330
arc of movement,
which is essentially

406
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:32,230
going around this
axis of rotation

407
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:34,350
for the superior
and inferior ******.

408
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:38,290
If they also at the
same time, right,

409
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:40,910
or let's just say
they just contract the

410
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:44,330
inferior oblique, it too
will go around its axis

411
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:47,450
of rotation right here.
But if they contract

412
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:49,710
both of these muscles
at the same time,

413
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:52,930
the torsion effects are
going to cancel out.

414
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:57,030
You're going to get
smooth elevation.

415
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,570
In this case, the
superior ****** is doing

416
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:03,810
intorsion, inferior
obliques doing extorsion,

417
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:06,250
and those cancel out
smooth elevation.

418
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:11,190
So we just talked a
little bit about primary

419
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:13,610
position. And so one
way to think about

420
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:16,530
that is in primary
position, roughly you got

421
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:20,870
kind of 50-50 in terms
of the contraction of

422
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:23,670
the superior ******
and inferior oblique.

423
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:26,250
and this would be
elevation without any

424
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,480
sort of torsion. So
this little schematic

425
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,450
image, you have more
contraction, less

426
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:32,850
contraction. Here's the
abeducted eye. Here's

427
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:35,310
primary position.
Here's the adeducted

428
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:38,130
eye. If you remember
from the last video,

429
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:39,890
if you have the abeducted
eye, pretty much

430
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:42,470
the only thing you
need to do to elevate

431
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:45,120
the eye without any
sort of torsion is

432
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,430
contract superior
******. So all superior

433
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:49,610
******, no inferior
oblique. By contrast

434
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:51,550
with the adeducted
eye, if you remember,

435
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:53,590
You just need to
contract the inferior

436
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:55,710
oblique, nothing
else, and you'll

437
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:57,690
get elevation without
torsion. So you

438
00:19:57,690 --> 00:19:59,630
can imagine at this
point right here,

439
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:02,790
you might need
about, you know, 75%

440
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:07,310
superior ******, 25
% inferior obliques.

441
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,070
And we would see the same

442
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,230
thing on the other eye.

443
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:15,450
What about depression?
So if the patient

444
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:17,710
wants to press their
eye, they're going to

445
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:20,170
do inferior ******,
right? it would rotate

446
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:23,210
around this axis
superior oblique would

447
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:25,950
rotate around this axis
this would be intorsion

448
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:30,070
this would be extorsion
but essentially

449
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:32,010
their torsion effects
are going to cancel

450
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:33,720
out and you're going to
get smooth depression

451
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,260
now let's say if
we wanted torsion

452
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:43,090
without any elevation or
depression so both the

453
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:45,610
superior ****** and
the superior oblique

454
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:47,830
attached to the superior
side of the eye.

455
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:51,090
So you can see if
these muscle bellies

456
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:53,770
shorten, the eye is
just going to rotate

457
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:55,010
like this. Of course,
it's not going

458
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:57,090
to go all the way
around, be more subtle,

459
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,890
but this would be
the direction of

460
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:01,990
rotation. This is
intorsion. Remember the

461
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:04,330
superior ******, that
causes elevation,

462
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:05,190
intorsion.

463
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:08,190
Superior oblique
causes depression and

464
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:10,250
intorsion. So in
this case, if you

465
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,490
contract both of
these muscles the

466
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:15,450
elevation and the
depression will cancel

467
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:18,610
out and you'll get
smooth intorsion.

468
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:28,090
Then looking at depression
and extortion and

469
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:31,130
and how this relates
to the canceling out

470
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:34,730
with elevation here if
we contract both the

471
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:37,790
inferior ****** and the
inferior oblique and

472
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:39,550
these muscle bellies
are going to shorten.

473
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:42,810
The eye would rotate
in this direction.

474
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:45,950
That's extorsion.
The elevation of the

475
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:48,190
inferior oblique is
going to cancel out with

476
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:52,470
the depression of
the inferior ******,

477
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:54,820
and you're going to
get smooth extorsion.

478
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:00,810
Okay, so this is the end

479
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:02,290
of this particular video.

480
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:05,290
Next, we're really
going to kind of go to

481
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:07,250
the next step which
is sort of applying

482
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,270
this information to
understanding what's

483
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:11,150
affecting a particular
patient so that'll

484
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:14,130
be nerve lesions and
extraocular muscles

485
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:16,570
i look forward to
seeing you then

486
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,010
okay so in
terms of session

487
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:21,930
objectives we've
covered in these

488
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:24,350
four in the previous
three videos

489
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:27,010
now in this video
which is kind of more

490
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:29,550
clinically relevant
one we're going to

491
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:30,730
at the end of it you
should be able to

492
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:32,530
predict lesions and
nerves of the orbit

493
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:35,070
based on test of
extraocular muscles.

494
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:38,670
We're going to focus
on really nerve

495
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:41,530
lesions here, but in
reality, at least with

496
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:43,050
the information I'm
going to be providing

497
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:44,690
to you, it would
be difficult to

498
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:46,550
tell whether the problem
is with a particular

499
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:49,130
nerve or the muscle
it innervates.

500
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:54,690
Okay, so the
key thing with

501
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:56,450
this particular
image here,

502
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:59,690
and it might look
familiar to you, right? We

503
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:02,110
have a series of
extraocular muscles, right?

504
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,910
Inferior oblique,
medial ******, and we

505
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:06,070
have the eye here. You
might say, oh, this

506
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,870
looks familiar to me.
I've seen this before

507
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:11,190
because it looks a lot
like a chart that I

508
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:13,610
showed at the beginning
of the previous video.

509
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:16,750
And students often
confuse the two, but

510
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:19,070
this is very, very
different. So let me

511
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:21,670
just go back to review.
That previous image

512
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:24,930
was looking at or
trying to describe

513
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:28,030
the actions of the
extraocular muscles with

514
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:30,630
the eye in primary
position. It's somewhat

515
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:32,550
theoretical. It's
basically saying if

516
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:35,270
your patient's looking
ahead, you could

517
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:37,510
somehow tell them just,
you know, contract

518
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:40,270
the superior ******,
what would the eye

519
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:42,730
do when it starts
in primary position?

520
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:46,790
This image is something
very different.

521
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:48,950
So this is much more
clinically relevant.

522
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:51,570
And basically what
it's saying is this

523
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:53,810
is how you want the
patient to move their

524
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:56,750
eye try to figure out
where a particular

525
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:59,290
problem is or at
least to test the

526
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:01,890
function of all their
extraocular muscles

527
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:06,270
and so that previous
schematic diagram

528
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:09,130
was all about primary
position this one

529
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:11,410
is not basically what
you want to do is

530
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:13,550
get the patient out
of primary position

531
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:15,050
because you remember
primary position

532
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:17,550
is complicated. You
need two muscles to

533
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:20,910
create intorsion,
two muscles to create

534
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:23,950
extorsion, two to
elevate, two to depress

535
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:28,010
the eye. And so if you
see a problem there,

536
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:29,430
it's hard to know
which of the muscles

537
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:31,170
or which of the nerves
that are innervating

538
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:33,690
those muscles is not
working properly.

539
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:37,090
So what you want to do
with your patient is

540
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:39,810
get them to move the
eye out of primary

541
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:42,490
position, and then you
have a reasonable shot

542
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:44,110
of figuring out what
the problem is. So

543
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:45,810
you're going to ask
the patient to kind of

544
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:48,730
create this H pattern
by either following

545
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:50,970
your finger or maybe
a flashlight and then

546
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:53,390
seeing if the patient can
do all these movements.

547
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:54,920
So let's say we
start with primary

548
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,390
position, but now we
want to get the eye out

549
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:59,750
of primary position.
We ask the patient to

550
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,450
adduct the eye. They
can do that. That

551
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:04,810
tells us medial ******
is working well.

552
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:07,790
Then you want to depress
the adducted eye.

553
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:10,150
Check superior
oblique's working well.

554
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:13,010
Elevate the adducted
eye. Inferior

555
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:14,830
oblique is
working well. And

556
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:16,990
go back to kind
of a level gaze,

557
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:19,110
abeduct the eye, lateral

558
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,670
****** is working, check.

559
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:22,950
Depress the
abeducted eye,

560
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:25,050
inferior ******
is working, check.

561
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:28,890
Elevate the abeducted
eye, superior ******

562
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:31,390
is working, check.
So essentially what

563
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:33,430
we're doing here is
we're moving the eye

564
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:35,650
to these extreme
corners where we're sort

565
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:39,090
of forcing function
to equal action and

566
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:41,610
in a place where
really only one single

567
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:45,050
muscle is causing the
observed movement.

568
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:48,590
So let's apply
this kind of

569
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:50,070
thinking to a
couple patients.

570
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:52,290
So here, let's say
we have this patient

571
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:55,160
present here. First
thing you notice is this

572
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,530
eye is closed, right?
We call this ptosis.

573
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:59,390
And so this is our first

574
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:00,930
hint of what's
going on here.

575
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:04,110
If you remember,
there are some smooth

576
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:06,970
muscle fibers in the
levator palpebrae

577
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:09,690
superioris. superior
auras that are being

578
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:13,130
innervated by a sympathetic
to a cell body or

579
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:16,310
in that superior cervical
ganglion. So this

580
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:18,530
is a first hint that
the ocular motor

581
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:21,620
nerve is not working
properly because those

582
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,870
nerve fibers travel
in the ocular motor

583
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:27,490
nerve. Now, if we
force open that eyelid,

584
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:29,530
ask the patient to
look straight ahead,

585
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:32,270
we see this eye is
working fine. This

586
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:34,190
one definitely not,
and we kind of refer

587
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:36,690
to this condition
as down and out. So

588
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:38,690
I haven't talked much
about antagonists

589
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:40,410
at this point, but
that's really what's

590
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:42,250
going on here. So
if the ocular motor

591
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:45,390
nerve in its entirety
is knocked out,

592
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:47,590
right, superior
****** not

593
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:49,910
working, inferior
oblique not working,

594
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:51,670
medial ******
not working,

595
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:53,730
inferior ******
not working.

596
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:56,170
So the only things
left, right,

597
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:58,790
are going to be
the lateral ******,

598
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:00,310
which is innervated
by the abducens

599
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:02,570
nerve, and the
superior oblique, which

600
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:04,530
is innervated by
the trochlear nerve.

601
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:07,650
Lateral ****** is going
to be able to abduct

602
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:10,190
the eye because
there's no antagonist.

603
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:12,650
The medial ****** is
not working, so that's

604
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:15,830
the out part. And
then the superior

605
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:17,890
oblique is going to
depress the eye because

606
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:21,010
the superior ******
and inferior oblique

607
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:23,190
are not working, so
that's the down part.

608
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:27,340
Now, one other thing
to remember about the

609
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:29,430
ocular motor nerve,
this is sort of the

610
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:31,490
condition where the
entire nerve has a

611
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:34,050
lesion on, it's not
working. But do remember

612
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:36,370
that the acromotor
nerve splits into a

613
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:39,890
superior and an inferior
division. Do superior

614
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:43,710
division innervates
the levator palpebrae

615
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:46,430
superioris and the
superior ******,

616
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:49,150
whereas the inferior
division is going to

617
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:53,390
innervate the inferior
oblique medial ******

618
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:55,210
and inferior ******.
So you could also

619
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:57,530
have some slight
differences in how a

620
00:27:57,530 --> 00:28:00,130
patient presents,
depending on whether that

621
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:03,110
lesion's on the
superior division or the

622
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:05,410
inferior division of
the oculomotor nerve.

623
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,930
So now we're looking
at probably the hardest

624
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:10,910
case to kind of wrap
your mind around.

625
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:13,910
So here, you know,
we have a patient,

626
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:16,090
they're tilting their
head to one side to

627
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:18,150
maintain that level
gaze. We want the

628
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:20,440
eye to undergo smooth
torsion without

629
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:23,010
elevation or depression.
And the eyes would

630
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:25,050
do different kind
of opposite types of

631
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:27,730
torsion, right? So
here we have the left

632
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:31,590
eye, it's undergoing
intorsion, and then

633
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:34,230
the other eye is
undergoing extorsion.

634
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:35,930
Everything looks fine,

635
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:37,770
right? Gaze
straight ahead.

636
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:40,410
But now when we have
the patient tilt

637
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:42,190
their head to the other
side, right, we've

638
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:44,770
flipped the required
torsion for each

639
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:48,250
eye. So now this eye
is undergoing extorsion

640
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:51,030
and this one's
undergoing intorsion.

641
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:53,990
This eye still looks
fine, looking straight

642
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:56,310
at us. But here I
think you can see that

643
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:58,590
this eye sort of deviated
a little bit to go

644
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:02,130
up. So what's happening
here? To create

645
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:04,770
intorsion, to smooth
intorsion, what you want is

646
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:06,950
both muscles that
attach to the superior

647
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:09,130
side of the eye, that's
the superior oblique

648
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:11,850
and the superior ******
to contract at the

649
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:15,890
same time. They both
cause intorsion. Remember,

650
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:17,570
the superior ******
is going to cause

651
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:20,770
elevation of the eye if
it acts alone, and the

652
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:23,350
superior oblique will
cause depression of

653
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:26,490
the eye if it acts
alone. So that elevation

654
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:29,250
of depression should
cancel out and we get

655
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:33,310
smooth intorsion. When
we see the eye elevating

656
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:37,050
here, that's telling
us that the antagonist

657
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:40,090
of the superior
****** is not working.

658
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:43,110
So now what we're seeing
is only the action

659
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:45,850
of the superior ******,
which is the cause

660
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:49,410
and torsion of the eye,
but also elevation.

661
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:53,550
And so that tells
us really that that

662
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:55,390
antagonist is
superior oblique or

663
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:57,090
the nerve that
innervates that the

664
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:59,110
trochlear nerve is
not working properly.

665
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:02,130
And so this is
sort of called the

666
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:04,790
Bischowski sign. And
basically whenever the

667
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:07,650
head is tilted to
the affected side,

668
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:09,990
you're going to see
this slight elevation

669
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:12,590
of the eye. We could
further test this,

670
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:14,050
right, by having the
patient look straight

671
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:16,150
ahead, not tilt
their head, do that

672
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:17,930
H pattern, and we
would predict that

673
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:20,690
they could not depress
the adducted eye.

674
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:26,990
Okay, so this is our
summary slide from all

675
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:28,970
four videos. Let's just
kind of review what

676
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:30,530
you should be able
to do at this point

677
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:32,990
after watching these
videos. So remember

678
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:35,390
contents of the orbiter,
not compressible.

679
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:37,590
There's a lot of either
either there's a fluid

680
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:39,870
in the eye itself or
the adipose tissue

681
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:42,730
essentially acts as a fluid.
It's not compressible.

682
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:44,530
So if there's a
lot of pressure in

683
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:46,610
the eye that's going
to require defects in

684
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:49,890
the base or the walls
of the orbit and you

685
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:52,810
could very possibly
get a blowout fracture.

686
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:56,090
Remember action and
function often mean very

687
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:58,450
different things for
extraocular muscles.

688
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:02,570
The torsion in the
eye occurs when the

689
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:05,970
optic axis is at an
angle to the axis of

690
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:07,670
the orbit. And that
happens quite a bit

691
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:09,250
because remember
the most common is

692
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:11,350
primary position
looking straight ahead.

693
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:13,830
Now torsion is not
always a bad thing.

694
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,370
You want to have
that intorsion or

695
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:17,450
extorsion when you're
tilting your head.

696
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:22,290
Action and function
are usually described

697
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:24,630
relative to primary position
so if you're looking

698
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:27,110
in a textbook trying
to see what's the

699
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:29,250
the action or the
function of a particular

700
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:31,530
extraocular muscle that's
in primary position

701
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:34,410
but remember stating
the obvious you can look

702
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:36,830
many different ways
and in those different

703
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:39,670
orientations particular
extra ocular muscle

704
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:42,410
is going to have a
different function and then

705
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:44,770
finally extraocular
muscle function is

706
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:47,910
tested by having the
patient not look in primary

707
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:50,470
position so you want to
get it out of complex

708
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:53,150
areas and move it
to those simple more

709
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:57,890
extreme corners of the
eye okay so that's the

710
00:31:57,890 --> 00:32:01,470
end of this video if
you have any questions

711
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:03,690
about the orbiter
extraocular muscles please
