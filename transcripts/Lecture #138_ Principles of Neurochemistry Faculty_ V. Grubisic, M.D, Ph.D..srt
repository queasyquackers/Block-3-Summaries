00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,990
Hello, my name is
Vladimir Grubišić

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:05,090
and I am an assistant
professor in the

3
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:07,010
Department of
Biomedical Sciences.

4
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:09,590
In this session,
I will be talking

5
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:12,590
on principles of
neurochemistry with

6
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:14,810
the emphasis on
neurotransmission.

7
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:19,590
The objectives of
this lecture are to

8
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,510
understand principles
of neurotransmission and

9
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:25,810
actions of key
neurotransmitters. You will

10
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:28,250
learn locations in
the brain of the key

11
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,670
neurotransmitters, so
where they are produced and

12
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:34,630
where they are released,
and how they act.

13
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:37,910
Another objective is
to understand basic

14
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:40,730
principles of
neurotransmitter synthesis and

15
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:43,870
degradation, and how
these functions contribute

16
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:46,670
to the disorders of
the nervous system.

17
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:51,050
First, a quick
revision that the brain

18
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:54,170
has several different
cell types. neurons

19
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:58,170
here in yellow, glia
cells, endothelial

20
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,670
cells and many other
cell types that

21
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:02,970
all contribute
with their specific

22
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:05,950
functions to the overall
brain physiology.

23
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:09,990
This is a very simplified
overview and all

24
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,950
these cells have
different subtypes. For

25
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:15,310
example, there are
many different types of

26
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:17,330
neurons in the brain.
They have different

27
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:20,690
sizes and distinct
morphologies and they

28
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:23,710
have different effects
on the brain function.

29
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:26,590
Later in this session
we will be going

30
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:29,630
over excitatory and
inhibitory neurons and

31
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:32,530
basic classification
based on their key

32
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:34,930
neuron transmitters
that they are producing.

33
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,590
There are several
glial cell types

34
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,510
that support
neuronal functions.

35
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:43,630
Azocytes here in green
are closely associated

36
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:46,470
with blood vessels
and neurons. They

37
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,270
provide neurons with
the metabolic fuel and

38
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:52,810
clear waste left after
neuronal activity.

39
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,050
Oligodendrocytes
here in blue produce

40
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,470
myelin to grab
and insulate

41
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:02,190
neuronal axons
which enhances the

42
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,530
speed of action
potential traveling.

43
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:07,650
Microglia are
resident immune

44
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:09,770
cells in the brain
and essential for

45
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,950
immune responses
in the brain.

46
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:15,970
Endothelial cells here
in red are building

47
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:18,990
blocks of the brain
vasculature they make

48
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:22,990
the tube the most
inner part of the blood

49
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:26,290
vessels and form the
barrier between the

50
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:29,390
blood and the rest of
the brain tissue and you

51
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:32,090
will hear more about
this in another session

52
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,870
the other cell types
such as parasites

53
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:38,090
and epidemal cells are
important structural

54
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:41,170
and functional part
of the blood brain

55
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:44,870
barrier and ventricular
system respectively.

56
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,950
Other cells, mentioned
here, mediate

57
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:51,870
diverse brain
functions and become

58
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,230
ineffective in many
brain disorders.

59
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:57,490
The main concept
here I would like

60
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:59,890
you to learn is
that all cells

61
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:02,410
act as chemical
compartments and

62
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,790
there is clear division
of labor between

63
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:07,730
cell types in the
brain. For example,

64
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:13,250
People spend most
of the brain energy

65
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:16,170
on signaling, but
astrocytes do most

66
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:18,810
of the metabolic
work controlling the

67
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:21,290
composition of the
interstitial fluid.

68
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:25,070
They supply neurons
with energy substrates,

69
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:27,450
precursors for
biosynthesis,

70
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:30,790
recycling
neurotransmitters, and

71
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:32,910
clearing the
waste products.

72
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:35,930
Neurons cannot
survive with the

73
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:38,590
support from astrocytes
and all these

74
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,870
astrocytic functions
are essential

75
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,970
for proper
neuronal signaling.

76
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:46,010
I would like to
emphasize two of

77
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:47,670
these astrocytic
functions for

78
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,970
you to learn from
this session.

79
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,470
The first one is
called astrocytes

80
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:58,210
neuron lactate shuttle
and it shows that

81
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:01,150
major metabolic
fuel for neurons is

82
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:03,650
lactate that comes
from astrocytes.

83
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:06,590
The majority of
lactate generated in

84
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:09,290
astrocytes by
glycolysis is shuttled

85
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,990
to neurons via the
monocarboxylate

86
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:15,410
transporters and
gets used up in Krebs

87
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:18,390
cycle for their high
metabolic demands.

88
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,510
This pathway is
essential during

89
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,730
low blood glucose
levels when

90
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,870
the blood supply
is stopped,

91
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:28,070
for instance in ******.

92
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:31,530
Astrocytes then use
their glycogen stores

93
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:34,270
and supply the neurons
with metabolic fuel

94
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:38,350
in the form of
lactate. So this is the

95
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:41,370
lactate shuttle and
describes one-way trip

96
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:43,990
of lactate produced
in astrocytes into

97
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:48,010
neurons that use it
up for ATP production.

98
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:51,470
Another important
astrocytic function

99
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:54,250
is essential for neuron
transmission, and

100
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:57,090
it's called glutamate
or GABA glutamine

101
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:00,410
cycle. It shows
that glutamate or

102
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:03,130
GABA that are released
by neurons, they

103
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:05,890
get cleared up by
astrocytes through uptake

104
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:08,690
via excited to amino
acid transporters

105
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:11,050
or GABA transporters,
respectively.

106
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:14,830
In astrocytes, these
neuron transmitters are

107
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:18,770
converted into glutamine,
which gets released

108
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:22,070
and taken up by neurons,
and they convert

109
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:24,510
them into glutamate
or further down into

110
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:29,240
GABA. They package them
into vesicles and they

111
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:32,150
get released into
synaptic cleft to start

112
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:35,130
the cycle of neuron
transmission once again.

113
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:37,290
Let's talk more about

114
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:39,750
communication
between neurons.

115
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:44,350
This is an electron
micrograph of a part

116
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:47,170
of complex synaptic
arrangement called

117
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:49,890
lomerulus and it's
found in few regions

118
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:53,170
of the central
nervous system and for

119
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,810
us it's nicely
showing two kinds of

120
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:59,090
interneural communication
in one snapshot.

121
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:04,750
So on the left we see
two atritic spines

122
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,910
that are coupled by
gap junctions shown

123
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:11,090
here by these small
black arrows and this

124
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:14,570
is an example of
electrical synapse where

125
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:17,310
action potential
and associated ions

126
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:20,580
travel directly from
one neuron into another

127
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,210
through these gap
junctional channels

128
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:26,410
that connect the
cytoplasm of these cells

129
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:29,290
this kind of
communication is super

130
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:32,490
fast and without the
proper synaptic delay

131
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:38,570
On the upper
right side, we see

132
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:41,690
an image of an
action terminal

133
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:44,050
packaged with
synaptic vesicles.

134
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:47,550
Large arrowheads
point to the electron

135
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:51,230
-dense material that
makes the active zones

136
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:54,810
where the vesicles
are being released,

137
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:58,730
over here and over
here, and also where

138
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:02,150
the postsynaptic
densities are. Black

139
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:06,510
dots are immuno-gold
labeling for GABA,

140
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:09,950
identifying these
terminals as GABAergic.

141
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:13,130
And red arrowheads point

142
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:14,610
to synaptic vesicles.

143
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:17,350
You can see that
these vesicles are

144
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:19,590
clear, and they are
called clear vesicles.

145
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:22,270
And these kind of
vesicles are typical

146
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:24,930
for small molecule
neurotransmitters.

147
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:29,310
This is a chemical synapse
where communication

148
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:31,790
is mediated by
neurotransmitters.

149
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:34,250
In this scenario
neurotransmitters

150
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,850
are stored in vesicles.

151
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,310
These little
membrane envelop the

152
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:43,430
spheres of the
presynaptic terminals.

153
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:48,410
An action potential
comes to the

154
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:50,990
presynaptic nerve
terminal, opens

155
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:53,410
the voltage-gated
calcium channels,

156
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,670
which induce increase
in the local calcium

157
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:59,810
concentration and
trigger diffusion of the

158
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:02,810
vesicle membrane with
the cell membrane.

159
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:06,550
Neuron transmitters
get released into this

160
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:09,610
narrow space between
the presynaptic and

161
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:13,030
postsynaptic terminals
called synaptic cleft.

162
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:16,550
Then neuron transmitters
diffuse across

163
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:19,030
the synaptic cleft
and bind to the

164
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:21,490
receptors on the
postsynaptic terminal

165
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:24,990
causing different
actions through influx

166
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:27,510
of ions through
ionotropic channels

167
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,310
or generation of
second messengers

168
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:33,590
via metatropic receptors.

169
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,450
This kind of signaling
is characterized

170
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,730
by synaptic
delay because it

171
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:40,910
takes some time for
neurotransmitters

172
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:43,610
to diffuse across
the synaptic left,

173
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:47,950
but it also
amplifies the signal.

174
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,990
These kinds of
chemical synapses

175
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:53,450
are a predominant
kind of neuronal

176
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,230
communication
in the brain.

177
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,490
And right now
let's talk about

178
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:01,110
different kinds of
neurotransmitters.

179
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,850
Neurotransmitters
may be categorized

180
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,410
by their molecular
structure.

181
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,790
This cartoon
over here shows

182
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,930
some characteristics
of the small

183
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:13,550
molecular
neurotransmitters,

184
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,330
neuropeptides,

185
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:18,130
and gaseous transmitters

186
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:20,030
such as nitric oxide.

187
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:23,750
The most of neuron
transmitters

188
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:26,190
travel enterogradly,
so from

189
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,590
the presynaptic to
the postsynaptic

190
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:30,230
terminal as shown here,

191
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:32,710
and some neuron
transmitters travel in

192
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:35,210
the opposite direction
or retrogradly.

193
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:38,190
Gaseous neurotransmitters
such as nitric

194
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:41,370
oxide don't have
particular directionality

195
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:44,170
but rather diffuse
in all directions.

196
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:46,450
And we will hear more
about this special

197
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:49,210
neurotransmitter
later in this session.

198
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:53,970
Neuropeptides are
larger molecules made of

199
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:57,410
chains of several
amino acids. They are

200
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:59,790
synthesized in the cell
body where they get

201
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:03,950
packaged into large
electron-dense vesicles.

202
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,510
and then get transported

203
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,370
to the axon terminals.

204
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:12,190
Their action on
postsynaptic neurons is

205
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:15,810
mediated primarily by
metabotropic receptors.

206
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:19,950
Small molecule neuron
transmitters can be

207
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:23,730
further divided into
amines and amino acids

208
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:27,810
as in this table. They
are synthesized in

209
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:31,350
the axon terminals and
packaged into small

210
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:34,870
clear vesicles their
actions may be mediated

211
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:38,050
by both ionotropic and
metatropic receptors

212
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:40,710
and their signal is
then terminated by

213
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:43,290
enzymatic degradation
in the synaptic cleft

214
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:48,450
or and reuptake by
transporters on the

215
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:52,590
presynaptic membranes
where they get repackaged

216
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:55,470
into vesicles and
start the cycle again.

217
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:59,170
Please keep in mind that
many neurotransmitters

218
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:01,770
are not listed in
this table such

219
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:04,620
as other nucleotides
and nucleosides,

220
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:08,250
many other neuropeptides
and the cannabinoids

221
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,390
for instance as
a member of lipid

222
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:13,410
neurotransmitters and
many other bioactive

223
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:17,390
molecules and many
other categories.

224
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:21,870
Also keep in mind
that But real synapses

225
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,790
may release transmitters
from one or more

226
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:29,190
classes, and many
neuropeptides are co-released

227
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:32,020
with the non-peptide
neurotransmitters.

228
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,910
Here is a summary
of some key

229
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:39,490
differences between
the two, such as

230
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:42,370
the site of
synthesis and type of

231
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:44,410
vesicles as
previously mentioned.

232
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:48,390
Neuropeptides are also
usually synthesized

233
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:51,770
as a larger inactive
polypeptides that need

234
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:54,690
to be cleaned into
smaller active form.

235
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:57,470
These precursor
proteins usually

236
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:01,310
have pre and
or pro prefix.

237
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:03,250
For example,

238
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:07,190
pro-opiomelanocortin.
This is a precursor

239
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:09,470
peptide for three
different groups of

240
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:12,430
neuropeptides, just
as its name says.

241
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:15,470
Opio is for
beta-endorphin,

242
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,770
a member of an
opioid family.

243
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:20,390
Melanol is for melanocyte

244
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:23,190
-stimulating hormones.
And cortin is

245
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:26,510
for adenocorticotropic
hormone.

246
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:30,170
So one precursor
protein, pro-opio

247
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:33,080
-melanocortin, derives
several different

248
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:38,450
peptide neuron
transmitters and hormones.

249
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,950
Another important
distinction is

250
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:43,150
that actions of
neuropeptides are

251
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:45,410
mediated by
metabotropic receptors,

252
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:49,150
so their effects
are often delayed.

253
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:52,750
Neuropeptides also
linger longer in the

254
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,690
synaptic cleft,
and therefore their

255
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:58,090
actions are usually
longer than the small

256
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:00,670
molecule
neurotransmitters that are

257
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:03,090
quickly degraded in
the synaptic cleft and

258
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:06,150
taken up by the
presynaptic terminals.

259
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:11,110
This table also
reinforces the typical

260
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:14,830
life cycle of a
neurotransmitter that

261
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:17,310
goes from the synthesis
of a neurotransmitter

262
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:19,710
to the termination
of the signal.

263
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:23,390
Here it is once again.

264
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:26,550
Please note the steps
of the neurotransmitter

265
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:28,690
cycling from the
neurotransmitter

266
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:32,710
synthesis or production,
followed by storage or

267
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:35,850
packaging into vesicles,
release into the

268
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:38,270
synaptic cleft, and
interaction with the

269
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:41,590
postsynaptic receptors,
to finally termination

270
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:44,410
of the signal by
degradation, such as

271
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:46,490
the acetylcholine
degradation by

272
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,430
acetylcholinesterase, as
shown here in this image,

273
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:52,590
or reuptake to the
presynaptic terminal.

274
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:56,530
It is important to
know these steps and

275
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:59,630
their molecular mechanisms
because these are

276
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,550
the sites of action
for neurotoxins such as

277
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,370
botulinum toxin that
cleaves proteins

278
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:08,250
involved in vesicle
fusion in the presynaptic

279
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:11,800
terminal and release
of neurotransmitters or

280
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,010
insecticide poisoning
blocking the action

281
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:18,130
of acetylcholine
esterase and resulting in

282
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:22,290
the buildup of
acetylcholine at synapses.

283
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:26,350
Some disorders also
affect this cycle.

284
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:27,690
For example,

285
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:31,790
myasthenia gravis is
caused by antibodies

286
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:34,010
against the
acetylcholine receptors,

287
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:37,790
which block the normal
action of acetylcholine

288
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:41,330
in the neuromuscular
junctions and results

289
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:44,870
in muscle weakness.
and finally knowing

290
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:49,350
these steps allow
understanding of the key

291
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:53,790
actions of some drugs
for example L-DOPA is

292
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:56,350
dopamine precursor and
it's given to Parkinson

293
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:58,910
disease patients to
increase dopamine

294
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:02,550
production in dopamine
concentration in synapses

295
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:06,910
another example are
selective serotonin

296
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:11,410
reuptake inhibitors or
SSRIs such as Prozac,

297
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,530
that block the
serotonin transporters

298
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:18,390
increasing the serotonin
levels at the synapses.

299
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:22,870
This schematic,
however, is missing an

300
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:26,610
important player that
plays a role in the

301
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:29,170
neurotransmitter
clearance and has many

302
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:31,950
important functions
in synapse regulation.

303
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:35,310
Astrocytic
processes make the

304
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,990
third active
part of synapses.

305
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:43,300
The three-partite synapse
is another important

306
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,550
concept that I would
like you to learn.

307
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:49,190
On the left, we have
an electron micrograph

308
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,770
showing a presynaptic
terminal over

309
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:55,390
here, filled with
small clear vesicles,

310
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:59,770
and postsynaptic
terminal over here with

311
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:03,010
postsynaptic
densities where the

312
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:06,370
neurotransmitter receptors
are and also other

313
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:08,890
plasma membrane
scaffolding proteins.

314
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:12,330
These neuronal
terminals are unwrapped

315
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:15,670
by the astrocytic
process in this image

316
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:19,230
pseudocolored in
green and are forming

317
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:22,410
altogether the three
part-type synapse.

318
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:27,290
On the right is a
cartoon summarizing what

319
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:29,970
I just said and further
illustrating that

320
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:33,290
this astrocytic process
in green is not only

321
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:35,270
providing a structural
support for the

322
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:38,270
synapse but is essential
for clearing potassium

323
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:41,450
ions that accumulate
after the neuronal

324
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:44,770
activity and also
in the uptake of the

325
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:48,310
synaptic transmitter
glutamate by the activity

326
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:50,870
of plasma membrane
glutamate transporters.

327
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,670
In addition,

328
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:56,090
neurotransmitter
release from presynaptic

329
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:58,370
terminals can
activate astrocytic

330
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:01,650
metabotropic receptors,
which then induce

331
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:05,470
release of calcium from
internal astrocytic

332
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:08,230
stores and in turn
trigger the release

333
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:10,870
of several neuroactive
compounds known

334
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:13,950
as glia transmitters
from these cells.

335
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:17,750
This mechanism of
glia transmission has

336
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,110
been confirmed to
mediate many important

337
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:22,630
functions in the brain
such as breathing,

338
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:25,070
learning and
memory, and sleep.

339
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:28,970
Peripheral glia cells
also contribute to

340
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:31,450
many other important
functions in the body,

341
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:35,190
but that topic is for
some other session.

342
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:39,450
Now actions of any
neurotransmitter

343
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:42,910
are determined
by the receptors.

344
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:47,070
And this is another key

345
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,910
concept of neuron
transmission.

346
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:52,670
Fast actions are
mediated by ionotropic

347
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:55,750
receptors. These
are ligand-gated ion

348
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:59,150
channels that come
in two basic flavors.

349
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:02,590
If they are permeable
for positive ions

350
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:06,370
or cations such as
sodium and calcium,

351
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:09,610
their activity is making
the neuronal membrane

352
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:13,790
more positive or
causing depolarization,

353
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,930
which is increasing
the probability of

354
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:19,590
the neuron to fire
an action potential.

355
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:23,310
Therefore, these receptors
are fast excitatory

356
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,970
receptors, and
glutamate is the key

357
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:28,770
excitatory neuron
transmitter in the brain.

358
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:33,130
Fast inhibition,
on the other hand,

359
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:36,570
is mediated by
ligand-gated anion

360
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:38,890
channels, so channels
that are permeable

361
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:41,030
for negative ions
such as chloride.

362
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:44,990
When opened, these
channels are making the

363
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:48,830
membrane more
negative or causing
hyperpolarization,

364
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:51,690
which is then reducing
the probability

365
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:54,890
of that neuron to fire
an action potential.

366
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:58,530
GABA is the key inhibitory
neurotransmitter

367
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:01,310
in the brain while
glycine is the main

368
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:04,230
inhibitory transmitter
in the spinal cord.

369
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:07,130
On the other hand,

370
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:13,450
metabotropic receptors
mediate generation of

371
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:17,470
second messengers that
ultimately affect ion

372
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:20,730
channel conductance,
which means they affect

373
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:23,400
the flow of ions
through these channels

374
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,330
and this is why these
receptors are causing

375
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:31,390
much slower but usually
longer responses and

376
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:35,210
can lead to either
excitation or inhibition.

377
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:39,970
Receptor proteins
can be expressed

378
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,870
selectively in some
cells and not in

379
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:44,890
others in the
same brain regions

380
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:48,670
which creates the
ability to set up

381
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:51,250
complex neuronal
circuits and produce

382
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:56,750
behaviors that
allow adaptability

383
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:01,630
now neurons in
general produce

384
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:03,830
and release
only one kind of

385
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:06,410
the main amine
or amino acid

386
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:09,910
and that's how they
are classified so

387
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:13,390
GABAergic neurons release
GABA and dopaminergic

388
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:16,550
neurons release
dopamine. These neurons

389
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:19,790
may still co-release
other neuropeptides or

390
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:22,530
ATP but they do
not release other

391
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:25,990
neurotransmitters from
this class so glutamatergic

392
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:29,130
neurons do not release
GABA or serotonin.

393
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:32,430
Neurochemically these
neurons are identified

394
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:35,710
by expression of the
key enzymes needed

395
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,810
for the neurotransmitter
biosynthesis

396
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:41,470
or by specific
transporters that are

397
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:43,930
required for their
packaging into vesicles.

398
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:47,750
For example, all
cholinergic neurons

399
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,970
express
cholinacetyltransferase, and all

400
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:53,690
glutamatergic neurons
can be identified

401
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:55,990
through the detection
of vesicular

402
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:59,650
glutamate transporter,
or VGLUT, which

403
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:02,490
transports glutamate
into synaptic vesicles

404
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:06,310
of the presynaptic
glutamatergic terminals.

405
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:11,530
Blucomaturgic and
then GABAergic neurons

406
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:14,130
are the most and the
second most abundant

407
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:16,430
neuron types in the
brain, and these

408
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:18,830
neurons are scattered
throughout the brain.

409
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:21,190
On the other hand,

410
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:23,670
amine neurotransmitter
releasing neurons

411
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:26,190
are clustered
together in specific

412
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:29,410
small areas of the
brain called nuclei.

413
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:33,870
These nuclei do not
have anything to do with

414
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:37,190
the cell nuclei, They
are anatomical nuclei

415
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:40,290
describing clustered
cell bodies of neurons

416
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:42,930
with similar
neurochemical composition.

417
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:46,230
For instance, substantia
***** is one of

418
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:49,590
those where
dopaminergic neurons are

419
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:52,710
clustered together,
and this area is

420
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:55,630
particularly affected
in Parkinson's disease.

421
00:21:56,570 --> 00:22:00,150
We will go over these
key neurotransmitters

422
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:03,590
in the following slides.
And as you can see,

423
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:06,050
there is a striking
difference in the cell

424
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:09,930
body organization between
the amino acid and

425
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:12,590
amino neurotransmitter
-producing neurons.

426
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:17,890
The main excitatory
and inhibitory

427
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:20,730
neurotransmitters in
the brain are amino acid

428
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:24,210
transmitters glutamate
and GABA, respectively.

429
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:27,450
Glutamate is the
source of GABA

430
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:29,750
through conversion
of glutamate to

431
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:32,950
GABA by glutamic
acid decarboxylase.

432
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:36,530
Conversely, GABA is
converted to glutamate

433
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:39,710
via GABA transaminase.
So these two

434
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:42,490
neurotransmitters
represent the excitatory

435
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:45,010
and inhibitory
balance in the brain.

436
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:48,750
Let's first talk
about glutamate.

437
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:53,570
Glutamate is the
excitatory neurotransmitter

438
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:56,510
and is the most
prominent in the brain.

439
00:22:56,530 --> 00:23:00,610
Therefore, drugs that
potentiate glutamatergic

440
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:03,910
signaling, such as
***, can lead to

441
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:07,690
epilepsy and seizures.
And on the other hand,

442
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:11,010
drugs such as ketamine
and alcohol, among

443
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:13,690
others, interfere
with the glutamatergic

444
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:18,390
signaling and cause
depressive effects by

445
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:21,850
decreasing excitation
and reducing activity,

446
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:26,050
generally throughout
the brain. There are

447
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:29,490
three types of ionotropic
and eight subtypes

448
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:32,450
of metabolotropic
glutamate receptors that

449
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:35,510
in turn determine the
action of glutamine.

450
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:39,990
AMPA and canate
receptors are the main

451
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:43,110
ionotropic receptors
mediating fast

452
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:46,450
excitatory signal because
these channels once

453
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:49,490
opened allow the
passage of positively

454
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:52,450
charged ions and
cause depolarization.

455
00:23:53,230 --> 00:24:00,330
NMDA receptors are
different a little bit

456
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:04,690
closer look because
they act as co-incident

457
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:08,430
detectors which is
associated with memory

458
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:12,790
formation. These
receptors actually require

459
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:17,170
three situations to happen
in order to open the

460
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:21,030
channel. The first is
obviously binding of

461
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:23,890
glutamate or aspartate
for this reason but

462
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:27,850
aspartate is a less
potent agonist than

463
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:31,290
glutamate the second
requirement is binding of

464
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:35,710
coal ligands glycine
or d-serine and these

465
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:39,360
often come from
surrounding asfocytes even

466
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:42,570
with both ligand and
coal ligand attached to

467
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:44,970
the NND receptor the
channel pore is still

468
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:49,270
blocked by magnesium
ions and the polarization

469
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:52,390
is the third requirement
that kicks out

470
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:55,290
this magnesium and
finally opens the channel

471
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:58,690
and causing the
polarization this is why

472
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:02,070
these channels are called
coincidence detectors

473
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:05,350
it's because these
receptors require ligand

474
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:07,810
binding and the
polarization to happen

475
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:13,690
at the same time or
very close in time these

476
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:17,390
channels are associated
with the synaptic

477
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:20,370
plasticity changes during
learning and memory

478
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:23,730
there is a saying neurons
that fire together

479
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:28,430
wire together and it
talks about the increase

480
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:31,450
in synapse strength
when multiple signals

481
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:36,090
are input into
downstream neurons at the

482
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:39,990
same time. NMDA receptors
are the key mechanism

483
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:42,350
detecting these
multiple signals that

484
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:45,530
occur very close in
time and mediating the

485
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:48,870
changes in synaptic
plasticity and increasing

486
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:52,050
the strength of synapse
when this happens.

487
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:55,790
This is a way to
form new associations

488
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:58,990
between cellular
activity in the brain and

489
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:01,270
is associated with
learning and memory.

490
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:04,370
Changes to receptor
activity caused

491
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:07,130
by mutation of these
receptors associated

492
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:08,810
with different
neurological disorders

493
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:11,290
such as epilepsy,
schizophrenia,

494
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:13,650
and neurodevelopmental
disorders.

495
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,190
On the other hand,

496
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:21,470
GABA inhibits the
firing of neurons. GABA

497
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:24,030
opens channels that
allow passage of

498
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:27,990
negatively charged ions,
causes hyperparalization

499
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:30,070
of the downstream
neurons, which

500
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:32,670
makes that neuron less
likely to fire because

501
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:35,070
its member potential
is more negative.

502
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:39,050
Drugs such as ethanol
or benzodiazepines

503
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:41,950
enhance the activity
of GABA receptors.

504
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:44,310
They potentiate
inhibitory

505
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:45,470
signal in the brain.

506
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:48,530
Disorders such as
Huntington's disease

507
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:52,050
affect GABA production
in the striatum, the

508
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:53,860
brain center for
movement coordination,

509
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:56,810
And this loss of
inhibitory signaling or

510
00:26:56,810 --> 00:27:00,070
this inhibition leads
to uncontrollable

511
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:02,530
movements in patients
with Huntington's

512
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:05,250
disease. These cells
express dopamine

513
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:08,790
receptors. And we will
talk about this once

514
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:11,830
again during dopamine
signaling system.

515
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:20,310
GABA-8 channels mediate
fast inhibition and

516
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:22,410
let's briefly talk
about their function.

517
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:25,570
These are GABA
-gated channels that

518
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:27,770
need two GABA
molecules to bind the

519
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:29,790
receptors, to open
the channel and

520
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:32,490
allow chloride
ions into the cell.

521
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:35,310
This in turn
decreases the membrane

522
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:37,290
potential and
reduces the chance

523
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:39,370
of action-potational
firing. In other

524
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:41,730
words, it inhibits
that neuron.

525
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:47,150
Now, we will move on
to AMI transmitters.

526
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:52,670
The second column is the
main neurotransmitter

527
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:54,410
at the neuromuscular
junction,

528
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:56,870
where it mediates
voluntary

529
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:59,370
contractions of
somatic muscles.

530
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:02,100
It is also one
of the principal

531
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,990
neurotransmitters in the
autonomic nervous system.

532
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:08,390
It is the parasympathetic
neurotransmitter,

533
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:11,530
but it is also
released at the

534
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:14,650
preganglionic nerves of
the sympathetic system,

535
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:18,090
and also in the
enteric nervous system,

536
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:20,330
it causes intestinal
smooth muscle

537
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:23,470
contraction and the gut
epithelial secretions.

538
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:26,610
Acetylcholine is
also produced in the

539
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:30,690
brain, and choline
acetyltransferase, here on

540
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:33,110
the top, is the
important biosynthesis

541
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:36,730
enzyme. It is usually
abbreviated as CHAD,

542
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:39,410
so all cholinergic
neurons are

543
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:41,310
CHAD-positive,
and that is one

544
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:44,930
way of identifying
these cells.

545
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:48,350
Below is another
important enzyme,

546
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,970
acetylcholinesterase,
that stops

547
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:54,290
acetylcholin signaling
in the synapse by

548
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:56,910
degrading it to
acetate and choline.

549
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:59,270
Choline is then
taken up by

550
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:00,750
the presynaptic
terminal for

551
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:03,270
another
neurotransmitter cycle.

552
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:09,290
Here is a nice summary
of what I've just

553
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:12,230
said. Acetylcholine is
synthesized in the nerve

554
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:15,230
terminals by CHAT
from choline and

555
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:18,690
acetylcoenzyme A. It gets
packaged into vesicles,

556
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:25,390
released with oncoming
action potential, and

557
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:29,030
acts on receptors on
the postsynaptic cell.

558
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:32,070
Cholinergic signaling
in the brain is

559
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,890
important for learning
and memory, and these

560
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:37,430
CHAT-positive cells
are decreased in

561
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:40,010
brains from Alzheimer's
disease patients.

562
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:43,410
It is thought that
decreased cholinergic

563
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:45,310
signaling is
contributing to the

564
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:48,530
disease, so a treatment
approach is to

565
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:52,190
increase acetylcholine,
and there are

566
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:55,770
FDA-approved drugs
to do exactly that

567
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:59,370
by blocking acetylcholine
degradation.

568
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:04,930
Acetylcholinesterase
is the key

569
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:07,130
enzyme to stop
the cholinergic

570
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:09,070
signaling, as we
mentioned already.

571
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:12,270
It is expressed in
the synaptic cleft,

572
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:15,390
where it converts
acetylcholin into

573
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:18,070
acetate and choline.
This enzyme is

574
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:21,030
the target of some
Alzheimer's disease

575
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:24,510
drugs in an attempt
to balance out the

576
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:27,210
degeneration of
cholinergic neurons.

577
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:29,530
Acetylcholinesterase
is also

578
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:31,370
a target for
organophosphate

579
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:33,510
insecticides and
nerve agents.

580
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:37,150
Poisoning is causing
overstimulation

581
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:40,810
of the cholinergic
receptors and causing

582
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:43,070
muscle spasms and
other symptoms

583
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:45,890
resulting from hyperactive
parasympathetic

584
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:48,630
systems such as
increased salivation,

585
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:51,750
lacrimation, and
intestinal motility and

586
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:55,250
diarrhea. These
parasympathetic signals are

587
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:58,230
mediated by muscarinic
receptors and can be

588
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:01,650
controlled by muscarinic
antagonist atropine.

589
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:09,050
In the brain,
acetylcholine is not widely

590
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:12,470
produced like glutamate
and GABA. There are

591
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:15,150
three primary groups
of cholinergic neurons,

592
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:18,490
those originating in
ventral areas of the

593
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:21,430
forebrain, such as
nucleus basalis, a nuclei

594
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:24,510
of the diagonal band
and medial septum.

595
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:28,950
Another location is
in the pons, and there

596
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:31,550
are also small interneurals
in the striatum,

597
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,630
which are not shown
in this schematic.

598
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:37,790
These small cholinergic
neurons in the

599
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:40,910
striatum are inhibited
by dopaminergic neurons

600
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:46,210
from Substantia *****,
and they are the

601
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:49,010
basis for the use of
muscarinic receptor

602
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:52,470
antagonists in treating
Parkinson's disease.

603
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:56,910
Neurons from the
nucleus basalis project

604
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:59,870
to large areas of
the cerebral cortex,

605
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:03,510
while septal and
diagonal band neurons

606
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:06,450
project largely to
the hippocampus.

607
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:08,910
These path phases
are important

608
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:10,970
in learning
and memory, and

609
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,850
degenerate in
Alzheimer's disease.

610
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,570
Therefore,
treatment of this

611
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:17,590
disorder involves
the use of

612
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:19,890
acetylcholinester
as inhibitors

613
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:21,810
in attempts to alleviate

614
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:24,010
this cholinergic deficit.

615
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:28,390
Neurons originating in
the dorsal tegmentum

616
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:31,850
of the pons project
to the thalamus and

617
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:35,330
basal forebrain and
have descending pathways

618
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:38,870
to the reticular
formation, cerebellum,

619
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:41,210
vestibular nuclei, and
cranial nerve nuclei.

620
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:44,990
they are involved
in arousal and REM

621
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:50,090
sleep it's important
to know the locations

622
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:53,390
of these nuclei because
****** or injury

623
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:56,370
to these areas can
cause loss of functions

624
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:58,310
that are specific
for these pathways

625
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:02,870
so learning and memory
for basal forebrain

626
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:07,190
pathways and arousal
and sleep for

627
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:10,670
mesopotamia pathways
all the Neurocholinergic

628
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:13,470
neurons are found in
a few small areas in

629
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:16,490
the brain. They project
widely, and their

630
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:21,610
actions are mediated
by the receptors.

631
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:24,650
And the image shows
their distribution

632
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:27,050
in the brain. We
can see that cortex

633
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:29,370
expresses both
nicotinic and

634
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:31,670
muscarinic receptors,
while certain brain

635
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:33,910
areas have more
specific expression.

636
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:37,790
We can see that most
of the brainstem

637
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:40,230
has muscarinic
receptors, and there are

638
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:43,250
few small areas
expressing only nicotinic

639
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:45,430
receptors such as
substantia *****,

640
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:48,890
locus ferulis,
and septum. These

641
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:51,090
differences will cause
different actions

642
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:53,970
of acetylcholine
in these areas.

643
00:33:57,310 --> 00:34:00,770
Moving on to glatecholamine
neurotransmitters,

644
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:03,370
so dopamine,
noradrenaline or

645
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:07,270
norepinephrine and adrenaline
or epinephrine they

646
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:10,150
are produced in this
chain of chemical

647
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:12,850
reactions from
tyrosine all the way to

648
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:15,810
epinephrine it is
important to know this

649
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:19,330
biosynthesis pathway
because only cells that

650
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:22,290
produce catecholamines
express these keys

651
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:25,790
enzymes also this is
the basis for some

652
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:28,750
treatments such as l-dopa
is given to parkinson

653
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:31,950
disease patients
because it is dopamine

654
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:34,050
precursor and
increases the levels of

655
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:38,090
dopamine everywhere
and that relieves some

656
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:40,910
symptoms of this
neurodegenerative disease.

657
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:44,150
Equally important
is to know

658
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,830
the main degradation
pathways.

659
00:34:45,890 --> 00:34:48,550
It is important to know
that catecholamines

660
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:51,470
are degraded by the
same kind of enzymes,

661
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:54,510
so drugs targeting
these enzymes

662
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:57,590
such as monoamine
oxidase inhibitors

663
00:34:58,370 --> 00:35:03,290
for depression treatment
will affect the

664
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:09,530
levels of all of them
so monoamine oxidase

665
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:14,170
also degrades
serotomy and these can

666
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:16,730
lead to serious drug
interactions and we

667
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:18,970
will talk about it
later in this session

668
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:23,170
catecholamines are
released throughout

669
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:26,030
the brain but they
have very specific

670
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:28,800
areas where they
are produced within

671
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,860
the brain, just
like acetylcholine.

672
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,390
Catecholamines are
also produced by

673
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:37,070
other tissues outside
the brain as well.

674
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:38,410
In fact,

675
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:40,730
epinephrine is
produced by neurons of

676
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:43,950
the brainstem, but
mostly produced in the

677
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:47,470
adrenal glands and
serves as a hormone.

678
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:52,890
So, I already mentioned
that epaminergic

679
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:55,410
neurons project widely
in the brain. However,

680
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:58,350
their cell bodies
are primarily found

681
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:01,110
in three brain
locations, two in the

682
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:04,930
midbrain containing the
substantia ***** and

683
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:07,610
adjacent ventral
tegmental area and

684
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:10,950
the arcuate nucleus
of the hypothalamus.

685
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:15,290
Negrostriatal dopaminergic
neurons project

686
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:18,750
to striatum, so-called
nucleus and pitamen,

687
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:21,650
and are involved in
control of posture

688
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:24,810
and movement. These
neurons degenerate in

689
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:27,130
Parkinson's disease,
and drugs to treat

690
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:30,130
Parkinson stimulate
these pathways, such as

691
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:32,610
L-DOPA, increasing the
levels of dopamine.

692
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:38,210
The ventral tegmental
area neurons extend

693
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:40,830
to the cortex and
limbic system, and

694
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:43,310
they are referred
as mesocortical or

695
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:47,590
mesolimbic pathways,
respectively, and are

696
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:50,670
important for complex,
target-oriented

697
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:54,030
behaviors, including
psychotic behaviors.

698
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,930
So many antipsychotic
drugs work to

699
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:59,870
block or inhibit
these pathways. Those

700
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:01,830
neurons projecting
from the ventral

701
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:04,970
tegmental area to the
nucleus accumbens are

702
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:07,450
believed to be
involved in addiction.

703
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:11,770
Dopamine is also
synthesized by much shorter

704
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:14,950
neurons originating
in the arcuate nucleus

705
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:20,170
of the hypothalamus
and projecting to

706
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:25,050
pituitary into median
eminence and this pathway

707
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:29,530
is known as tubular
infidibular pathway.

708
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:33,670
These neurons regulate
anterior pituitary

709
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:36,530
function and decrease
prolactin secretion.

710
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:38,790
And some drugs
affecting dopamine

711
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:41,110
signaling also
perturb the system.

712
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:44,110
For example,
antipsychotics, particularly

713
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:45,650
the first
-generation ones,

714
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:49,550
often cause
hyperprolactinemia or

715
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:52,530
increase prolactin
levels in the blood.

716
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:55,830
The effects of
dopamine signaling

717
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:58,990
will depend again
on their receptors.

718
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:04,350
Here is the
map of dopamine

719
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:05,810
receptor distribution.

720
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:08,770
We can see that
dopaminergic neurons

721
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:11,970
also project widely
across the brain.

722
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:15,090
These receptors also have

723
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:17,070
specific patterns
of expression.

724
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:20,450
cortex and limbic
system have all kinds

725
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:23,970
of dopamine receptor
subtypes and these

726
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:26,390
are again controlling
addiction and

727
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:29,750
psychotic behaviors on
the other hand striatum

728
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:32,950
and hypothalamus have
a mix of specific

729
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:36,530
excitatory and
inhibitory receptors i

730
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:38,090
would like to turn
your attention to

731
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:41,670
striatum striatal
neurons are important for

732
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:45,490
coordinating movements
and i've already

733
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,650
mentioned how they are
involved in Parkinson's

734
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:52,750
disease affecting
cholinergic interneurons

735
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:56,770
in this area striatal
GABAergic neurons

736
00:38:56,770 --> 00:39:00,550
die in Huntington's
disease and we

737
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:05,890
already talked about this
as well the Huntington's

738
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:08,230
is a neurodegenerative
disease that

739
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:11,510
targets striatum
particularly medium spiny

740
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:15,430
neurons expressing
these two receptors in

741
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:18,950
the initial state of
the disease and this

742
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:23,150
results in the imbalance
of dopaminergic

743
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:26,770
signaling and causes
uncontrolled movements

744
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:30,970
of the arms legs head
face and upper body

745
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:34,250
which is a hallmark
of huntington disease.

746
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,490
We will switch
now to another

747
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:40,520
catecholamine, and
that is noradrenaline.

748
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:44,490
In the brain,

749
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:47,830
neurons synthesizing
neuroadrenaline

750
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:50,010
have their cell
bodies primarily

751
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:52,430
in the locus
ceruleus and lateral

752
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:54,790
tegmental region
in the bones.

753
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:57,730
The locus ceruleus
neurons project

754
00:39:57,730 --> 00:40:01,270
anteriorly to
large areas of the

755
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:04,530
cerebral cortex,
thalamus, hypothalamus,

756
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:08,310
and olfactory bulb,
with descending

757
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:10,890
projections to
the spinal cord.

758
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:13,590
The lateral tegmental
neurons have

759
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:15,550
ascending pathways
to the limbic system

760
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:17,870
and descending
projections to the

761
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:20,570
cerebellum and spinal
cord, with fibers

762
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:23,190
passing in the ventral
lateral column.

763
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:26,930
Noradrenergic pathways
involved in controlling

764
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:29,810
responses to
external sensory and

765
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:33,350
motor stimuli arousal
and attention and

766
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:35,890
learning and memory
and may be important in

767
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:39,350
major depression
midbrain neurons also

768
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:41,550
play important roles
in the control of

769
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:45,670
autonomic and neuroendocrine
functions magic

770
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:56,750
neurons just like
dopaminergic neurons

771
00:40:56,750 --> 00:41:00,090
have high metabolic
demands and produce a

772
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:03,010
lot of reactive oxygen
radicals which makes

773
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:05,150
them very susceptible
for degeneration

774
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:08,770
therefore it's not
surprising that Alzheimer's

775
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:10,930
and Parkinson's
disease patients also

776
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:13,870
have the generation
of noradrenaline

777
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:17,750
-producing neurons.
These neurons also die

778
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:21,450
from chronic alcohol
***** and their loss

779
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:23,870
contributes to Wernick
-Corsakov syndrome.

780
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:27,030
Noradrenaline is also
synthesized outside

781
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:29,510
central nervous system,
primarily in the

782
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:33,490
adrenal medulla and
sympathetic nerves.

783
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:40,850
Another neurotransmitter
of this group

784
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:43,930
is serotonin, or 5
-hydroxytryptamine,

785
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:46,830
and it's mostly
present outside the

786
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:49,710
brain, such as platelets
and gut epithelium.

787
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:52,630
In fact, intestinal
epithelial cells

788
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:56,590
produce about 90%
of body serotonin.

789
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:59,670
5-Hydroxytryptamine
is also

790
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:02,210
neuromodulator in
the brain and it's

791
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:04,770
been implicated
in sleep and mood

792
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:07,750
disorders, depression
and anxiety.

793
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:11,770
Again, I encourage you
to learn key enzymes

794
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:14,390
for synthesis of
serotonin from tryptophan.

795
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:17,150
These are specific
for serotonin orgic

796
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:20,930
cells and the key
degradation pathways.

797
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:25,530
These are important
targets for treatment

798
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:28,530
of mood disorders.
These drugs increase

799
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:30,730
the levels of serotonin
in the synaptic

800
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:32,810
cleft by two
different mechanisms,

801
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:35,410
blocking the reuptake
of serotonin through

802
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:38,170
serotonin transporters
or by inhibiting

803
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:41,170
serotonin degradation.
Remember that

804
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:43,950
monoamine oxidase
inhibitors also increase

805
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:45,870
levels of
catecholamines, including

806
00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:49,110
dopamine, norepinephrine,
and epinephrine.

807
00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:52,430
Another key information
is that these

808
00:42:52,430 --> 00:42:55,710
two classes of drugs
should never be

809
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:58,650
taken at the same time
or closed in time.

810
00:42:58,650 --> 00:43:02,550
Since they act through
different mechanisms,

811
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:05,090
they can increase
serotonin to dangerous

812
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:08,150
levels and lead to
serotonin syndrome.

813
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:11,790
again this is caused
by medications that

814
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:14,230
build up high levels
of serotonin in the

815
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:17,370
body and too much
serotonin causes signs

816
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:19,750
and symptoms that can
range from shivering

817
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:22,870
and diarrhea to
muscle rigidity fever

818
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:26,050
and seizures and
serotonin syndrome

819
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:30,130
can cause that if not
treated so this is

820
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:32,470
a serious condition
and that is why it's

821
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:37,200
important not to
mix SSRIs with MAO

822
00:43:37,810 --> 00:43:42,410
inhibitors and one
should be cautious when

823
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:45,710
switching between
these classes of drugs.

824
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:51,950
In the brain serotonin
is produced in

825
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:55,410
two small areas raffin
nuclei. Rosterone

826
00:43:55,410 --> 00:43:57,870
nuclei projects widely
to the brain and

827
00:43:57,870 --> 00:44:00,130
caudal has projections
to the spinal

828
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:03,870
cord these pathways
have broad influences

829
00:44:03,870 --> 00:44:06,310
throughout the brain
and are important

830
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:09,290
for sensory processing
and homeostasis

831
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:12,350
they play a role in
psychotic behaviors

832
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:15,330
depression and obsessive
compulsive disorder

833
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:19,330
and eating behavior
and a major targets

834
00:44:19,330 --> 00:44:22,370
for drugs used to
treat these diseases

835
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:30,770
Histamine is the last
neurotransmitter in

836
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:32,410
this group that we're
going to talk about

837
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:35,210
and is present in
large amounts in other

838
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:38,910
tissues such as skin
and lung but also

839
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:40,910
serves as neurotransmitter
in the brain.

840
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:44,210
Histaminergic neurons
primarily reside

841
00:44:44,210 --> 00:44:47,110
in the posterior
hypothalamus

842
00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:51,530
referred to as
tuberomammillary nucleus.

843
00:44:51,970 --> 00:44:56,210
These neurons form long
ascending connections

844
00:44:56,210 --> 00:44:59,810
to many telencephalic
areas, including

845
00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:02,010
all areas of the
cerebral cortex, the

846
00:45:02,010 --> 00:45:04,870
limbic system, basal
ganglia, and others.

847
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:07,850
Also, long-descending
neurons project

848
00:45:07,850 --> 00:45:10,470
to mesencephalic and
brainstem structures,

849
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:12,470
including cranial
nerve nuclei,

850
00:45:12,770 --> 00:45:15,270
substantia *****,
locus coeruleus,

851
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:17,770
mesopotamia tegumetum,
dorsal raphe,

852
00:45:18,110 --> 00:45:20,130
cerebellum, and
spinal cord.

853
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:23,230
Hystaminergic
neurons play a major

854
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:26,630
role in arousal,
sleep-wake cycle,

855
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:29,150
in coupling
neuronal activity

856
00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:31,490
with cerebral
metabolism, and

857
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:33,710
in neuroendocrine
regulation.

858
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:40,190
I would like to
show you this table

859
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:43,490
summarizing the key small
molecule transmitters

860
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:45,810
that we just talked
about, their site of

861
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:48,670
production, and
projections in the brain,

862
00:45:48,670 --> 00:45:51,430
their functions and
associated disorders.

863
00:45:51,690 --> 00:45:54,730
For instance, nigrostriatal
pathway consists

864
00:45:54,730 --> 00:45:57,190
of dopaminergic
neurons residing in the

865
00:45:57,190 --> 00:46:02,690
substantia ***** and
projecting to striatum.

866
00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:05,910
Their major function
is control of

867
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:08,370
posture and movement,
and these neurons

868
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:10,390
degenerate in
Parkinson's disease.

869
00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:13,890
Please use this table
in concert with cartoons

870
00:46:13,890 --> 00:46:16,950
to learn where these
important clusters

871
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:21,250
of different neurons
are and to help you

872
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:23,370
organize your knowledge
about their locations

873
00:46:23,370 --> 00:46:26,610
and their functions
this is essential

874
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:30,590
to understand because
to understand disorders

875
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:33,530
when these specific
areas of the brain

876
00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:37,850
damaged whether it's the
degeneration or injury

877
00:46:37,850 --> 00:46:41,270
or ****** now we will
talk briefly about

878
00:46:41,270 --> 00:46:44,210
some other classes
of neurotransmitters.

879
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,370
ATP is an essential
molecule to store

880
00:46:48,370 --> 00:46:51,130
energy but also
serves as a

881
00:46:51,130 --> 00:46:54,410
neurotransmitter and
a danger signal that

882
00:46:54,410 --> 00:46:56,370
can trigger
inflammatory response.

883
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:01,050
ATP and its metabolites
act on a system of

884
00:47:01,050 --> 00:47:05,410
purinergic receptors
composed of P2X ionotropic

885
00:47:05,410 --> 00:47:10,250
receptors and p2y
and p1 metabotropic

886
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:15,450
receptors so atp can act
as a fast neurotransmitter

887
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:18,250
and also together
with its metabolites

888
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:23,030
as a neuromodulator
these purines can be

889
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:26,950
released by both neurons
and astrocytes to drive

890
00:47:26,950 --> 00:47:30,170
the pressure to sleep
and the main effect

891
00:47:30,170 --> 00:47:33,650
of caffeine for
promoting wakefulness is

892
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:38,150
through inhibiting denosin
P1-class receptors.

893
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:43,130
Moving on to a
very different type

894
00:47:43,130 --> 00:47:45,790
of neurotransmitter,
one that is

895
00:47:45,790 --> 00:47:48,310
actually a gas, and
we already talked

896
00:47:48,310 --> 00:47:50,750
about it earlier
in the session.

897
00:47:51,370 --> 00:47:53,950
So, all of the
neurotransmitters that

898
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:56,630
we talked about
signal enter

899
00:47:56,630 --> 00:47:59,710
greatly, And now we
are talking about a

900
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,570
neurotransmitter
that can also serve

901
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:04,350
as a retrograde
neurotransmitter.

902
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:08,670
Nitric oxide is
produced by nitric oxide

903
00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:14,210
synthase, and it then
just diffuses in all

904
00:48:14,210 --> 00:48:18,830
directions, including
from postsynaptic to

905
00:48:18,830 --> 00:48:21,370
presynaptic terminal,
where it can modulate

906
00:48:21,370 --> 00:48:23,850
the release of other
neurotransmitters, such

907
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:27,870
as glutamate. It also
diffuses to other

908
00:48:27,870 --> 00:48:31,330
surrounding cells,
neurons and glia cells.

909
00:48:32,270 --> 00:48:35,170
Nitric oxide can have
other physiological

910
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:38,590
effects, such as
relaxation of the smooth

911
00:48:38,590 --> 00:48:41,610
musculature of intestines
and blood vessels.

912
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:47,140
Nitric oxide also
serves as a vasotilator.

913
00:48:49,870 --> 00:48:52,950
Peptide neuron
transmitters are

914
00:48:52,950 --> 00:48:55,310
chains of amino
acids that have

915
00:48:55,310 --> 00:48:57,570
various effects
throughout the brain,

916
00:48:57,570 --> 00:49:00,090
brain stem and
the spinal cord.

917
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:04,050
There are many, many
neuropeptides, and

918
00:49:04,050 --> 00:49:06,570
here I mention only
a handful of them.

919
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,810
I would like you to
learn the members of

920
00:49:09,810 --> 00:49:11,910
the opioid family
and their primary

921
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:15,630
receptors. They are
important mediators of the

922
00:49:15,630 --> 00:49:19,590
pain pathways, and
the receptors are

923
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:22,690
targets of drugs that
are used to treat

924
00:49:22,690 --> 00:49:26,230
chronic pain, as well
as recreational drugs.

925
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:28,470
Therefore, it
is important to

926
00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:30,110
be familiar with
this system.

927
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:33,490
Please keep in mind
that neuropeptides

928
00:49:33,490 --> 00:49:35,270
are usually derived
from precursor

929
00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:37,590
proteins, so know
these precursor

930
00:49:37,590 --> 00:49:39,750
proteins for these
key neuropeptides.

931
00:49:40,230 --> 00:49:43,090
The second group
in this table lists

932
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:45,770
some hypothalamic
peptides, and we

933
00:49:45,770 --> 00:49:48,050
will talk more about
their actions in a

934
00:49:48,050 --> 00:49:50,690
separate session
about hypothalamus.

935
00:49:51,670 --> 00:49:54,490
The last group
illustrates that many

936
00:49:54,490 --> 00:49:57,870
neuropeptides that were
originally discovered as

937
00:49:57,870 --> 00:50:00,610
hormones of the
gastrointestinal system are

938
00:50:00,610 --> 00:50:03,270
also produced in the
brain where they have

939
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:06,390
many important modulatory
reactions on behaviors

940
00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:10,530
such as feeding, blood
flow, pain, hormone

941
00:50:10,530 --> 00:50:13,690
release and other
homeostatic functions.

942
00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:19,470
So, in summary for
this session, there

943
00:50:19,470 --> 00:50:21,630
are three main
concepts to learn.

944
00:50:21,970 --> 00:50:23,090
First,

945
00:50:23,450 --> 00:50:25,370
cells are
compartmentalizing

946
00:50:25,370 --> 00:50:28,690
chemicals. They
process, store, and

947
00:50:28,690 --> 00:50:30,430
then release them
for signaling.

948
00:50:31,330 --> 00:50:33,770
The cell body
and release sites

949
00:50:33,770 --> 00:50:35,770
can also be
very different.

950
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:39,490
Cells can be distributed
throughout the

951
00:50:39,490 --> 00:50:41,930
brain and they
can also release

952
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:44,670
neurotransmitters throughout
the brain as well.

953
00:50:45,590 --> 00:50:48,750
Or neuronal cell bodies
can be clustered in

954
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:51,410
nuclei where they produce
the neurotransmitters,

955
00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:55,650
but then their
action can be either

956
00:50:55,650 --> 00:51:00,570
diffused throughout the
brain or be specifically

957
00:51:00,570 --> 00:51:05,770
targeted to certain
centers in the brain.

958
00:51:06,970 --> 00:51:09,090
Neurotransmitter
receptors are the

959
00:51:09,090 --> 00:51:12,170
main source of the
downstream effects,

960
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:13,950
and they are
really the control

961
00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:16,730
point on how the
neurotransmitter

962
00:51:16,730 --> 00:51:18,550
will change the
brain activity.

963
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:21,390
And lastly, I would
like you to know

964
00:51:21,390 --> 00:51:23,030
the sites of
production and the

965
00:51:23,030 --> 00:51:25,270
effects of the
neurotransmitters that we

966
00:51:25,270 --> 00:51:27,770
talked about and
are listed below.

967
00:51:29,150 --> 00:51:31,430
Please leave any
feedback on this

968
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:33,670
lecture at the
link listed here.

969
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:35,190
And thank you
for listening

970
00:51:35,190 --> 00:51:36,550
and your attention.
