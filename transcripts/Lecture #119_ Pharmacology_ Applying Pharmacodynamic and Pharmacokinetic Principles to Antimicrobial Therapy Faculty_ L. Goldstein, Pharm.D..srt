1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:03,610
Welcome, students, to our

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:06,750
series on
antimicrobial therapy,

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:08,730
the pharmacology.

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:11,250
Dr. Goldstein speaking.

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,990
We will begin with applying
our pharmacodynamics

6
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:17,650
and pharmacokinetics
principles to

7
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:20,630
antimicrobial therapy.
So this is your

8
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:24,950
opportunity to take the
general principles that

9
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:26,870
we learned in the
previous series of

10
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:31,210
lectures and apply them
to a class of drugs.

11
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:36,830
Please contact
me if you'd like

12
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:39,130
to have a chat
about pharmacology.

13
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,750
Individuals and groups
are most welcome.

14
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:48,370
Here are the
learning objectives.

15
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,710
I am going to go
over these. I want

16
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:54,330
to make a point
of them. The first

17
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:56,730
point I wish to make
is that these do

18
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,590
not stand alone.
They are integrated.

19
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:00,870
So

20
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:06,710
please try and
conceptualize things, all

21
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:08,410
of these principles
that we'll be

22
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:12,130
talking about in the
context of the whole.

23
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,330
So we're going
to talk general

24
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:18,930
principles about the
antimicrobial drugs.

25
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:22,430
Mechanisms, mechanisms,
mechanisms. In

26
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:25,180
the case of
antimicrobials, mechanisms

27
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:28,310
of resistance are
equally important

28
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:31,470
to the mechanisms
of action, and the

29
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:34,750
mechanisms are
related to each other.

30
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,250
Microbicidal and
microbistatic effects,

31
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:44,010
these are pharmacodynamic
principles.

32
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:45,290
Effect,

33
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:49,470
drug concentration,
and effect.

34
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:54,350
And since we're talking
about microbes that

35
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:57,630
we would like to
eliminate to kill, we're

36
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:01,550
talking about inhibitory
effects of the drug.

37
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:06,890
And as with all
drugs, we're talking

38
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:09,370
going to be talking
about effectiveness.

39
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:18,930
I invite you to draw
various graphs that are

40
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:23,830
models of these behaviors
of the drugs. We

41
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:27,950
will combine our
pharmacokinetic and

42
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:32,430
pharmacodynamics concepts,
and this is called the

43
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:37,350
PK-PD profiles of the
various antimicrobials.

44
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:41,730
We will be talking
about the area under the

45
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:48,170
concentration curve
to minimum inhibitory

46
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:53,630
concentration.
I'll go into

47
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,650
that in more
detail, certainly.

48
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:00,340
And factors in
clinical selection of

49
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:03,050
antimicrobial agents.
I'm not asking

50
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:06,370
you to be a clinician
at this point.

51
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:08,650
These are basic

52
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,330
pharmacologic principles

53
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:13,590
for treating patients. I

54
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,390
suggest that you use

55
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:22,150
whatever resources
you like.

56
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,710
You can use my
word handout.

57
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,630
You can use my
video lecture,

58
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,490
guided reading questions

59
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,570
if you want to or not.

60
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:36,450
I do require the practice
questions because

61
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,530
this helps you to apply
your knowledge, helps

62
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,870
you to check your
knowledge, helps you to

63
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:46,830
think through
pharmacology, and it's

64
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:51,950
representative of the
questions I ask on the exam.

65
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,290
Here are some
links to help

66
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:58,850
you if you wish
to use them.

67
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,050
And the list of what you

68
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,530
need to know
and understand.

69
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:09,870
These are terms,
the language of

70
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:12,230
pharmacology, the
language of medicine.

71
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:16,450
I do have the
definitions in the notes

72
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:19,270
handout, but you can
get them anywhere. So

73
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:25,610
let's begin
with mechanisms

74
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:27,810
of antimicrobial action.

75
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:30,270
Mechanisms,
mechanisms, mechanisms.

76
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:36,170
Drug targets, so what
is it the drug is

77
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:38,830
going to be binding to
to produce its effect?

78
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:43,090
Microbial molecules
that are essential

79
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:46,230
components of
biochemical reactions in

80
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:50,800
the microbes. If we
interrupt essential

81
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:53,930
pathways, that's
going to kill the

82
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:56,950
microbe, or at least
suppress its growth.

83
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:01,250
The effect,
interference with these

84
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,060
physiologic
pathways kills the

85
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,590
microorganisms or
slows their growth.

86
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:09,650
So if we have a
drug that's going

87
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:12,930
to slow growth
but not kill, and

88
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:15,470
many of our
antibiotics do this,

89
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:19,510
what happens is we
allow the host immune

90
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:23,930
system to eradicate the
microbes and this is

91
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:27,080
just fine drugs that
are bacteriostatic,

92
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,530
fungistatic are still going
to be effective because

93
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,810
we're relying on our
host immune system.

94
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:38,870
Selective
toxicity so this

95
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,950
is the safety
of the drugs

96
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,550
to the human.

97
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:47,110
Humans in our
case, animals

98
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,740
in the case of
veterinarians.

99
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:53,330
Selective toxicity.
So toxicity to

100
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:55,690
the microbe, safe
for the human.

101
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:00,330
The extent to which
an antimicrobial

102
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:03,670
agent harms microbial
cells but does

103
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:07,330
not damage host
cells at therapeutic

104
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:11,090
concentrations. This
is what determines

105
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:14,670
the relative safety
of the drugs.

106
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:18,610
Actually it's a
term that can be

107
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:21,470
applied to any
pharmacologic therapy.

108
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:27,150
Mechanisms of
antimicrobial action.

109
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:36,230
I've indicated here
the takeaways. This is

110
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,310
what you need to
remember from this slide.

111
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:43,110
Inhibition of biologic
targets, actively

112
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:46,610
and rapidly growing
organisms are more

113
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:48,930
susceptible to drug
action than those

114
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:52,590
in the resting phase
because the drugs

115
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:58,310
target biologic
molecules in various

116
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:02,550
pathways or cell
walls or something the

117
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:06,910
organism needs in
order to survive. So if

118
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:09,830
the organisms are
growing, they are

119
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:13,290
synthesizing within
these various pathways.

120
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:15,490
So this is why
the actively and

121
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:17,630
rapidly growing
organisms are more

122
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:21,790
susceptible to drug
action than the

123
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:23,810
organisms when
they are resting.

124
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:30,070
we will be talking
about bacteria and

125
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:33,210
fungi and viruses
and protozoan helmets

126
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:37,830
over the course of
this year you do not

127
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:40,630
need to memorize these
at this moment we

128
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:44,680
will soon be getting
to the various drugs

129
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,770
for the treatment
of bacteria and the

130
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:50,190
others we will get
to at a later point

131
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:58,150
so cell wall synthesis
bacteria fungi fungi

132
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:01,870
need that cell wall
if they don't have the

133
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,510
cell wall they're not
protected from the

134
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:06,490
environment cell membrane
function we all need

135
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:10,730
cell membrane function
protein synthesis

136
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:13,670
folate synthesis
nucleic acid metabolism

137
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:19,350
various important pathways
that all organisms

138
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:27,740
need and nucleic acid
DNA and RNA targets.

139
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:33,010
Viruses are actually
packages of genome.

140
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:35,630
It's a genome and an
envelope basically.

141
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:42,410
So the approach is
against various viral

142
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:48,070
targets. Protozoids are
also one-celled. The

143
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:52,750
idea is pretty much the
same. And worms, these

144
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,910
are multicellular. So
there are a number of

145
00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:02,170
biologic and physiologic
targets for them.

146
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,450
What's the takeaway?

147
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:08,450
Inhibition of
biologic targets.

148
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:11,230
Actively and rapidly
growing organisms

149
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:13,310
are more susceptible
to the drug action

150
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:15,030
than those in the
resting phase.

151
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:19,210
This is an
illustration that will

152
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:22,430
hopefully help you
visualize various

153
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:24,210
targets. You don't
need to memorize

154
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:26,930
this, but it might
be helpful if you

155
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:30,970
draw your own figures
and label them.

156
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:34,650
The drug names
here, we will

157
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,950
eventually get
to all of them.

158
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:40,650
and the antibiotics,
the antibacterial

159
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:44,030
drugs, we will be
seeing very soon.

160
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:54,840
The antimicrobials are
categorized, one, by

161
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:58,700
what type of microbe,
two, by mechanisms

162
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,740
of action, and three, by
spectrums of activity.

163
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,820
So some antimicrobials
are effective

164
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:09,700
against a few, relative
few, number of organisms,

165
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:14,640
while others are
effective against a

166
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,060
lot of different
species of organisms. So

167
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:23,680
narrow spectrum, a few.
Broad spectrum, many.

168
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,100
Why do we care? However,

169
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,020
we need to use
the most selective

170
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,860
drug that produces
the fewest

171
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:36,720
adverse effects.
So the most active,

172
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:42,280
selective, safe
drugs that the

173
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,440
organisms are
susceptible to.

174
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:49,740
That said, there
is a great problem

175
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:53,680
with resistance
among especially

176
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,240
the bacteria
and the viruses.

177
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,660
This is a figure to
help you visualize

178
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,160
what we're
talking about with

179
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,820
spectrums of activity.
You don't need

180
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,180
to memorize this
at this moment.

181
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:11,980
You will, I think,
at some point find

182
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:15,200
understanding of
narrow spectrum

183
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,640
versus broad spectrum
versus in-between

184
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,520
spectrum to be very
helpful to you.

185
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,360
Take, for example,

186
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,320
doxycycline here.

187
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,800
It is effective, at
least theoretically,

188
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:35,040
against a large
number of organisms.

189
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,900
And it's even going
off the side here

190
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,540
because it's
effective against a

191
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:43,780
certain protozoa as
well as bacteria.

192
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:49,720
So we always start by
saying susceptible.

193
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,760
Susceptible organisms.

194
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:58,940
Isoniazid, you
can see, is

195
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,720
a really narrow spectrum.

196
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,070
It's one organism.

197
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,420
Penicillin here is pretty

198
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:12,460
narrow spectrum,
et cetera.

199
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,780
Let's talk about
resistance.

200
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,740
This is really
important to know.

201
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:27,250
I'm going to
write on here, no.

202
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:34,610
So the mechanism. Well,

203
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:38,730
bacteria,
especially viruses,

204
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:44,370
especially the fungi
to some extent,

205
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:49,530
random events
cause alterations

206
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:52,070
of the genetic
information in

207
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,990
the microbe. This
is just normal.

208
00:12:54,990 --> 00:13:00,090
When a drug happens
to be present and the

209
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:04,130
mutations happen to confer
a survival advantage

210
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:08,410
to the microorganism,
this is just the

211
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:12,150
process of natural
selection. It's normal.

212
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:20,330
random events survival
advantage natural

213
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:23,930
selection now
sometimes random events

214
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:26,750
in the presence of a
drug do not provide

215
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:29,350
survival advantage
but it is those

216
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:32,450
organisms that can
survive in the presence

217
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:38,130
of drug that would
organisms that

218
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:40,770
would normally be
susceptible to the drug.

219
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:43,650
These have now
developed resistance.

220
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:50,010
Through selection
pressure.

221
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:52,310
The mutations are not

222
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:55,270
caused by the
drug per se,

223
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:59,830
but with increased
exposure to the drug,

224
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:04,470
this increases the
potential for the organism

225
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:11,210
to develop mutations
that confer its

226
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:14,870
survival advantage in
the presence of the drug.

227
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:17,410
Confer resistance.

228
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,430
So evolution,

229
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:23,590
natural selection, and
selection pressure.

230
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:26,770
This is an important
concept to understand

231
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:29,210
when we're talking
about resistance,

232
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:31,830
not only to
microbes, but also

233
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:35,170
to cancers. So,
going back to

234
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:37,590
microbes, how
does this happen?

235
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:38,670
Well,

236
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:43,130
billions of people
take antibiotics.

237
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:46,190
Antibiotics
are not always

238
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:48,110
prescribed properly.

239
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:52,730
Long duration of
antibiotics provides

240
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:56,610
a long-term selection
pressure for these

241
00:14:56,610 --> 00:15:00,310
microbes to develop
resistance. Let

242
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:04,310
us not forget
environmental practices.

243
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:07,410
Use of antibiotics
in animal

244
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:11,030
feed, not to treat
disease of the

245
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:13,650
animal, but to
make them fatter.

246
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:18,130
This is key.
You must know.

247
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,210
Frequent or long
-term use of a

248
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:23,290
particular drug
increases the risk of

249
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:25,230
microbial mutations
and produces

250
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:27,970
resistance to the
drug. I said it before,

251
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:30,230
you'll hear me
say it many times.

252
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:39,150
So we have intrinsic
resistance and acquired

253
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:43,490
resistance. Intrinsic
simply means that a

254
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:50,110
microorganism that is
exposed to an antimicrobial

255
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:53,630
drug for the first
time is just naturally

256
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:58,090
resistant. It has
mechanisms in place

257
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:03,850
already that prevent
the drug from getting to

258
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:07,690
its side of action or
producing its effect.

259
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:11,130
Acquired resistance.
This is what

260
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:14,030
we are so fearful
of in this world.

261
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:17,610
This is what we were
talking about with

262
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:20,270
selection pressure.
Selection pressure

263
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:29,910
leads to acquired
resistance.

264
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:33,470
Normally responsive
organisms acquire

265
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:36,130
spontaneous
random chromosomal

266
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:40,110
mutations, or they
can actually transfer

267
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:43,450
resistance genes
to each other.

268
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:47,210
So that an organism
that may not have

269
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:52,570
developed its own
resistance mechanisms

270
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:55,930
to a particular drug
have now acquired

271
00:16:55,930 --> 00:17:00,690
them from another bug.
This is especially

272
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:07,150
true with bacteria,
and bacteria

273
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:11,950
cause annoying
diseases, but they can

274
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:15,370
cause life-threatening,
deadly diseases.

275
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,250
Acquired resistance,
well, both, intrinsic

276
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,250
resistance and acquired
resistance, the

277
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:28,750
four main mechanisms
are either the drug

278
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:32,570
doesn't reach its
target because it's

279
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:36,030
pumped out once it
enters the microbe, or

280
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:39,010
it just can't get in
in the first place.

281
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:42,870
The gram-negative
bacteria, which

282
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:45,270
we'll talk about in
the next lecture,

283
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:49,670
are structured in such
a way that they have

284
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:53,210
a membrane that
surrounds them. And they

285
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:56,710
get their nutrients,
etc., through something

286
00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:00,230
called porins. These
are protein channels.

287
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:03,950
Well, drugs can get
to these gram-negative

288
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:08,430
bacteria target sites
through the porins.

289
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:11,290
So if the bacteria
are able to alter the

290
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:14,150
porins in such a way
that the drug can't

291
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:16,070
get through, but they
can still get their

292
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:19,190
nutrients, then we
now have resistance

293
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:21,490
by that mechanism.
So the drug does not

294
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:23,950
reach its target by
these two mechanisms.

295
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,520
The drug can
be inactivated.

296
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:30,930
The microbe can
develop enzymes that

297
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:33,430
will, in fact,
inactivate the drug.

298
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:38,170
The microbe can
alter the drug target

299
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:41,230
in such a way
that the target no

300
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:43,410
longer has affinity
for the drug. The

301
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:45,550
drug won't bind,
and if it doesn't

302
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:47,590
bind, it won't
produce its effect.

303
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:51,950
Yet, that target is still
capable of producing

304
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:55,670
the metabolic function
of the organism,

305
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:59,550
and therefore the
organism continues to

306
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:02,650
survive and is resistant
by that mechanisms.

307
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:07,130
or organisms express
alternative metabolic

308
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:10,930
pathways. This is not
common, but it exists.

309
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:13,410
For example,

310
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:17,550
some bacteria,
many bacteria,

311
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:21,710
synthesize their own
folic acid. We humans

312
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:23,990
do not do that. We
get it from our diet.

313
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:28,690
Now, if the pathway
for manufacturing

314
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:32,610
folic acid, for a drug
that inhibits this

315
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:36,810
pathway is altered
such that now the drug

316
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:38,650
doesn't have any
effect on the pathway

317
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:42,250
because the organism
developed a different

318
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,930
pathway. That
organism will continue

319
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:47,710
to survive in the
presence of the drug.

320
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:55,250
this is just an
illustration to help you

321
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:59,610
visualize the some
of these mechanisms

322
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:01,750
that I mentioned the
exclusion barrier

323
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:06,330
here's an efflux pump
the altered target

324
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:10,770
an example is
protein synthesis

325
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:15,890
right here and
enzymatic inactivation

326
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:19,730
that's indicated
in the figure here.

327
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,620
Okay so how do
we know what drug

328
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:31,400
we should use
against what bug?

329
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,000
Minimum inhibitory
concentration is frequently

330
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,160
used to determine
the susceptibility

331
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,540
of bacteria

332
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,600
to a particular
antibiotic.

333
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:50,020
Minimum inhibitory
concentration. I'll show

334
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,400
you a figure of that
in the next slide.

335
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,440
There is also
something called

336
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,360
minimum bactericidal
concentration.

337
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:00,580
We don't usually
use the MBC,

338
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,900
as you will
see coming up.

339
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:07,740
For drugs that
kill organisms, The

340
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,660
minimum bactericidal
concentration

341
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,040
is pretty much
the same as the

342
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,820
minimum inhibitory
concentration.

343
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:20,060
Susceptibility
testing is most

344
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:22,700
commonly used to
determine the likelihood,

345
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:25,500
because this
is a lab value,

346
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,640
that a particular
antibiotic, or can be

347
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,040
also used for antifungals,
will be effective

348
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:35,500
in stopping the
growth of the bacteria

349
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,460
or ****** causing
the infection. So

350
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:43,700
susceptibility testing
determines probability.

351
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,980
This is a
laboratory value,

352
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,660
but it's very helpful.

353
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,260
On the left-hand
side, this is an

354
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,560
example of a Brass
dilution test.

355
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:03,700
These three tubes have
bacterial growth in

356
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,870
here. You can see that
it's kind of turbid.

357
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,860
At this point
right here, this

358
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,400
is called the
break point,

359
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,400
the concentration of
drug has been increased

360
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,480
to the point where
it is now clear

361
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,180
broth, indicating the
bacteria are killed.

362
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:28,120
So the minimum
inhibitory concentration,

363
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,700
the first tube in which
we see the concentration

364
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,960
that produces this
killing effect,

365
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,340
in this example
here, is 2

366
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:38,060
micrograms per
milliliter.

367
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,200
Minimum inhibitory
concentration,

368
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,680
we will be utilizing
that to help

369
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,920
us determine
efficacy of drugs.

370
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:51,420
This is a couple
of diffusion

371
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,560
tests. The concept
is the same.

372
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,300
So, let's talk about
pharmacodynamics and

373
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:01,620
pharmacokinetics of
antimicrobial therapy.

374
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:10,800
Drugs that kill
microorganisms are sidal,

375
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:14,000
microbicidal,
bactericidal, fungicidal,

376
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,200
etc. etc.

377
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,320
Drugs that slow
the growth and

378
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,100
replication,
but do not kill

379
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,390
a microbe, are
called static,

380
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,600
microbistatic,
bacteriostatic,

381
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:35,980
fungistatic, which is
fine for patients who

382
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:39,840
have a healthy active
immune system once

383
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:44,160
we slow that gross
see the plateau here

384
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,660
then the immune system
will do the job of

385
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:54,340
eradication this is
microbial gross up up up

386
00:23:54,340 --> 00:24:00,700
up up drug is added
at this point and for

387
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:03,560
bacteriostatic drugs
we get that plateau.

388
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:07,620
For bactericidal drugs,

389
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:12,640
yeah, we see
growth reduced

390
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,740
to basically nothing.

391
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,260
Which is better? Well,
shouldn't we always

392
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:23,020
use a bactericidal
drug? Not necessarily.

393
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:25,920
We have to use the
drug that's going to

394
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:29,540
actually be effective
against the organism. I

395
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,160
know you're familiar with

396
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,520
these dose
-response curves.

397
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,840
We're going to be using
them to demonstrate

398
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:48,300
the effective
resistance on the half

399
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,740
-maximal inhibitory
concentration, so

400
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:55,380
that's IC50, which
is analogous to EC50.

401
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:58,760
We talked about EC50
in terms of agonists

402
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:03,220
producing an effect,
and it was measured

403
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:06,660
by the EC50, the
half-maximal effect.

404
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:09,460
Well, it's the
inhibitory effect that

405
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,420
we're looking for
with these drugs,

406
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:14,940
so we call it
the half-maximal

407
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:17,280
inhibitory concentration.
That's all.

408
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,820
response, concentration,

409
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,540
dose-response curve.

410
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:29,660
For bugs with
intermediate

411
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:33,220
resistance, that
simply means it takes

412
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:37,220
more drug to
produce the effect,

413
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:39,660
the maximal effect
up here, which is

414
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:43,400
the maximal kill
effect, let's say.

415
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:47,980
the originally the
organism was susceptible

416
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:52,960
to this concentration
EC50 at this

417
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,560
concentration and it
started to develop

418
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,140
resistance to the
point where all

419
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:02,400
right took a little
more drug so the I

420
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:07,460
should say IC50 not
EC50 occurs at this

421
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:10,260
concentration see
the difference here

422
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:13,510
but we still get
the maximal effect

423
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:17,040
and in this figure
the organism still

424
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,620
has a little more
resistance takes a

425
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:22,940
little more drug to
produce the effect

426
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:27,120
but it's still working
okay well great

427
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,980
intermediate resistance
increase ic50

428
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,260
you can see it's
shifting to the

429
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:35,720
right higher
concentrations needed

430
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,900
to achieve a
particular effect which

431
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,920
is a decrease in
microbial burden.

432
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,380
But if we're going
to be increasing

433
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:50,260
the dose, we have
to think about is it

434
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:52,260
going to be tolerable
to the patient?

435
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:56,300
Is the toxicity of
the drug going to be

436
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:59,060
such that it's going
to harm the patient?

437
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:02,020
If so, even though
the organism has

438
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:05,680
so-called intermediate
it resistance, we

439
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:08,280
can't achieve a
high enough dose to

440
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:11,420
eradicate the organism
or slow its growth.

441
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:15,380
So let's take a
look at the lower

442
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:18,840
figure that's
representing resistance.

443
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,260
This would be
the original

444
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:26,580
susceptibility
curve. The organism

445
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,440
is completely
susceptible.

446
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:34,660
But over time, it has
produced resistance

447
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:40,000
mechanisms such
that the Emax

448
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,460
can never be achieved.
We can get some

449
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:46,260
effect, but it may
not be adequate.

450
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:51,940
When the organism
is resistant,

451
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:54,160
because this is
what we want, we

452
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,320
don't want any
organisms hanging out

453
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,840
in here that
haven't been killed,

454
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,000
the organism is
considered to be resistant

455
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,360
to the drug. Please
understand these

456
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:13,000
basic concepts. This
is a no slide. No.

457
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,120
Know this.

458
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:16,000
Take out your pen.

459
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,800
Take out a
piece of paper.

460
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:21,720
Let your hand
send messages up

461
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,180
to your brain
so that you can

462
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:28,280
truly understand
this concept.

463
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,460
All right,
let's integrate

464
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:36,940
pharmacokinetics and
pharmacodynamics now.

465
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,960
All of these antibiotics,
antimicrobials,

466
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,140
have something
called PK-PD

467
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:50,740
profiles as predictors
of efficacy.

468
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:57,860
I mentioned before
that culture

469
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:59,600
and sensitivity,
I should say,

470
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:08,260
determining the minimum
effective concentration

471
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:13,220
is a predictor, and
now the PKPD profiles

472
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:17,280
are predictors of
efficacy. Rational

473
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:21,340
dosing of antimicrobial
therapy depends on

474
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:28,300
the relationship between
the pharmacokinetic

475
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:31,000
properties, so we're
thinking about ADMI,

476
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,020
administration and

477
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:35,980
absorption, distribution,

478
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:42,660
which are dose and
plasma concentration.

479
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:46,020
And remember, dose and
plasma concentration

480
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:50,060
relate to the drug
concentration at the

481
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:53,660
site of action, which
relates to the effect.

482
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:58,040
We must also consider
the elimination,

483
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:02,980
metabolism and excretion,
because that also

484
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:06,280
will affect the
plasma concentration.

485
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:13,420
And all of these
features are going to

486
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:20,920
relate to the duration
of drug action.

487
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,600
Pharmacokinetics and
pharmacodynamics.

488
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,660
Another curve.

489
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:35,640
Drug goes in here.

490
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,860
Obviously, this
is intravenous.

491
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,260
It achieves some sort
of peak concentration,

492
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:47,700
which will depend on,
of course, the dose.

493
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,400
This is just one dose

494
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:55,120
to illustrate the point.

495
00:30:55,300 --> 00:31:01,260
Then we get our
rate of elimination

496
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,900
depending on clearance
and half-life.

497
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,460
And this time
above the minimum

498
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,580
inhibitory
concentration, this

499
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,700
is our pharmacodynamic
concept,

500
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,920
is the area under
the concentration

501
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,560
versus time curve. We

502
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,300
will be applying
this principle

503
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:26,410
here.

504
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:29,810
So the PKPD
profile and dosing.

505
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:33,290
Looking at the
left-hand side in

506
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:38,730
the darker blue
shading is the

507
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,950
concentration
-dependent killing.

508
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:44,970
This is a PKPD
profile that's called

509
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:47,150
concentration
-dependent killing.

510
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:49,530
What does that mean?

511
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:53,110
It means the rate
and extent of

512
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:55,470
bactericidal
activity increase

513
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:57,870
with increasing
concentrations.

514
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:02,550
And high peak
levels are more

515
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:06,150
effective than
low peak levels.

516
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:11,350
The rate and extent
of killing with high

517
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:17,170
peak levels is greater
than that same drug that

518
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:20,410
does not achieve those
same peak levels.

519
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:24,690
Some drugs behave
in this way.

520
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:28,950
It's just a feature
of the drug.

521
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:31,490
Let's compare that to

522
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:33,010
time-dependent killing.

523
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:37,690
The bactericidal activity
continues as long

524
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:39,890
as drug concentrations
are greater than the

525
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:43,610
MIC, the minimum
inhibitory concentration.

526
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:46,070
High peak
levels are of no

527
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:48,990
benefit for curing
the infection.

528
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:53,370
You see the difference
here? We have to keep

529
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:56,700
those drug levels above
the minimum inhibitory

530
00:32:57,270 --> 00:33:00,530
concentration. So
I am now going to

531
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:04,690
back up to that other
slide that we just saw.

532
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:07,010
Please bear with me.

533
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:12,670
So for concentration
-dependent drugs,

534
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:17,410
the high peak level
correlates with

535
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:20,750
the rate and extent
of kill. Well,

536
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:24,890
for drugs that are
time greater than MIC,

537
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:30,230
it is the time
above the MIC that

538
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:33,570
determines the
effectiveness of

539
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:35,550
the drug. That's
the difference.

540
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:40,510
While we're on this
slide, I'm going

541
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:43,330
to talk about post
-antibiotic effect.

542
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:49,140
post antibiotic
and that's not

543
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,790
explained on
the next slide

544
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:55,710
post and of course
everything has to

545
00:33:55,710 --> 00:34:00,110
have an acronym in
medicine it seems like

546
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:04,860
so post antibiotic
effect occurs

547
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:08,250
for the time frame
that the drug

548
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:12,430
concentration is
below the MIC.

549
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:16,450
So that would be this
part of the curve.

550
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:21,720
For drugs that have
a concentration

551
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:24,590
-dependent action,
that's this one up here,

552
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:30,590
it takes a while for
regrowth to occur.

553
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:38,150
So no regrowth for
a certain amount

554
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:40,610
of time, for
some time frame.

555
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:44,610
And that's going to
depend on the drug.

556
00:34:45,910 --> 00:34:48,470
And that depends
probably on the mechanism

557
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:51,130
of action of the drug.
So this is a post

558
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:54,750
-antibiotic effect down
here where there is

559
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:57,970
no growth. And we see
this the longest times

560
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:01,270
with the concentration
-dependent drugs.

561
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:05,330
Now, Now, drugs
that are T greater

562
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:13,020
than MIC tend to
have minimal post

563
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:21,650
-antibiotic effect. So
for these drugs, if

564
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:26,190
the concentration
falls down for any

565
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:29,570
appreciable length
of time, those

566
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:32,010
organisms are going
to start to regrow.

567
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:36,470
so what do we need
to do we need to give

568
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:40,930
doses more frequently
so here and then

569
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:48,010
another dose and then
another dose no I did

570
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:51,770
that wrong these drugs
we don't need that

571
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:54,810
big peak so it's going
to be like this so

572
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:08,950
the time above the
MIC is so the drug

573
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:11,790
stays above the MIC
for the maximal amount

574
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:13,510
of time. That's what
I'm trying to say.

575
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:16,770
Now, for drugs with
concentration-dependent

576
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:19,180
effect, we might give
another dose here

577
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:26,050
and achieve the same
peak. And you see

578
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:28,770
we have this time
frame here that's okay

579
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,870
because the organisms
are not growing

580
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:33,090
again. But of course,
we want to give another

581
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:35,230
dose before they
start growing again

582
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:39,410
so I'm just going to
recap that this is

583
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:46,670
concentration dependent
effect so T greater

584
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:53,690
than MIC would be
more like this other

585
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:00,310
dose

586
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:05,590
and another dose

587
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,770
So I think you get
the point, right?

588
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,020
Centration
-dependent killing.

589
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:24,100
Dosing recommendations
to maximize

590
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:27,220
success are high
-peak concentrations

591
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:33,260
and the AUC over a
24-hour period to

592
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:36,400
the MIC ratio. I'll
describe that in a

593
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,160
moment. For time
-dependent killing,

594
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:42,160
T greater than MIC
is the one that

595
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,460
correlates with cure,
maintaining the levels

596
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:48,680
above the MIC for
greater than 50% of

597
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:51,360
the time, maybe even
90% of the time.

598
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:57,020
And we can still use
the AUC to MIC ratio

599
00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:02,040
to help determine
dosing, maximize success.

600
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:07,080
Now, post-antibiotic
effect, PAE, for

601
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:10,380
concentration-dependent
killing, it is the

602
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:13,600
greater concentration
above the MIC, so that

603
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:21,380
high peak, the longer
the post-antibiotic

604
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:24,920
effect for this group
of drugs. For those

605
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:28,960
that demonstrate
the time-dependent

606
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,960
killing, the T greater
than MIC PKPD profile,

607
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:37,320
most antibiotics
have an in vitro PAE

608
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:40,220
of greater than 1.5,
which is not a lot,

609
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,140
hours,

610
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:44,680
against susceptible
gram-positive cocci.

611
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:49,240
But they have a minimal
effect against the

612
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:53,940
gram-negative bacteria,
which are big, big

613
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:57,460
problems in terms of
resistance and disease.

614
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:01,360
Okay, let's
talk about the

615
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,500
AUC to MIC ratio a bit.

616
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,580
Clinical efficacy

617
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:08,660
correlates with
this ratio.

618
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:16,160
So this ratio, AUC
to MIC, so area under

619
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,960
the concentration
versus time curve,

620
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:22,420
divided by the
minimum inhibitory

621
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:27,540
concentration, will help
determine the dosing.

622
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,060
Dosing.

623
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:33,580
Do you have to figure
this out yourself?

624
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:36,460
No. It's in
the literature.

625
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:41,540
maximizing the total
amount in the body over

626
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:45,520
time and 24-hour
period is what's almost

627
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:53,120
always used will
correlate with cure rate

628
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:58,300
with efficacy AUC dependent
dosing recommendations

629
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:00,600
and post antibiotic
effect are

630
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:04,280
provided in drug
monographs for both the

631
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:07,590
concentration and time
-dependent antimicrobials.

632
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,340
These are the takeaways.

633
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,500
I really strongly
recommend you take

634
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:17,250
out your pen and a
piece of paper and

635
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:20,700
allow your fingers
to send information

636
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:23,980
to your brain and
recreate this table

637
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:28,660
and the chart on
the previous page.

638
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:33,240
So let's talk a
little bit about

639
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,860
pharmacokinetics now that
we talked about PKPD.

640
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:41,560
These are the basic
concepts we learned

641
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:45,100
about pharmacokinetics
in general.

642
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,540
Obviously the drug has to

643
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:50,300
get to the
site of action.

644
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,920
It must *********
to the infected

645
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,720
compartment in
a high enough

646
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,740
concentration
to be effective.

647
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,900
And what's going to
determine that? Well,

648
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,890
the properties of the
drug, the physicochemical

649
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:09,580
properties of the
drug. Is it lipophilic?

650
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:13,130
Is it hydrophilic?
Is it polar tissue

651
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:17,060
***********? Is it
going to pass through

652
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:19,560
the various barriers?
Is it going to pass

653
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,760
into the cerebrospinal
fluid? Is it going

654
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:26,520
to pass into the
prostate for a prostate

655
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:30,620
infection? So is it
going to pass through

656
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:35,860
the blood barriers to
these various organs?

657
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,760
Once it gets to
the organism,

658
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,400
is it going to
be pumped out?

659
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,880
or is it going
to be pumped out

660
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,010
by our own host
p-glycoprotein?

661
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:55,740
Now some organisms
hide in the host

662
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:58,640
cells so is the drug
going to be able to

663
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,840
********* into the
intracellular space?

664
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,120
Well polar drugs
are not, hydrophilic

665
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:08,020
drugs are not,
lipophilic drugs can.

666
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:13,360
Does the drug need
to ********* into a

667
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:17,900
vegetation in the
endocardial in the valves?

668
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:21,360
Because first of
all there are a lot

669
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:24,180
of microbes in
there so they're not

670
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:27,920
reproducing very fast
and there are a lot of

671
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,200
other deposits in
there. So it's very

672
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,960
difficult for drugs to
get into that endocardial

673
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:37,140
vegetation in order to
kill those microbes.

674
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:41,000
Same thing with
biofilms. Some organisms

675
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,660
will produce this
slime covering, and

676
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:46,240
the drug has to be
able to ********* it

677
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,780
to be able to get to
the site of action.

678
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:51,080
So ***********.

679
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:54,580
Please understand
these concepts.

680
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:00,020
administration how
are we giving the drug

681
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:05,520
can the patient take
it ****** at home do it

682
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,550
does it need to be
injected intramuscularly

683
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:10,960
or IV can the patient
use it topically for

684
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,960
let's say acne for
example so root of

685
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,340
administration is determined
by the location of

686
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:22,160
the infection how
severe the infection is.

687
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,720
If it's a small
infection on the skin,

688
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,460
something topical might
be enough, but if it's

689
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:30,540
a serious infection,
even in the skin, the

690
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:32,760
patient may need to
take it systemically.

691
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:36,080
How strong is
the patient? Does

692
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,640
the patient have
a strong immune

693
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:40,200
system? Is the
patient already ill?

694
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:43,020
How ill is the
patient? How well are

695
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:45,620
the patient's
organs functioning.

696
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:49,200
If the drug is
going to be taken

697
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,940
******, is it stable
in stomach acid?

698
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:56,060
If it's not stable
in stomach acid, it's

699
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:57,620
going to be broken
down before it

700
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:59,860
gets to the absorptive
sites in the gut.

701
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,280
Where does it
distribute to? Does

702
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:10,040
it distribute mostly
in the fluids?

703
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:13,200
Does it get into
tissue spaces?

704
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:15,780
What is the extent of

705
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:18,020
protein binding
in the blood?

706
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,100
Because that will reduce

707
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:21,580
the amount of free drug.

708
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,920
Most of these
antibiotics generally

709
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,140
have poor
*********** into the

710
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:30,380
cerebral spinal
fluid, so into the

711
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:33,280
central nervous
system. However,

712
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:37,340
if the meninges are
inflamed, the blood

713
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:40,320
-brain barrier is going
to become leaky, and

714
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:44,280
more drug will be getting
in. So intravenous

715
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,600
administration of
an antibiotic may

716
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:50,740
produce adequate
therapeutic levels in cases

717
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:53,560
like that for the
treatment of meningitis.

718
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:58,840
How is the drug
excreted? Does it

719
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:01,720
get metabolized
in the liver? What

720
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:03,720
is the state of
the liver if so?

721
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:07,900
Is it excreted
unchanged in the urine?

722
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:11,680
Now think about this.
If a drug is excreted

723
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,810
unchanged in the urine,
there will be high

724
00:45:14,810 --> 00:45:17,220
concentrations of active
drug in the urine,

725
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:22,260
and as long as any
infection in the urinary

726
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:26,800
tract is susceptible
to that drug, the drug

727
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,380
can be useful for
urinary tract infections.

728
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:35,320
some antimicrobials
are metabolized in

729
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:39,560
the liver okay so
how do we think about

730
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:44,640
choosing our antibiotic
well mechanism of

731
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,680
action naturally what
are the what's the

732
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:51,100
pkpd profile what are
the pharmacokinetics

733
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:53,440
and pharmacodynamics
of the drug what

734
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,140
is the spectrum of
activity is the organism

735
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:59,020
going to be susceptible
to that drug?

736
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:03,420
Is the organism, if
once susceptible,

737
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:05,660
now resistant?

738
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:09,680
And what is the
inherent toxicity of the

739
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:12,060
drug for the host?
The drugs have to be

740
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:15,900
safe enough for the
host to take them.

741
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:19,540
Now, with regard to
the patient factors,

742
00:46:19,830 --> 00:46:22,620
is the drug going to
be able to get to the

743
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:25,300
site of action?
Perhaps it will in some

744
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:28,720
patients but not in
other patients. What is

745
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:31,060
the state of the
patient's immune system?

746
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:34,200
If the immune
system is suppressed

747
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:37,320
then the bacteriostatic
or fungistatic

748
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:39,600
drug would not be
the best choice.

749
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:42,660
What is the state of the

750
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:44,420
organs of elimination?

751
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:47,280
How old is the patient?
Because this is

752
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:50,600
also going to have
an effect on rates of

753
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:54,980
elimination and also
rates of distribution.

754
00:46:56,660 --> 00:46:59,100
Does the patient
have comorbidities?

755
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:00,660
Is the patient pregnant?

756
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:03,240
Is the patient
breastfeeding? If

757
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:08,020
breastfeeding, is that
antimicrobial going

758
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:13,000
to be entering the
breast milk and

759
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,840
therefore taken up by
the nursing infant?

760
00:47:16,350 --> 00:47:18,820
does the patient have
any allergies naturally

761
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:20,840
maybe i should put
that first always

762
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:24,020
always always ask about
allergies even if i

763
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:27,420
don't use them in my
case vignettes always

764
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:31,380
you you in your own
mind ask yourself does

765
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:34,260
this patient have any
allergies and if it's

766
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:36,620
a case vignette a
question on an exam

767
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:39,780
whatever if allergies
is not mentioned then

768
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:43,540
assume no allergies but
not in a real person

769
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:45,900
Always, always,
always ask

770
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:47,900
about allergies
and be specific.

771
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,480
Drug interactions,
of course, and cost.

772
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,500
If the patient
can't afford the

773
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,300
medication, the
patient's not

774
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:57,930
going to get
the medication.

775
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:03,060
The concentration of
antibiotic must be

776
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:05,520
adequate to kill or
prevent growth of the

777
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,360
infective microorganism
while being

778
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:11,880
tolerable to the host.
This is a key point.

779
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:17,800
Please also be familiar
with these points.

780
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:21,600
Because you
will be treating

781
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,560
patients. You
might as well get

782
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,460
used to thinking
about this now.

783
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:32,640
Goals. We always
must consider the

784
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,720
goals of therapy.
Whatever the therapy

785
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:37,940
is, whether it's
OMM, whether it's

786
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:39,980
physical therapy,
whether it's drug

787
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:42,460
therapy, we must
consider the goals.

788
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:46,540
So with antimicrobial
therapy, there are

789
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:49,240
different ways to think
about this. And I put

790
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:54,780
again here, no, because
you will be treating

791
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,400
patients and you want
to do it properly.

792
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:02,920
I have described these
on the next slide,

793
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:04,860
so I'll just quickly
go through here.

794
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:08,900
This is a timeline
to help you kind of

795
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:12,600
visualize these various
therapeutic goals.

796
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:14,500
Preventive treatment,

797
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:17,020
prophylactic
therapy, preemptive,

798
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:20,000
empiric, definitive,

799
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:22,660
suppressive,
and combination.

800
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,300
Speaking of combination,

801
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:31,240
we want to use one
drug wherever possible.

802
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,380
One,

803
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:36,700
it's likely to be
safer for the patient.

804
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:39,480
Two, it's likely to
be more affordable

805
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:42,300
for the patient and
the healthcare system.

806
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:47,420
But if combination
therapy is needed, do not

807
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:50,200
be afraid to use it
because you're thinking

808
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:54,990
about cost. you must
give the best therapy

809
00:49:54,990 --> 00:49:59,980
for the patient so why
would we use combinations

810
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:04,200
to so they work
together for a greater

811
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:08,740
effect or to broaden
the spectrum if it's

812
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:12,840
needed unfortunately
there is no antimicrobial

813
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:17,160
that will have a broad
enough spectrum on

814
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:20,640
its own especially when
thinking about empiric

815
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:23,240
therapy. So let's
look at all of these.

816
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:25,660
So prevention.

817
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,440
Prophylactic therapy
to prevent an

818
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:31,780
infection in people
at high risk. We

819
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:34,040
don't use it for
people at low risk.

820
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:37,180
The likelihood of
someone at low risk for

821
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:40,840
infection to get the
infection isn't worth

822
00:50:40,850 --> 00:50:45,860
the exposing the patient
to the antimicrobial.

823
00:50:45,930 --> 00:50:48,940
So when would we use
preventive therapy?

824
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:51,580
Well, if a patient's
having surgery and

825
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:55,420
we want to prevent
introduction of infection

826
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:59,580
into the surgical
wound, if a patient

827
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:03,880
has immunosuppression
and will not have the

828
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:08,120
full complement of
the immune response to

829
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:11,890
protect them from a
potential infection.

830
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:18,120
And an endocarditis.
This is for

831
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:20,620
certain patients who
are at high risk for

832
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:22,980
developing endocarditis
from a dental

833
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:26,140
surgery, then
prophylactic therapy

834
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:28,320
with antibiotic
may be appropriate.

835
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:30,680
Now, preemptive.

836
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:36,580
If a patient is
likely to be exposed

837
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:40,500
to a dangerous
infectious organism,

838
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:49,940
no, let me restate
that. If the patient is

839
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:53,740
exposed to a dangerous
infective organism

840
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:57,800
and should not develop
that infection, is

841
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:00,500
at high risk for
developing that infection,

842
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:03,720
then it might be
appropriate to give

843
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:08,560
preemptive antimicrobial
to prevent that

844
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:10,700
infection. And a
great example here

845
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:12,960
is a patient who has
been getting a stem

846
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,720
cell transplant.
Also, you may hear

847
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:17,690
about that as a bone
marrow transplant.

848
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:21,040
And they are at high
risk for this virus

849
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:24,860
that's called
cytomegalovirus. then they can

850
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:30,680
be given an antimicrobial,
an antiviral,

851
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:36,920
to prevent the CMV
that's being transplanted

852
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:40,300
into them from
developing the infection.

853
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:43,600
Empiric therapy.
You're going

854
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:44,880
to be seeing this a lot.

855
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:50,960
use immediate use
of a patient who is

856
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:54,400
presenting with signs
and symptoms of infection

857
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:58,400
and that infection
is so serious that

858
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:02,740
antibiotic therapy cannot
wait for determining

859
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:05,480
exactly what's
causing the infection

860
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:09,340
so this is an example
of when a broad

861
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:13,180
spectrum antimicrobial
agent would be used

862
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:16,580
because we don't know
exactly what's causing

863
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:19,070
the infection. We have
to cover everything

864
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:21,640
that's possibly
causing the infection.

865
00:53:23,330 --> 00:53:25,500
And sometimes,
very often,

866
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:28,420
combination therapy
is used here in

867
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:30,820
order to broaden
the spectrum.

868
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,260
Definitive therapy.

869
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:35,840
Well,

870
00:53:36,370 --> 00:53:40,600
now we know what it
is. the information has

871
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:44,830
come back from a
microbiology lab and says

872
00:53:44,830 --> 00:53:47,640
we have found that
it's this organism

873
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:51,900
and it is susceptible
to these antibiotics

874
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:54,940
now it's up to the
clinician the practitioner

875
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:58,380
to determine what
or what antibiotic

876
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:02,320
would be best to treat
the patient with this

877
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:06,760
infection And we aim
for a narrow-spectrum

878
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:10,380
antimicrobial agent
that is specifically

879
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:14,820
directed at that organism.
So it's definitive

880
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:18,320
therapy. It's a well
-defined organism.

881
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:23,220
And we use narrow
-spectrum because

882
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:25,500
it's less likely,
well, it's

883
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:28,800
associated with fewer
adverse effects.

884
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:33,640
Suppressive
therapy. This is for

885
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:36,080
immunosuppressed
individuals. They've

886
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:38,020
been treated for
some infection.

887
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:43,080
The infection will
not completely

888
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:45,150
go away. It's
just suppressed.

889
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:50,400
And so suppressive
therapy is used to prevent

890
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:53,440
the infection from
becoming full-blown.

891
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:56,820
And combination,
I mentioned that

892
00:54:56,820 --> 00:55:00,540
here with the empiric
therapy to for

893
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:03,820
the synergy. In
other words, the two

894
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:06,100
together is
greater, produces a

895
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:10,340
greater effect than
either one alone.

896
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:14,720
And that's it. So please

897
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,980
understand these
various goals.

898
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:21,020
Goals, always know
your goals of therapy.

899
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:26,300
and finally we'll
talk about antibiotic

900
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:31,440
stewardship we are
all responsible

901
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:35,330
for the
appropriate use of

902
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:38,260
antimicrobials to
improve patient outcomes

903
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:44,340
reduce microbial
resistance decrease

904
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:48,640
the spread of
infection caused by

905
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:56,740
Organisms that are
resistant to many drugs.

906
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:01,820
Yes, you do need
to understand

907
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:04,020
about antibiotic
stewardship.

908
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:08,160
These are
programs, actually.

909
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:12,740
I would say probably
all United States

910
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:16,440
hospitals have
stewardship programs that

911
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:20,760
promote the appropriate
use of antibiotics

912
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:24,880
and other antimicrobials
to improve patient

913
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:29,960
outcomes, reduce
microbial resistance,

914
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,860
and decrease the
spread of multidrug

915
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:38,080
-resistant organisms.
Those are the goals of

916
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:43,740
antibiotic stewardship
programs. Reduce

917
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:45,990
antibiotic consumption
and inappropriate

918
00:56:45,990 --> 00:56:51,740
use. This is an
infection caused by a gut

919
00:56:51,740 --> 00:57:03,320
organism as a result
of antibiotic use.

920
00:57:03,980 --> 00:57:06,660
is a secondary infection.

921
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:10,040
Antibiotics kill
off many of the gut

922
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:14,340
bugs, but not
clostridioides difficile.

923
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:16,960
It tends to
overgrow, and it can

924
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:21,740
cause diarrhea
through death.

925
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:25,600
Improved patient
outcomes.

926
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:29,240
Guidelines.
Sticking to the

927
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:32,000
guidelines. Utilizing
the guidelines.

928
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:34,980
Reducing adverse
drug events, that's

929
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:38,120
always a goal with
our therapies.

930
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:40,880
And decrease or limit

931
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:42,420
antibiotic resistance.

932
00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:47,480
Fortunately, there
is some data that

933
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:49,020
demonstrates
that antibiotic

934
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:52,220
stewardships do do
that to some extent.

935
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:57,120
Five D's of antibiotic
stewardship. The

936
00:57:57,120 --> 00:58:00,780
right drug, at the right
time, for the right

937
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:04,260
diagnosis, for the
right duration of time.

938
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:06,180
And I put in here for

939
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:07,520
the right patient also.

940
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:11,900
In summary,

941
00:58:12,650 --> 00:58:14,540
antimicrobial
agents work by

942
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:16,440
targeting specific
elements in the

943
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:18,480
biochemical pathways
of pathogens.

944
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:22,620
Determinants of
success include proper

945
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:26,740
selection of the
antimicrobial drug. based on

946
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:30,000
selective toxicity,
spectrums of activity,

947
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:31,700
laboratory identification

948
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:33,700
and susceptibility
testing,

949
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:37,020
dosing that
achieves the proper

950
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:39,700
concentration at
the site of action,

951
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:41,780
so PKPED,

952
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:45,400
knowledge of drug
*********** into the

953
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:48,060
infected compartment.
It's great when the

954
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:51,660
microbiology lab comes
back and says, it's

955
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:54,700
this organism and it's
susceptible to this

956
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:56,460
drug. Well, if the
drug doesn't get

957
00:58:56,460 --> 00:58:59,660
there, it's not going
to kill the organism.

958
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:02,300
And, of course,
a dosing schedule

959
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:05,540
that maximizes
antimicrobial effect.

960
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:08,380
That's what that
whole thing was with

961
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:12,580
PK-PD profiles,
AUC to MIC ratio.

962
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:16,500
A proper dose and
dosing schedule are

963
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:20,500
chosen by integrating
microbial pharmacokinetics

964
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:22,580
and pharmacodynamics
information.

965
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:26,500
expected pharmacokinetics
variability and

966
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:29,040
the minimum inhibitory
concentration of

967
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:31,760
the pathogen in the
individual patient.

968
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,420
Goals of therapy
should be

969
00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:37,640
clear. Always,
always, always.

970
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:40,700
Prophylaxis, preemptive
therapy, empirical

971
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:43,120
therapy, definitive
therapy should have

972
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:44,920
treatment goals and
duration of therapy

973
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:48,440
clearly spelled out
in the beginning based

974
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:51,280
on proper evidence.
And I see I left off

975
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:54,680
this list, suppressive
therapy as well.

976
00:59:59,730 --> 01:00:03,190
The general rule is
one drug except in

977
01:00:03,190 --> 01:00:05,140
selected situations
where combination

978
01:00:05,140 --> 01:00:07,840
therapy has been
shown to be superior.

979
01:00:08,090 --> 01:00:12,070
Poor dosing
strategies lead to

980
01:00:12,070 --> 01:00:18,710
catastrophic
outcomes such as drug

981
01:00:18,710 --> 01:00:21,770
resistance, toxicity
to the patients.

982
01:00:24,310 --> 01:00:26,350
Antimicrobial
stewardship practices

983
01:00:26,350 --> 01:00:30,750
promote the proper
use of antimicrobials,

984
01:00:30,750 --> 01:00:33,610
improve patient
outcomes, and

985
01:00:33,610 --> 01:00:35,970
reduce the development
of resistance.

986
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:44,200
Here is a chart
from the World

987
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:46,860
Health Organization.
This is a global

988
01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:49,620
problem. Antibiotic
resistance.

989
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:54,320
Hopefully it'll take
a few minutes to

990
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:58,420
take a look at this
because we are all

991
01:00:58,420 --> 01:01:01,440
responsible for
antibiotic stewardship

992
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:07,020
practices and reducing
the risk of resistance.

993
01:01:07,020 --> 01:01:10,080
That whole thing
comes down to patient

994
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:14,520
care, patient
effectiveness. If we

995
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:17,440
have antibiotics that
work we can treat.

996
01:01:18,340 --> 01:01:22,140
And that concludes
this lecture.
