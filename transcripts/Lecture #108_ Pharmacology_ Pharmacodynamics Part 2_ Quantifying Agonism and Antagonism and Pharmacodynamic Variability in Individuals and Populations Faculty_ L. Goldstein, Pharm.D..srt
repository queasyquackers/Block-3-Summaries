00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:03,070
Welcome students
to the second part

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:06,110
of our pharmacodynamics
lectures.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,510
In this lecture,

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,750
we will talk about
quantifying agonism

5
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:14,290
and antagonism,
various models,

6
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,470
receptor dynamics,

7
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:19,510
and pharmacodynamic
variability in a

8
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:22,470
population. Dr.
Goldstein speaking.

9
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,710
I extend an
invitation for a

10
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:30,130
pharmacology chat.
If you would like

11
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:33,130
groups or individuals,
all welcome.

12
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,850
Just email me and we'll
set up an appointment

13
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:39,850
that's convenient for
both or all of us.

14
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,790
Here are the learning
objectives. Just to

15
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:46,750
remind you, this is
the answer to the

16
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:50,150
question, what do I need
to know? now, so that

17
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,970
you can focus your
studies and try and

18
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,530
avoid going down rabbit
holes. As interesting

19
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,750
as they are, they can
take up your time.

20
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:03,270
Compare and contrast
the actions and effects

21
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,910
of agonists and
antagonists as illustrated

22
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:10,090
by specific concentration
effect curves.

23
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:13,010
We talked about
those dose-response

24
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:15,670
relationships concentration
effect curves in

25
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:18,690
the part one lecture
and now we're going

26
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:21,850
to apply it to agonists
and antagonists.

27
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:26,550
We're going to talk
about them in the context

28
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:29,430
of the classical
receptor occupancy model

29
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:32,230
and the two-state
receptor occupancy model.

30
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:35,050
We're going to talk
about competitive

31
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:38,070
antagonists, non
-competitive antagonists,

32
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,930
negative and
positive allosteric

33
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,650
modulators, and
spare receptors as

34
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:46,290
demonstrated in
experimental sample models.

35
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:50,050
We're going to relate
the drug action,

36
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:52,610
receptor occupancy,
receptor response,

37
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:54,530
and receptor
regulation based on

38
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:57,850
concentration effect
curves and receptor

39
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:00,870
binding of agonists
and antagonists.

40
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,610
And finally,

41
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,490
we will explain the
pharmacodynamic variabilities

42
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:09,770
in a population
and calculate the

43
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:14,230
therapeutic index when
given the quantal dose

44
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:16,950
response curves. These
are the things that

45
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:21,230
you should be able to
do after you've become

46
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:24,370
familiar with the
concepts in this lecture.

47
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:32,650
And here are the
preparation materials in

48
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:35,350
the CPG and also on
these slides. Scholar

49
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:37,930
Rx Bricks, Practice
questions are required.

50
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:43,610
All the rest is at
your own choice.

51
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,290
Whatever works for
you. You will have

52
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:49,130
to acquire the
knowledge, so do that

53
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:51,210
in the way that
works best for you.

54
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,660
Here are our links
to textbooks and

55
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:01,330
our receptor
occupancy model. These

56
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:03,570
are what you need
to learn about.

57
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,250
I'm not going to
read these slides.

58
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:09,710
You can read them
yourself perfectly well.

59
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:13,750
Classical receptor
occupancy model.

60
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,970
Other mechanisms of drug

61
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:20,150
antagonism.
Receptor dynamics.

62
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,310
You'll hear
about receptor

63
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:28,170
desensitization,
downregulation, tachyphylaxis,

64
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:30,790
disease, receptor
resensitization,

65
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:38,770
supersensitivity,
and pharmacodynamic

66
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:41,550
variability in
a population.

67
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:45,350
You can think about
animal experimentation,

68
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,450
you can think about
clinical trials.

69
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:52,630
So let us begin with
our receptor occupancy

70
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:56,290
models of agonists
and antagonists.

71
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:59,670
The two that
we'll talk about,

72
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:02,510
which are two
basics and as you

73
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:05,330
read about more
going through

74
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,590
your practice
life, your lifelong

75
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,550
learning, you'll
see others but

76
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,590
you can build on
these two models.

77
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:19,550
They propose explanations
of the activity

78
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:22,810
of drugs at receptors.
And these are

79
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:28,850
founded in abundant
experimentation.

80
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,730
So the two-state
receptor occupancy model,

81
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:36,830
I'm going to mention
that one first,

82
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,510
postulates

83
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,610
that the receptor assumes
two conformational

84
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:46,970
states, active and
inactive, in the

85
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:51,310
absence of a ligand.
So, it can be either

86
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:54,370
in an active state
or an inactive state.

87
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,530
We're talking about an

88
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:01,350
entire pool of receptors.

89
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:04,090
So this is called
the receptor pool.

90
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:08,410
And some of the receptors
in that pool are

91
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:11,030
in a conformational
state that's active and

92
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:14,890
it's going to produce
some basal activity.

93
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:19,990
Many receptors, I should
say many cells, need

94
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:23,480
to have some sort of
constitutive activity

95
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:25,830
in order for
us to function

96
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:28,310
as human beings,
as organisms.

97
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,530
And some of them
are going to

98
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,370
be in an inactive
conformation.

99
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:38,230
The receptor can
activate downstream

100
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:41,190
mechanisms that produce
a small observable

101
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:43,310
effect even in the
absence of a ligand

102
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,930
and it has constitutive,
other people

103
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:49,850
say constitutive,
or basal activity.

104
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,890
So that's what
we mean with the

105
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:54,890
two-state receptor
occupancy model.

106
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:58,310
There is a total
receptor pool.

107
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:01,330
Some of the
receptors are in an

108
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:04,530
active form
producing some basal

109
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,990
amount of activity
and and the others

110
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:09,190
are in an inactive
conformation.

111
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:12,410
Now the classical
receptor occupancy

112
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:14,670
model, which actually
did come first,

113
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:17,230
postulates that
receptors in a

114
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:19,570
receptor pool
are quiet unless

115
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:21,430
they are activated
by a ligand.

116
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:26,510
That ligand is usually
some natural molecule,

117
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:30,130
an endogenous molecule,
let's say epinephrine.

118
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:32,730
I used that as an
example before. 4.

119
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:37,670
Agonists bind to
receptors and stimulate

120
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:40,510
the signal transduction
pathways. Agonists

121
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:44,030
have affinity and
intrinsic activity.

122
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:47,310
5. Antagonists bind
to receptors and

123
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:51,190
inhibit or block the
biologic responses

124
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:53,610
by interfering
with the agonist's

125
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,630
ability to activate
the receptor. here.

126
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:59,890
Antagonists have
affinity, they will

127
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:03,850
bind, and the receptor
will bind to them,

128
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:06,730
but they have zero
intrinsic activity.

129
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:09,610
They are not causing
the receptor to

130
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:13,150
activate its downstream
effector mechanism.

131
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:17,030
And at the same
time, they block

132
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:19,290
the agonist from
occupying the

133
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:22,390
site, inhibitors
or blockers.

134
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:28,890
So let's take a look
at curves in the two

135
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:31,770
-state model of drug
receptor interaction.

136
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:35,470
The hypothetical
receptor is able to

137
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:37,510
assume two conformations,
I explained

138
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:41,190
that before. So,
on this figure,

139
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:45,790
we have our active
confirmation or

140
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,560
inactive confirmation.

141
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:59,460
And here we have our
drug coming in, and

142
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,820
the drug can bind to the
inactive confirmation

143
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,300
and hold it there,
or drug can bind to

144
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,400
the active confirmation
and hold it there.

145
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:13,780
So, let's take a look
now at these curves.

146
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,740
Talking about a drug.

147
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,780
So a drug that is a
full agonist, you can

148
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:26,130
see it's producing the
maximal effect, Emax.

149
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:35,140
The drug will bind to
the receptor in the

150
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:38,460
active conformation.
It has affinity for

151
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:41,360
the receptor in the
active conformation.

152
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:45,840
That's the affinity
that it has.

153
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,900
So it will shift
almost all of

154
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:52,140
the receptors
in the pool to

155
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:56,780
the active plus
drug complex,

156
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:01,500
activating the receptor
-effector systems

157
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,860
to the maximal
effect. Now let's

158
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,050
take a look at the
second curve down.

159
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:11,240
Here we have a drug
that will bind to

160
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:15,540
the active
conformation of the

161
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:18,780
receptor, but it will
also bind to a certain

162
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:22,280
extent the inactive
conformation.

163
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,540
So partial agonists
have a slightly

164
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:28,020
greater affinity for
the active conformation

165
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:31,660
than for the inactive
conformation. And

166
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,760
what is the effect
that we would see?

167
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:37,640
They do not
stabilize the active

168
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,840
conformation as much as
the full agonists do.

169
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,080
Therefore, a
significant fraction

170
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,000
of the receptors
is in the

171
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,100
inactive drug
complex form.

172
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:56,880
As a result, there
is some effect, but

173
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,460
it's not the full
effect. It's not

174
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:03,300
maximal efficacy,
it's a partial effect.

175
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:08,780
Therefore a partial
agonist produces

176
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:11,060
only the partial
effect. Now I'd

177
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,240
like, well I'll
point that out later.

178
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:18,340
Now a neutral antagonist,
here we have our

179
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:24,480
baseline constitutive
activity, a neutral

180
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:28,340
antagonist will
have equal affinity

181
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:32,580
for both the
active confirmation

182
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:35,000
and the inactive
confirmation.

183
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:39,040
And what it will
appear is that the

184
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,660
drug has no
effect. So if this

185
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:44,280
particular drug that
has the equal affinity

186
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,780
is injected into
an animal model

187
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,720
and we're looking
to see what happens,

188
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,580
it looks like
nothing changes.

189
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,120
Whatever
constitutive activity

190
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,600
was going on
continues to go on.

191
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,420
No change.

192
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,860
So it looks
like nothing is

193
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:07,460
happening. But
the drug is bound.

194
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,380
It's an antagonist
and it's bound to the

195
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:17,920
receptors and it will
prevent the agonist,

196
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,940
the full agonist or
the partial agonist

197
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,820
from binding. So it
is still inhibiting.

198
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,660
Now the inverse
agonist, I know

199
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,590
this is kind of
a confusing term,

200
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:36,480
the inverse agonist
will bind to the

201
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,320
inactive conformation
with much higher

202
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,240
affinity than it binds to
the active conformation

203
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,840
and therefore the
inverse agonist

204
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:49,500
will stabilize the
large fraction of the

205
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,860
receptors in the
inactive conformation.

206
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,520
So what do we see? What
does the researcher

207
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:59,800
see when the animal
is injected with

208
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,240
a drug that is an
inverse agonist? It will

209
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:08,880
show that there
is a decrease in

210
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,200
constitutive activity.
The effect decreases,

211
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:16,660
resulting in the effects
opposite from the

212
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:21,060
agonist. So it looks
like an inhibitor.

213
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:25,240
The observable
effect is that of

214
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,520
an inhibitor.
Nothing is happening.

215
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,360
Now the classical
receptor occupancy model,

216
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,330
this is how we talk
about mainly the

217
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:41,520
classification of
antagonist. So I want you to

218
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:49,440
just put this whole
two receptor occupancy

219
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,440
model, two receptor
confirmation occupancy

220
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:56,220
model aside for a moment.
Now you're thinking

221
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,520
about it in a completely
different way.

222
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:02,820
Competitive antagonists
compete for the

223
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:06,880
same binding site as
the agonist. So, that's

224
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,940
called the active
site. The agonist binds

225
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,120
to the active site,
produces an effect.

226
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,820
A competitive
antagonist will also

227
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:16,320
bind to the active
site, but it

228
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,460
will produce no
effect, and it will

229
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,800
prevent the agonist
from binding.

230
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,040
Pretty simple.
It's competitive,

231
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,740
so it associates,
dissociates,

232
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,420
associates, dissociates.

233
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:34,600
Now, a noncompetitive
antagonist will reduce

234
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,960
the magnitude of
the maximal response

235
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,450
that can be achieved by
any amount of agonist

236
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:42,380
without having an
effect. In other words,

237
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:47,940
it's an inhibitor, it
will block the effect

238
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:52,980
of the agonist but in
a different way than

239
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:58,920
the noncompetitive
antagonist does. So, we're

240
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,680
going to get into
more detail with that.

241
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,920
I want to draw
your attention to

242
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,340
this figure that
shows these various

243
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:12,200
actual mechanisms
of antagonism.

244
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:16,140
Receptor antagonists,
in other words,

245
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,900
they are antagonists
at the receptor.

246
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,700
And we also have non
-receptor antagonists,

247
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,620
they're antagonists
by a non-receptor

248
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,320
mechanism. them,
I'm not going to

249
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,540
go into them right
now, I will later.

250
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:32,000
So the antagonist
binds to the

251
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,630
active site,
it can bind by

252
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:39,360
far and away,
the most common

253
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:43,120
is reversible binding,
association, dissociation,

254
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,160
association,
dissociation, that's a

255
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,070
competitive antagonist.
Now, there are a few

256
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:51,000
that will bind
irreversibly to the active

257
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,840
site, and because it's
occupying that site

258
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,140
irreversibly, the
agonist cannot get to it.

259
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,440
And then there's the
allosteric binding,

260
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,140
which means to a
neighboring site, it's not

261
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:10,000
the active site, and
it will cause, it will

262
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,900
bind and cause a
conformational change such

263
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:17,860
that But the agonist
is unable to bind with

264
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:21,180
its usual affinity to
the active site and

265
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:24,640
therefore does not
activate the receptor.

266
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:27,190
Now these two can
be reversible and

267
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:28,660
irreversible,
and these are

268
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:31,520
noncompetitive
allosteric antagonists.

269
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:38,810
So we have curves
to demonstrate what

270
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:40,410
we're talking
about. Let's start

271
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:42,990
with the competitive
antagonist, which

272
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:46,670
is illustrated in
the top figure.

273
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:50,310
Competitive here.

274
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:52,450
This is the
active site here.

275
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:54,810
And you can see
they both have

276
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:56,650
affinity for
the active site.

277
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:59,210
Now how do we demonstrate

278
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:00,950
this experimentally?

279
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:05,710
With our agonist
curves. So here's

280
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:10,030
the starting point,
right here, the

281
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:12,910
control they call
it. So that's the

282
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:15,290
agonist is injected
and we see some

283
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:17,530
response, here's our
maximal response,

284
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:21,110
that occurs at
this concentration.

285
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:26,330
Now, if a competitive
antagonist is

286
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:31,130
injected into this
animal, and then,

287
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:34,090
this is a certain
concentration and then

288
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:37,450
the agonist is injected
again, now at a

289
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:41,210
higher concentration,
the agonist will be

290
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:44,850
able to out-compete
the antagonist at the

291
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:47,450
receptor site and
again produce the

292
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:50,390
maximal effect, but we
see it takes a greater

293
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:55,110
concentration of
agonist to achieve

294
00:16:55,110 --> 00:17:01,580
that. And more competitive
antagonist, again

295
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,200
achievable with a
greater concentration

296
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:07,490
of the agonist, etc.,
on down the line.

297
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:11,440
This is an
experimental situation

298
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:15,630
to demonstrate
that a competitive

299
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:18,570
antagonist can
be outcompeted

300
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:20,770
if the concentration of

301
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:22,610
agonist is high enough.

302
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:29,630
Now an irreversible
active site

303
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:32,010
antagonist is
indicated here.

304
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:36,330
It binds to the active
site, the agonist

305
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:42,530
cannot bind, and with
increasing concentrations

306
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:44,990
of irreversible
antagonist, the

307
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:53,210
effect is totally
reduced, agonist effect.

308
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:57,650
Now here we have a
positive allosteric

309
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:02,890
modulator. Now this
is not an inhibitor.

310
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:07,550
It's actually
activating the receptor.

311
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:08,830
So what's happening
here? receptor.

312
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:11,650
This is our
control again.

313
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:15,210
This would be
the regular Emax.

314
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:22,530
A drug that binds to
an allosteric site,

315
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:25,090
so it's a neighboring
site and it's going

316
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:28,290
to cause a conformational
change in the

317
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:32,990
receptor active site
such that it actually

318
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:36,910
enhances the affinity
of the agonist,

319
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:40,350
whether that's a
natural receptor agonist

320
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:43,970
or a drug, so that
it produces an effect

321
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:47,310
that's above the usual
maximal effect. So

322
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:50,890
this is a positive
allosteric modulator.

323
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:56,390
It's producing a
positive effect on the

324
00:18:56,390 --> 00:19:01,530
receptor's action. A
negative allosteric

325
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:05,030
modulator, now this is
going to be an inhibitor,

326
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:09,670
is going to bind to
the allosteric site,

327
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:14,310
the neighboring site
near the active site

328
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:17,430
and cause a conformational
change in the

329
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:22,210
active site such that
the affinity is reduced

330
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:25,470
for the agonist and
the efficacy for the

331
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:28,410
agonist is reduced.
And here we have this,

332
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:31,830
this is control, the
usual Emax right here.

333
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:35,250
And with the reduction
in the affinity

334
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:39,190
for the site,
depending on how much

335
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:44,710
allosteric modulator
is there and whether

336
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:48,030
or not it's reversible,
it will cause a

337
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:50,970
decrease in the
effect of the agonist.

338
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:59,970
so that is the classic
receptor theory up

339
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:02,990
till now we've been
talking about antagonism

340
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:09,190
by drugs at the
same receptor as the

341
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:14,430
drug of interest receptor
mediated antagonism

342
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:17,210
These other mechanisms
are different.

343
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:20,750
They are not receptor
-mediated. The

344
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:25,150
antagonist drug will
act at a totally

345
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:28,810
different receptor,
possibly even

346
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:31,850
a totally different
organ system.

347
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:35,910
So a physiologic
antagonist, called

348
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:38,130
often a functional
antagonist, is a

349
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:40,250
substance that
produces physiologic

350
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,490
effects that
are opposite the

351
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:45,410
physiologic effects
of another substance.

352
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,390
In other words,
their functions are

353
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:51,330
different. They act on
different regulatory

354
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:56,330
pathways mediated by
different receptors.

355
00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:00,190
Typical examples
are insulin,

356
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:01,850
which reduces
blood sugar, and

357
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:04,050
glucagon, that
increases blood sugar.

358
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:06,890
Methacholine, which
is a drug that

359
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:09,470
causes
bronchoconstriction, while

360
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:11,450
albuterol causes
bronchodilation.

361
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:13,350
Opposite effects.

362
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:16,430
A chemical antagonist
is a compound

363
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:19,470
that directly interacts
with the agonist,

364
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:23,150
such that the
agonist is no longer

365
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:28,150
able to travel to and
bind its receptor.

366
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:30,810
The combination product

367
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:33,930
is inactive and excreted.

368
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:36,830
Examples here are heparin

369
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:38,360
bound by protamine,

370
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:41,310
divalent cations
and antacids

371
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:43,030
that chelate
certain drugs,

372
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:46,370
tetracycline being
a typical example,

373
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,350
Cholestyramine,
that is an exchange

374
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:53,250
resin that
sequesters drugs.

375
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:56,030
Cholestyramine
is not absorbed,

376
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:58,010
therefore the drugs
are not absorbed.

377
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:02,030
And I will elaborate on

378
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,490
these mechanisms here.

379
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:07,290
Insulin is secreted from

380
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:08,870
the endocrine pancreas.

381
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:13,570
It acts on insulin
receptors on

382
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:15,410
various cells,
certain cells.

383
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:19,850
and causes glucose
uptake storage

384
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,270
and therefore
removes glucose from

385
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:25,390
the blood sugar,
lowering blood sugar.

386
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:29,490
Glucagon also
comes from the

387
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:31,250
endocrine
pancreas, different

388
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:36,050
cells, and it
acts at the liver,

389
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:43,510
causing gluconeogenesis,
synthesis of

390
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:47,430
glucose, which then
increases blood sugar.

391
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:51,970
This concept has a
clinical application

392
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:55,670
because insulin
and glucon are both

393
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:59,170
available in drug
form. They can be

394
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:02,450
injected. So for
an individual, a

395
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:05,490
diabetic, who has
hypoglycemia, this is

396
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:10,310
a serious adverse
effect of insulin,

397
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:13,410
glucagon can be
administered to

398
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:15,930
increase the
synthesis of glucose

399
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:19,670
in the liver and
counteract the

400
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:22,050
hypoglycemia, raise
the blood sugar.

401
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:27,490
Inhaled methicoline
is a drug that's

402
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:30,740
given as something called
a bronchoprovocation

403
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:34,950
test for diagnosis
of asthma.

404
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:38,670
It will act on
muscarinic receptors

405
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,430
in, that's not
a very good M,

406
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:47,990
muscarinic receptors
in bronchial smooth

407
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:51,070
muscle and that will
cause contraction or

408
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:54,890
constriction. We see
that here. The airway is

409
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:59,370
very narrowed and that
reduces the amount

410
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:03,670
of air that can get
through the bronchus.

411
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,950
Albuterol must be
kept close at hand

412
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:09,110
when When
methacholine is being

413
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:11,110
administered,
albuterol is also

414
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:14,380
inhaled, and it is
a sympathomimetic.

415
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:18,370
It acts on beta
-2 adrenergic

416
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:20,690
receptors. These
are obviously

417
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:23,310
different types
of receptors.

418
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:28,410
That will cause bronchial

419
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:30,330
smooth muscle relaxation,

420
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:35,330
bronchial dilation,
opening of the airway.

421
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:42,750
opposite effects two
drugs acting in the

422
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:46,090
same tissues but on
different receptors

423
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:52,010
now the chemical
antagonists bind

424
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:56,310
directly combined
directly with the drug

425
00:24:56,310 --> 00:25:01,430
the typical example
is heparin, which

426
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:04,490
is a negatively
charged molecule.

427
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:09,270
When it is given
an overdose, this

428
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:11,170
is going to be an
accidental problem,

429
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:18,090
protamine may be
administered to combine

430
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:21,830
with the heparin.
and protamine is

431
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:24,970
a protein that's
positively charged.

432
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:30,070
And then this
combined product

433
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:33,470
here is inactive,
the heparin is

434
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:37,070
inactive, and
it is excreted.

435
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:42,610
Tetracycline is
an antibiotic,

436
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:45,350
one, two, three,
four, four cycles,

437
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:46,500
hence the name
tetracycline.

438
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:52,830
It is chelated by
polyvalent metal

439
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:57,550
ions, such as are
found in antacids, in

440
00:25:57,550 --> 00:26:01,010
the gut, and therefore
the absorption

441
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:04,410
is reduced,
significantly reduced.

442
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:07,650
Cholestyramine has
a similar idea.

443
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:10,450
Cholestyramine is
not absorbed. It

444
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:14,530
will sequester
the drug and carry

445
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:16,900
it out. The drug
is not absorbed.

446
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:22,210
So those are examples
of functional or

447
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:25,510
physiologic and
chemical antagonists.

448
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:29,610
So I'm inviting
you to pause the

449
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:31,690
video and answer
these questions.

450
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:35,510
What is the difference
between the two

451
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,450
-state receptor
occupancy model and

452
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:39,570
the classical receptor
occupancy model

453
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:42,650
explaining drug
receptor interactions?

454
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:45,790
And how are antagonists
classified and

455
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:48,190
what are the effects
on agonist efficacy?

456
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:51,410
Now would be a
good time to pause.

457
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:57,230
So you're back now,
and the answer to the

458
00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:01,070
first question is,
the two-state receptor

459
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:04,650
occupancy model
posits that receptors

460
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:08,850
in the receptor pool
exist in an inactive

461
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:11,770
and an active
conformation in the

462
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:14,530
absence of ligand,
with the equilibrium

463
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:17,890
favoring the inactive
state. The drug binding

464
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:20,830
to the receptors
shifts the equilibrium

465
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:23,230
depending on the drug's
relative affinities

466
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:26,350
for the active and
inactive states.

467
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:29,590
And the second question.

468
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:33,670
The classical model
posits that receptors

469
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:35,490
in a receptor
pool are quiet,

470
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:38,910
quiescent, unless
activated by a ligand.

471
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,970
Agonists have affinity
for receptors and

472
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:44,470
activate the receptors
effector pathways.

473
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,910
Antagonists have
affinity for

474
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:49,030
receptors but do
not activate the

475
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:51,830
receptors and they
prevent the agonist

476
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:53,870
from activating
the receptors.

477
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:58,370
Competitive
antagonists compete for

478
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:00,490
the same binding
site as the agonist

479
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:03,630
and affect the
amount of agonist

480
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:06,190
needed to achieve
a maximal response.

481
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:09,830
Non-competitive
antagonists reduce the

482
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:12,890
magnitude of the maximal
response that can be

483
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:16,410
achieved by any amount
of agonist without having

484
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:19,810
an effect on the binding
of the agonist to

485
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:23,210
the receptor. This is
because the noncompetitive

486
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:26,370
antagonists either
irreversibly occupy

487
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:31,610
the active site or more
commonly bind to an

488
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:35,070
allosteric site, a
site nearby, changing

489
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:39,410
the shape of the active
site, the confirmation

490
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:44,450
of the active site,
reducing the affinity

491
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:47,130
of the receptor for the
drug and vice versa.

492
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:51,650
Receptor dynamics now.

493
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:54,470
Everything in
our bodies is

494
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:56,750
dynamic,
changing, moving,

495
00:28:57,010 --> 00:28:58,450
reaching equilibrium,

496
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:00,080
falling out of
equilibrium.

497
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:03,250
And receptor
dynamics is a

498
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:06,310
cellular regulation
that allows our

499
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:08,080
bodies to stay
in homeostasis.

500
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:11,630
Cellular regulation
of drug receptor

501
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:14,370
interactions prevents
overstimulation that

502
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:18,030
can harm the cell or
the entire organism.

503
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:20,550
As a result of
the physiologic

504
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:23,570
regulation,
many drugs show

505
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:25,750
diminishing
effects over time.

506
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:30,190
So we have some
terms here.

507
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:34,010
A diminished response,
frequently called

508
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:39,530
tolerance, due to
exposure to an agonist.

509
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:46,670
Receptor desensitization
is a decrease

510
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:49,350
in the coupling
efficiency of receptors.

511
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:51,870
The receptor and
the cell become

512
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:54,630
unresponsive or
insensitive to the

513
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:56,830
action of the drug
even in the continued

514
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:58,980
presence of the
drug. And I will

515
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:01,170
illustrate this
on the next slide.

516
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:04,890
Receptor downregulation
is just a decrease

517
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:07,730
in the number of
receptors which occurs

518
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:11,410
by internalizing, the
cell internalizing

519
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:16,730
the receptor drug
complex, and we'll

520
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:18,810
talk about that on
the next slide too.

521
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:22,650
When the rate of
receptor degradation

522
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:26,490
is faster than new
receptor synthesis,

523
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,830
fewer receptors
are present on

524
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:31,330
the cell surface
and responsiveness

525
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:33,390
to the agonist
is diminished.

526
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:37,990
Tachyphylaxis is
an acute, sudden

527
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:40,530
decrease in response
after continuous or

528
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:42,790
repeated administration
of the drug.

529
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:49,570
Now receptor
resensitization occurs

530
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:52,910
when the agonist is
withdrawn, in other

531
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:55,220
words the drug
is stopped, cells

532
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:58,030
recover full responsiveness
to a subsequent

533
00:30:58,030 --> 00:31:00,010
addition of the
agonist, which I

534
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:02,810
will show you on
the next slide also.

535
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:07,190
Now there is something
called increased

536
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:09,610
sensitivity,
supersensitivity.

537
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:14,430
And this occurs in
the presence of an

538
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:18,030
antagonist where
there is insertion of

539
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:20,130
an increased number
of receptors because

540
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:22,930
of the presence
of the antagonist.

541
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,970
And that can make
the cells more

542
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:27,070
sensitive to an
agonist. And I'll get to

543
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:29,150
that, an illustration
of that as well.

544
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:36,590
Okay, we have panel
A and panel B. Panel

545
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:39,910
A is on top, panel
B is underneath it.

546
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:42,490
Panel A you can
see is a curve.

547
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:48,370
And this is an
example of the beta

548
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:51,130
receptor that I
referred to before,

549
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:55,090
which is called
a beta adrenergic

550
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:58,310
receptor or an
adrenoccepter.

551
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,790
So you can imagine
we're talking

552
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:05,710
about the beta
receptors on cardiac

553
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:07,350
tissue. We could
be talking about

554
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:10,230
beta receptors
in the bronchi.

555
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:13,550
We could be talking
about other types of

556
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:15,790
G protein coupled
receptors. measures.

557
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:21,670
We see that a dose
is given here, full

558
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:24,670
response, okay,
that's what we expect.

559
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:34,230
Over time, the effect
diminishes, even

560
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:37,070
though the same
amount of drug is

561
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:39,910
being given, to the
point where there's

562
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:42,310
really a very low
effect. effect.

563
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:46,210
So this could be
desensitization that's

564
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:48,590
occurring, downregulation
that's occurring,

565
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:52,370
and if it happens
fairly rapidly,

566
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:53,760
we call that
tachyphylaxis.

567
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:56,870
Now, the drug is stopped.

568
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:58,250
No drug.

569
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:01,430
Certain time frame,
whatever it is,

570
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:04,550
and the drug is
restarted at the

571
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:07,170
same dose dose, and
achieves the same

572
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:10,290
maximal effect
after that pause.

573
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:13,270
But of course tachyphylaxis
happens again.

574
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:16,470
And we think about that
very frequently with

575
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:20,270
opioids for example,
opiates, where they

576
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:24,860
achieve a certain degree
of efficacy initially

577
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:28,210
and then over time
the patient tends to

578
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:30,830
become tolerant to
that particular dose,

579
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:34,330
requiring a larger dose
to get the same effect.

580
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:36,650
Now let's look at the

581
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:38,550
mechanism here
on panel B.

582
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:46,450
Here we have our
agonist drug binding to

583
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:50,930
the receptor, and
if you count up all

584
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:54,670
these pass-throughs,
the membrane, you can

585
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:56,840
see it's the G protein
coupled receptor.

586
00:33:57,670 --> 00:34:03,530
And the agonist
is here and it

587
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:06,890
activates this
downstream effect.

588
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:16,300
And at some point
inside the cell it gets

589
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:19,770
phosphorylated and beta
-arrestins bind here.

590
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:23,830
And that desensitizes
the receptor. It

591
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:26,450
will not be able
to respond anymore.

592
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:30,030
That's the theory
of how it works.

593
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:34,490
Then this receptor
moves on down here.

594
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,130
Let's say this
is a receptor

595
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:40,370
and it is being
endocytosed.

596
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:46,650
And here we have it
down here. You can

597
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:50,150
see the drug drug and
the receptor are in

598
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:53,290
the endosome. Now
this can go two ways.

599
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:58,770
It can be reintroduced

600
00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:02,190
back to the plasma
membrane, drug

601
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:04,550
binds, we get the
full efficacy again.

602
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:08,990
Or it can be

603
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:15,350
degraded in the
lysosome. And when

604
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:16,510
this happens,
this is called

605
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:19,790
downregulation, new
receptors need to

606
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:21,610
be formed and that
can take time.

607
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:29,650
So that is a
description of receptor

608
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:35,870
desensitization
downregulation and the effect

609
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:40,130
is returned after
the drug is withdrawn

610
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:42,250
for a certain amount
of time, but then

611
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:45,210
the patient can develop
tolerance again.

612
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:52,230
So that's receptor
downregulation

613
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:54,170
with exposure
to an agonist

614
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:55,970
internalization
and degradation.

615
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:03,670
Now, receptor
upregulation can occur

616
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:06,270
in the presence
of an antagonist.

617
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:14,490
So an antagonist now
binds to the receptors

618
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:17,830
and we have here
an example, you see

619
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:20,030
this is an antagonist
here and all these

620
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:22,930
receptors are bound by
the antagonist and the

621
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:25,450
agonist cannot
activate the receptors.

622
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:27,650
Now of course, there
are going to be more

623
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:30,610
than three receptors
on a membrane and there

624
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:33,110
will be certainly
way, way, way more,

625
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:35,390
tens of thousands
more, maybe hundreds of

626
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:38,310
thousands more agonist
molecules in there.

627
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:44,790
But this simple
example really

628
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:47,310
serves to demonstrate
the concept.

629
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:53,390
So the cell responds.
The cell recognizes

630
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:56,530
that its receptors
are nonfunctional

631
00:36:56,530 --> 00:37:02,810
and it responds
by inserting more

632
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:06,470
receptors on the
surface and here we have

633
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:09,450
the agonist binding
to the receptor.

634
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:13,050
Now let's say the drug is

635
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:15,230
withdrawn at this point,

636
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:19,290
we have, let's say
there's another receptor

637
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:21,920
here, we have twice
as many receptors

638
00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:24,350
on the plasma membrane

639
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:27,130
compared to normally.

640
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:29,530
The drug is withdrawn.

641
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:31,150
All this drug goes away.

642
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:35,450
Now the agonist
comes out and it can

643
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:41,110
bind six receptors
instead of three

644
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:45,790
receptors. So the
response is going to

645
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:49,730
be much exaggerated
compared to normal

646
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:52,710
once the antagonist
is withdrawn.

647
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:57,430
So this membrane now
is super sensitive.

648
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:01,270
Now let's say we
have an example

649
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:04,550
again of our beta
blocker blocking

650
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:06,310
our beta receptors
receptors,

651
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:09,070
and more receptors
have been deposited

652
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:12,030
on the cell
membrane because we

653
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:14,190
have that antagonist
present. Now the

654
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:17,890
beta blocker is
abruptly withdrawn.

655
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:19,290
The patient's
been taking it for

656
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:21,790
a long time,
body got used to

657
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:23,630
the beta receptor
being there,

658
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:26,670
and all of a sudden,
in a matter of hours,

659
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:29,970
all of those receptors
are freed up.

660
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:32,630
And what's going to
bind to those receptors?

661
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:36,010
norepinephrine and
epinephrine, and what

662
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:39,110
can happen? The
supersensitive response, the

663
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:44,090
hyper-response increase
in blood pressure,

664
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:48,490
the patient can get a
hypertensive problem.

665
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:57,630
Again I invite you to
pause the computer.

666
00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:00,310
How does receptor
desensitization and

667
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:02,350
downregulation
affect response to a

668
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:05,630
natural or drug
agonist? And, how does

669
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:07,550
receptor
supersensitivity affect

670
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:10,770
response to a natural
or drug agonist?

671
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:13,170
Please pause if you wish.

672
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:21,630
Well, you're back now,
so the answer to the

673
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:24,890
first question is
desensitization and down

674
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:27,470
regulation cause a
diminished response to

675
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:31,570
continuous or repeated
exposure to an agonist

676
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:35,060
that can lead to
fewer receptors or

677
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:38,050
desensitized receptors on
the cell surface. After

678
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:41,070
withdrawal of the drug,
cells recover full

679
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:44,370
responsiveness to a
subsequent addition of

680
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:48,470
the agonist. They
undergo resensitization.

681
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:53,210
Now supersensitivity,
continuous or repeated

682
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:59,750
exposure to an
antagonist can cause

683
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:02,790
upregulation of receptors
and insertion of an

684
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:05,570
increased number of
receptors on cell surfaces.

685
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,590
After the antagonist
is withdrawn, the

686
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:10,850
increased receptor
density can result

687
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:14,090
in an exaggerated
response to a natural

688
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:17,850
or drug agonist,
supersensitivity.

689
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:23,870
And our final topic,
pharmacodynamic

690
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:26,310
variability in
a population.

691
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:29,970
The response to a
drug, the effect,

692
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:32,710
is specified to
be either present

693
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:34,810
or absent in a
given individual.

694
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:38,010
It's an either
or event, which

695
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:40,130
is called a
quantal event.

696
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:43,670
Determining the dose
of a drug required to

697
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:46,190
produce a specified
effect, it has to be

698
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:49,550
specified in advance,
in a large number of

699
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:51,510
individual patients,
as in a clinical

700
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:57,010
trial, or experimental
animal and plotting the

701
00:40:57,010 --> 00:40:59,510
quantal dose response
can be used to

702
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:05,730
generate some information
on the margin of

703
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:09,990
safety to be expected
for a particular drug.

704
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:17,110
To be expected,
remembering that each

705
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:21,690
individual is an
individual. And there can be

706
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:24,870
individual differences
between patients.

707
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:30,550
So we have our
figure here

708
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:32,090
on the right hand side.

709
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:36,050
And we have our
bell curve here.

710
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:40,370
And we have our
cumulative curve here.

711
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:45,690
Now, each of these
individuals is given

712
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:49,670
a dose of a drug
and then observed to

713
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:52,750
see if the pre-specified
response occurs.

714
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:55,870
So we talk about,
let's say, sedation.

715
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:59,530
So the response
we're looking for

716
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:04,470
is sedation. And
at this low dose,

717
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:09,650
a few individuals have
exhibited sedation.

718
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:13,230
And at this dose, a
few more individuals.

719
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:17,190
And at this
dose, 50% of the

720
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:20,490
individuals have
exhibited sedation.

721
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:23,490
And on, and at this dose,

722
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:27,210
finally, all of the
individuals have

723
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:30,170
exhibited sedation. Now
look at this spread.

724
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:33,750
Some individuals
were sedated here,

725
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:36,290
half the individuals were

726
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:39,370
sedated at this
point, the ED50,

727
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:46,370
the dose at which 50% of

728
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:48,010
the individuals
responded,

729
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:53,010
and some of the
individuals did not

730
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:56,030
respond at all until
this high dose.

731
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:03,190
Now, thinking about
an even higher dose

732
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:07,090
that's given, we're
talking about toxicity now.

733
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:10,330
Whatever that endpoint
toxicity is with

734
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:13,390
animal studies, it
might be death, for

735
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:16,430
example. In clinical
trials, trials, it might

736
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:19,080
be the appearance of
a particular toxicity.

737
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:26,350
So if it's death,
this is lethal dose at

738
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:29,610
which 50% of the
individuals had died.

739
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:32,210
And if we're
talking about a

740
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:33,970
clinical trial,
for example,

741
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:38,470
it would be toxic
dose, 50, the point

742
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:41,470
at which 50% of
the individuals

743
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:45,810
demonstrated the pre
-specified toxicity.

744
00:43:48,610 --> 00:43:51,800
Here a few of
the individuals

745
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:54,370
experienced the toxicity.

746
00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:59,790
Here, 50% of the
individuals, or I should

747
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:01,470
say death, that's what
we're talking about

748
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:08,030
here, LD50, of the
individuals had died

749
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:11,640
at this concentration.
And at this

750
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:16,150
concentration, all of
the individuals had died.

751
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:18,150
So you can see there's
a big spread in

752
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:22,150
the concentration
that produced the pre

753
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:25,630
-specified effect in
different individuals.

754
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:33,010
Now what do we, how can

755
00:44:33,010 --> 00:44:34,390
we use this information?

756
00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:36,390
Well the therapeutic
index is an

757
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:38,830
estimate of the safety
of a drug, and I

758
00:44:38,830 --> 00:44:40,630
have another figure
to show you this.

759
00:44:41,330 --> 00:44:44,730
The median effective
dose, the ED50, is

760
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:46,770
the dose of a drug
required to produce

761
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:50,110
a specified effect
in 50% of the

762
00:44:50,110 --> 00:44:58,350
population. So, these
are repeated concepts.

763
00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:02,370
Median lethal
dose, the LD50,

764
00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:04,170
is the dose of
a drug that is

765
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:07,870
lethal in 50% of
the population.

766
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:13,390
Median toxic dose,
the TD50, is the dose

767
00:45:13,390 --> 00:45:15,190
of a drug that
produces a specified

768
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:18,510
toxic effect in 50%
of the population. it.

769
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:26,050
The therapeutic index
relates the dose of

770
00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:30,110
the drug required to
produce the specified

771
00:45:30,110 --> 00:45:34,370
effect to the dose
that produces the

772
00:45:34,370 --> 00:45:36,430
undesired effect. So
it's a relationship

773
00:45:36,430 --> 00:45:44,350
between the the benefit
and the unbenefit,

774
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:48,220
the undesired effect.
LD50 or TD50 are

775
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:50,590
experimentally defined
by the following.

776
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:54,710
Therapeutic index
equals the LD50 divided

777
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:58,790
by the ED50 or the
toxic dose 50 divided

778
00:45:58,790 --> 00:46:02,850
by the ED50. Same
concept. A large

779
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:06,970
therapeutic index
indicates a wide margin. So

780
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:11,830
if the LD50 is here,
and the ED50 is here,

781
00:46:11,830 --> 00:46:15,510
we have this margin
of safety in here.

782
00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:21,210
Now, a small
therapeutic index, say

783
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:27,050
the LD50 is here,
and the ED50 is here,

784
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:29,890
compared Compared to
that other one, we

785
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:35,310
see we only have a
narrow range of safety.

786
00:46:40,690 --> 00:46:43,050
And this range of
safety is referred

787
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:45,690
to as the
therapeutic window.

788
00:46:47,350 --> 00:46:49,810
Looking at our
cumulative curves

789
00:46:49,810 --> 00:46:56,950
again, here's our
ED50, 50% of the

790
00:46:56,950 --> 00:47:00,390
individuals have
already already achieved

791
00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:03,630
that desired
beneficial effect.

792
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:08,030
The rest of them
will achieve it

793
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:11,030
somewhere in this
therapeutic window,

794
00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:15,530
but a few of them
will actually

795
00:47:15,530 --> 00:47:19,170
be above the
therapeutic window,

796
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:23,490
and we see that this
is actually a dose

797
00:47:23,490 --> 00:47:25,890
for some that's in
the toxic range.

798
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:34,210
Here, some individuals
will have already

799
00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:38,470
experienced the toxic
effect or even died

800
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:41,090
even though the
concentrations in the

801
00:47:41,090 --> 00:47:44,550
therapeutic window. Some
individuals are just

802
00:47:44,550 --> 00:47:47,910
more sensitive relative
to the drug effect.

803
00:47:50,670 --> 00:47:53,630
The therapeutic window
represents the range

804
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:56,190
of steady state
concentrations at which

805
00:47:56,190 --> 00:47:59,210
the likelihood of
efficacy is high and

806
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:02,210
the probability of
adverse effects is low.

807
00:48:02,450 --> 00:48:07,670
So it's just a
starting point.

808
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:11,710
This range does not
guarantee safety

809
00:48:11,710 --> 00:48:14,950
or efficacy in
individual patients.

810
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:20,790
And in fact,
it wasn't even

811
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:22,670
efficacious in
these patients.

812
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:30,680
What is the clinical
value of the

813
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:33,380
therapeutic index and
the therapeutic window?

814
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:35,940
I think you can
answer this even

815
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:39,160
without pausing your
computer. But you, if

816
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:41,700
you wish to, certainly
think about it.

817
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:46,920
The therapeutic
index relates the

818
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:48,680
dose of a drug
required to produce

819
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:50,220
a desired effect
to the dose

820
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:52,440
that produces an
undesired effect.

821
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:55,700
It is an estimate,
estimate.

822
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,760
The therapeutic
window is the dose

823
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,860
range of a drug that
provides safe and

824
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:04,560
effective therapy
with minimal adverse

825
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:07,920
effects. It does
not guarantee safety

826
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:11,080
or efficacy in the
individual patient.

827
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:16,840
Optimize therapy for

828
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:20,380
the individual patient.

829
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:23,120
So how do you do
this? You have

830
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:26,510
to take a very good,
careful history

831
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:29,720
and that will
help guide you.

832
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:37,580
So in summary,
we have our

833
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,920
pharmacodynamics
is the study of the

834
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:42,040
effects on the
biologic systems.

835
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:46,960
We have our two-state
receptor occupancy

836
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,820
model that postulates
that receptors

837
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:51,740
in the receptor pool
exist in equilibrium

838
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:54,620
in two interchangeable
conformational

839
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:56,480
states in the
absence of a ligand.

840
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:59,620
Remember this is one
type of receptor.

841
00:50:00,190 --> 00:50:02,380
The active
conformation and

842
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:03,800
the inactive
conformation.

843
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:06,320
Full agonists,
partial agonists,

844
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:08,640
neutral antagonists,
and inverse

845
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:11,720
agonists are explained
by this model.

846
00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:15,865
Many drugs actually
do represent

847
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:19,120
this model, but
many drugs do not.

848
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:23,900
The classical receptor
occupancy model

849
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:26,280
postulates that
receptors are quiescent,

850
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:29,700
quiet, unless
activated by a ligand.

851
00:50:30,330 --> 00:50:34,160
Agonists occupy
receptors, activate

852
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,460
their regulatory
effector mechanisms,

853
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:38,500
and produce a
response. Agonists

854
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:40,860
have affinity and
intrinsic activity.

855
00:50:41,950 --> 00:50:44,780
Antagonists occupy
receptors, but do not

856
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:48,080
activate them, they
have affinity, zero

857
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:50,640
intrinsic allergic
activity and prevent the

858
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:53,240
agonist from occupying
the site of action.

859
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:56,660
Receptor antagonists
are classified as

860
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:59,260
competitive and
noncompetitive antagonists,

861
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:02,600
irreversible, and
allosteric modulators.

862
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:06,740
Positive allosteric
modulators increase

863
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:10,500
agonist affinity or
magnitude of effect.

864
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:13,620
But negative allosteric
modulators reduce

865
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:18,620
affinity and or
efficacy of the agonist.

866
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,340
Physiologic or
functional antagonism

867
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:27,750
results from
counterbalancing effects

868
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:38,180
on physiologic
regulatory pathways

869
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:41,060
by substances
acting at different

870
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:44,760
receptors or by
different mechanisms.

871
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:54,180
Chemical antagonists
sequester the agonist,

872
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:56,700
preventing it from
binding its receptors.

873
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:00,160
Cellular regulation
of drug receptor

874
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,720
interactions
can alter the

875
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,880
response to the
agonist over time.

876
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,280
Diminished
responsiveness, which is

877
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:10,400
tolerance,
tachyphylaxis, due to

878
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,320
continuous or repeated
repeated exposure

879
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:14,540
to an agonist
results in receptor

880
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:17,620
desensitization
and downregulation.

881
00:52:18,130 --> 00:52:20,420
After withdrawal
of the agonist, the

882
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:22,500
cells recover full
responsiveness

883
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:26,180
to a subsequent
addition of agonist,

884
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:27,620
and this is called
resensitization.

885
00:52:29,310 --> 00:52:31,580
An increased
density of membrane

886
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:36,280
receptors can result
from continuous

887
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:39,020
or repeated exposure
to an antagonist

888
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:41,160
after the antagonist
is withdrawn.

889
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:44,240
Activation by
the agonist can

890
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:47,220
cause an exaggerated
response.

891
00:52:49,210 --> 00:52:51,720
Individuals in a
population vary in their

892
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:53,960
response to the same
concentration of a

893
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:57,460
single drug or similar
drugs, and a given

894
00:52:57,460 --> 00:53:00,480
individual may not
always respond in the

895
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,520
same way to the same
drug concentration.

896
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:07,020
Quantal dose response
curves describes

897
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:10,640
the cumulative frequency
distributions of

898
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:13,800
responders defined
as an all or none

899
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:16,740
effect plotted against
the log dose of a

900
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:19,860
drug. The percentage
of the population

901
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:23,780
affected increases as
the dose is raised.

902
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:26,660
The parameters for
calculating the therapeutic

903
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:29,180
index are the dose
of drug required

904
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:32,780
to produce an effect in
50% of the population,

905
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:35,580
ED50, and the
dose that produces

906
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:39,620
death or toxicity in
50% of the population.

907
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:43,380
The therapeutic
index is an

908
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:46,980
estimate, that's
all it is, an

909
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:49,860
estimate of the
drug's safety.

910
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:55,450
The therapeutic
window is a range of

911
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:58,040
steady state
concentrations at which the

912
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:01,740
likelihood hood of
efficacy is high and the

913
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:05,260
probability of adverse
effects is low.

914
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:12,040
And that concludes
this lecture,

915
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,380
the series on
pharmacodynamics.
