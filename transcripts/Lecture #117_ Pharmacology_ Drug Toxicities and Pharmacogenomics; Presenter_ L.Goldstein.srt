00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,400
Welcome students to
pharmacology. In this

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,640
lecture we'll be talking
about the mechanisms

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,680
of how therapeutic
drugs can cause toxicity

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:13,260
and we'll also describe
pharmacogenomics,

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:16,500
which is a study of how
genes affect a person's

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,540
response to drugs. Dr.
Goldstein speaking.

7
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:26,110
Please contact
me if you'd

8
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:28,010
like to talk
pharmacology.

9
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:32,610
Famously,

10
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:36,610
Paracelsus said many
hundreds of years

11
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:40,050
ago, all things are
poison, for there

12
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,330
is nothing without
poisonous qualities.

13
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,810
Only the dose permits

14
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:46,610
something not
to be poisonous.

15
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:50,950
This is a fundamental
concept that we have

16
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:53,190
been talking about
since the beginning.

17
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:00,210
Here are the
learning objectives,

18
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:03,250
mechanisms, mechanisms,

19
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:10,170
mechanisms, some
suggestions for studying,

20
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:13,830
some links if you'd
like to access

21
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:19,390
these resources
and terminology.

22
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:24,090
Absolutely essential
to have your

23
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,650
terminology become
second nature to you,

24
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:31,070
which only happens
by using it, using

25
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:33,460
it over and over and
over, using it in

26
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,950
conversation with
people who will

27
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:39,350
understand the language
of medicine. I'll

28
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:47,950
give you many
examples to illustrate

29
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:51,650
the points that I
making to show you

30
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:56,650
different mechanisms
of these various

31
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:01,470
toxicities in a
clinical context.

32
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:05,270
So in addition to
learning the terminology,

33
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:08,150
please be able to
recognize, explain

34
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:13,130
in your own words
out loud to someone

35
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:16,090
who understands the
language of medicine

36
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,490
to people who do
not understand the

37
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:20,370
language of medicine.
Say it in lay

38
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:24,550
terms and apply the
following concepts.

39
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,570
The types of adverse
drug reactions,

40
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:32,690
the risk factors and
causes, toxic effects,

41
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:35,690
harmful effects on
cells and organs,

42
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:38,610
therapeutic use and
pregnancy, harmful

43
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:41,690
effects of maternal
drug use on the

44
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:45,170
fetus and the neonate,
mechanisms and

45
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:48,050
causes of immunologic
adverse events,

46
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:53,230
pharmacogenomic
principles, and I

47
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:57,550
put stars on certain
items that I expect

48
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,110
you to memorize
because they

49
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:04,130
absolutely could
appear on an NYIT-COM

50
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:07,930
exam or possibly
even a board exam.

51
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:13,030
So let us begin
with basic concepts.

52
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:17,190
Risk factors are
many for adverse

53
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,450
drug reactions,
and they are

54
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:24,330
given here in this
simple mind map.

55
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:28,110
These, you can
recognize, are individual

56
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:32,930
patient risk factors
that can increase

57
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:37,090
their exposure to
adverse drug events.

58
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:44,590
They're classified as
common and predictable

59
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:47,890
or rare and mostly
unpredictable.

60
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:50,870
So common and
predictable. I'm sure you

61
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:54,480
know these intuitively.
An overdose or

62
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:59,530
possibly even an abrupt
dose reduction in

63
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:03,110
which the disease
problem can reappear.

64
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,090
Side effects. The
usual things like

65
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:09,850
dry mouth, nausea,
sleepiness, so many

66
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:12,570
drugs, all drugs
in fact, have side

67
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:17,410
effects that are
annoying, uncomfortable,

68
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,970
but not necessarily
serious.

69
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:23,190
Abrupt drug withdrawal.

70
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:24,830
A patient's been taking a

71
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,610
drug chronically
over time.

72
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:31,130
And many drugs need
to be gradually

73
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:33,930
tapered. The dose needs
to be tapered down

74
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:37,910
before the drug is
withdrawn. Otherwise,

75
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:42,310
the patient can
develop symptoms of the

76
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:45,430
original problem that
was being treated.

77
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:50,290
And these can be
large symptoms.

78
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:54,370
Secondary effects.
And the greatest

79
00:04:54,370 --> 00:05:00,510
example of this is
antibiotic use that

80
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:03,750
predisposes a patient
to a superinfection,

81
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,590
an infection from an
organism that is not

82
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:09,050
going to be killed
by the antibiotic.

83
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:15,470
There are patients
who are resistant to

84
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:19,390
the drug effects or
paradoxical effects

85
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:23,110
can occur. So effects
that seem opposite of

86
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:25,020
what should happen,
that's paradoxical.

87
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,990
And of course,
drug interactions,

88
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:30,070
in red, in
larger letters.

89
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:34,110
Now the rare and mostly
unpredictable adverse

90
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:38,590
drug effects are an
exaggerated sensitivity.

91
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:43,230
A patient might
exhibit adverse drug

92
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:47,690
effects to a typical
dose that other people

93
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:51,970
tolerate really well.
or an idiosyncrasy.

94
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:57,190
This is a surprise
effect that is not

95
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:01,230
predictable and is not
attributed to the known

96
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,670
pharmacologic properties.
It's not related

97
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:06,730
to the mechanism of
the drug action or

98
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:09,390
even the mechanism of
the drug side effects.

99
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:12,810
Usually it's
an immunologic

100
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:14,930
reaction, so an allergy.

101
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:19,050
Allergies may be
predictable if the patients

102
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,970
had the allergic
reaction in the past.

103
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:24,850
They could have the
allergic reaction again

104
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:27,810
and again so that's a
predictable allergy.

105
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:33,190
And possibly these are

106
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,930
related at the
gene level.

107
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:39,710
The mechanisms are
frequently not known.

108
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:48,370
Adverse drug
reactions, ADRs,

109
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:50,430
are unwanted,
uncomfortable, or

110
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,610
dangerous effects
of the drugs.

111
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:59,110
Adverse drug events,
ADEs, are injuries

112
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:04,050
directly resulting from
the medication use.

113
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:06,290
They can be physical
harm, mental harm,

114
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:07,710
loss of function.

115
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:09,390
It's an event.

116
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:13,670
High-risk populations.
Older persons

117
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,530
are generally
at the top of

118
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:18,630
the list of high
risk many things.

119
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:23,110
Medication toxicity
is a major cause

120
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:26,090
of hospitalization
in older patients.

121
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:30,090
Of interest, adverse
drug events cause

122
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:34,610
approximately 1.3 million
emergency department

123
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:40,470
visits each year. This
is data from 2017.

124
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:44,510
About 350,000 of
those patients need

125
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,930
to be hospitalized
for further treatment.

126
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:51,500
So this is not
a small problem.

127
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:57,310
And what's really
important is that these

128
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,310
adverse drug events
are potentially

129
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:06,870
preventable because
they are predictable.

130
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:10,110
Okay, what do we see?

131
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:15,270
Older patients
generally have

132
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:17,750
multiple comorbidities,
so a number of

133
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,410
things they're
being treated for.

134
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,910
Polypharmacy, so
they're using multiple

135
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:26,070
drugs, and on top
of it, they're often

136
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:30,930
using OTC products,
herbal products, so

137
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:33,090
it's very important
to specifically ask

138
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:35,590
patients so they can
be put into their

139
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:38,990
history. And then a
prescribing cascade.

140
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:42,970
This happens when an
adverse drug effect

141
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:45,850
is misinterpreted
as a new medical

142
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:50,390
condition, leading to
another prescription.

143
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:54,550
Pregnant individuals,
certain drugs

144
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,610
may be harmful to
the fetus and the

145
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:59,910
neonate. And infants
and young children.

146
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,290
Infants particularly have

147
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:05,130
immature metabolic
processes,

148
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:08,110
and these generally
mature rather

149
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:11,490
quickly, but not
all of them. So

150
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:13,450
there are differences
in age-dependent

151
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:15,430
development of
organ function,

152
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:18,230
and something
very important

153
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:20,950
with pediatric
patients is the

154
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:22,870
potential for
dosing errors.

155
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:30,770
and then children will
put lots of little

156
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:33,730
lots of things in their
mouths and they can

157
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:37,190
take accidentally
take pills especially

158
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:41,570
if the medications
or if it's a solution

159
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:46,090
looks like candy or
something good to drink

160
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:55,890
more categorizations
of these various

161
00:09:55,890 --> 00:10:00,250
drug toxicities So
they're typically

162
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:04,150
predictable. I've said
that three or four times

163
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:06,530
now and I will say
it many more times.

164
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:09,490
How are they
predictable? They're

165
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:12,170
based on knowledge.
Knowledge of the

166
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:14,890
mechanisms,
mechanisms, mechanisms.

167
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:18,410
Mechanisms of action,

168
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,410
mechanisms of
adverse effects.

169
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:23,870
Knowledge of where
they distribute to.

170
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:29,770
knowledge of the dose
response relationship

171
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:34,650
predictable based
on knowledge.

172
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:39,010
Dose dependent means
they're related to

173
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:40,810
the concentration
of drug in the body

174
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:44,580
and to the duration
of the exposure so

175
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,570
some drugs it's
small doses are taken

176
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:51,150
only one or two
times may not produce

177
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,750
the adverse effect
but taken and over

178
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,210
time, or in higher
drug concentrations,

179
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:58,370
we begin to see those
adverse effects.

180
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:03,950
We have them divided
in this illustration

181
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:07,630
to intended tissue,
in other words,

182
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,690
where is the therapeutic
effect supposed

183
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:13,070
to occur, and the
unintended tissue.

184
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:18,450
These adverse effects
can be on target,

185
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:24,250
target or off target.

186
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:30,130
On target results from
the drug interacting

187
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:34,950
with its therapeutic
target and

188
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:38,650
that target may be in
a particular tissue

189
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:43,110
or it can also be
in tissues where

190
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:46,570
we're not looking for
therapeutic effect

191
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:48,680
and that can cause
an adverse effect.

192
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:53,290
So let's look at on
target adverse effects.

193
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:56,810
The dose is too high
or there's chronic

194
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:59,790
activation or inhibition
of the effects.

195
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:04,090
Other on target effects
but in unintended

196
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:07,990
tissue is the
correct receptor but

197
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:12,910
not the right
tissue. So let's say,

198
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:17,250
well I'll give you
examples correct receptor

199
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,790
I did that one the
dose is too high

200
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:24,630
and a chronic activation
or inhibition of

201
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:29,250
effects both intended
and unintended

202
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:36,650
tissues now off target
it's the incorrect

203
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:41,050
receptor that's activated
or inhibited off

204
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:44,270
target in unintended
tissue is the incorrect

205
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:47,210
receptor is activated
or inhibited.

206
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:50,750
So that can
occur in the same

207
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,910
target tissue or
somewhere else.

208
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:00,670
Toxic effects
may be acute,

209
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:04,270
happening right
away. They may be

210
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:07,230
delayed or they
may be cumulative.

211
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:14,370
They as applying
a topical product

212
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:18,310
and getting a reaction
to that topic.

213
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:21,530
Another example of
a local reaction

214
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:24,550
is taking an oral
medication that

215
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:27,010
actually causes
stomach irritation

216
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:29,330
and ulcers. That's
a local reaction.

217
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:32,730
Systemic reactions
that occur after the

218
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:35,210
blood achieves systemic
concentrations.

219
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:38,210
Immunologic reactions or

220
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:40,310
immunogenic reactions.

221
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:43,550
Hypersensitivity,
that's allergy.

222
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:45,530
Mechanism-related immune

223
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:47,310
system upregulation.

224
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:51,510
So this is actually
a therapeutic

225
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:54,190
effect. This is
the point of the

226
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:56,970
drug to upregulate
the immune system

227
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:01,670
to attack cancer,
tumor cells.

228
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:07,750
But the upregulation
of the immune

229
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,910
system can also
attack our host

230
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,730
tissues that are
not diseased.

231
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,250
Photosensitivity,
it's what it sounds

232
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:18,610
like. Exposure to
sunlight. Fetal toxicity.

233
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:22,490
Exposure of the
fetus to toxic drugs.

234
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:28,810
now in terms of the
levels the cellular

235
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:33,690
level apoptosis
necrosis DNA damage

236
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:36,990
mutagenesis where
there is just a change

237
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:39,570
in the gene that can
give rise to altered

238
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:42,510
proteins carcinogenesis
mutations that

239
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:46,050
give rise to cancer
and organ toxicities

240
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:49,090
I put four here there
are more forfeit

241
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:52,790
here and these are
very common. So

242
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:55,190
liver, kidney, nerves,
and bone toxicity.

243
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:57,770
Bone marrow
toxicity, sorry.

244
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:00,350
Bone marrow
toxicity, we think

245
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:05,270
of low levels
of blood cells.

246
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:07,030
Red blood cells, white

247
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,530
blood cells,
and platelets.

248
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:15,710
On the left upper,
we see an apoptotic

249
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:17,810
cell, a white blood
cell that's undergoing

250
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:20,370
apoptosis. The
important point here

251
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:24,470
is that these membrane
-covered particles

252
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:27,410
are blimbing off
of the white blood

253
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:30,510
cell as it's dying,
and because they

254
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:33,510
are membrane-covered,
they're not going

255
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:36,350
to be toxic to the
neighboring cells.

256
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:40,650
Compare that to this
necrotic cell that

257
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:44,870
is just bursting
and it's dumping its

258
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:49,730
contents into the
local environment. DNA

259
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:54,030
damage, it can be
either DNA breaks, and

260
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:58,220
that is a goal of many
chemotherapeutics,

261
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:01,190
or it could just
be changes in the

262
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:05,750
sequence of the amino
acids, and that will

263
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:11,790
give rise to a
functional, an aberrant

264
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:14,230
functional protein
or a non-functional

265
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:21,650
protein, and here are
some histo pictures.

266
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:24,790
On the left
-hand inside we

267
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:27,830
see granulomatous
hepatitis.

268
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:31,930
In the middle, it's an
interstitial nephritis.

269
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:35,290
I've marked, I've
given you these

270
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:39,250
arrows, red arrows and
stars to show what they're

271
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,650
referring to in the
legend underneath.

272
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:48,090
And here is a CT, a
chest CT of a patient

273
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:51,510
receiving an anti
-cancer drug that's

274
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:55,330
called erlotinib,
and this erlotinib is

275
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:57,710
actually causing this
pulmonary toxicity.

276
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:07,450
Peripheral neuropathy
is a common adverse

277
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:11,690
effect of chemotherapeutics.
Other drugs can

278
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:15,320
cause it too. You don't
have to memorize this

279
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:17,970
scheme here. It's just
pointing out different

280
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:23,690
locations on neurons
where neurotoxicity

281
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:27,440
can occur and lead to
peripheral neuropathy.

282
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,750
Photosensitivity,
drug-induced

283
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:36,790
photosensitivity
is categorized as

284
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:39,430
phototoxicity
or photoallergy.

285
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:44,270
So phototoxicity is
actually the drug

286
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:52,150
producing products
that can absorb

287
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:54,770
the UV radiation And
that can actually

288
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:56,950
directly cause
cellular damage that

289
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:00,570
looks like this
terrible sunburn.

290
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,770
And photoallergy, you

291
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:05,290
can see these welts here.

292
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,690
You can tell it's a

293
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:09,450
hypersensitivity
reaction.

294
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:17,170
So here's some check
your knowledge.

295
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,950
I suggest you
pause the video and

296
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:22,770
see if you can
remember the answers.

297
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:29,250
so for those of you
who have paused let's

298
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:33,090
come back now what
are the causes of

299
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:35,350
the common and predictable
adverse effects

300
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:37,850
what is the meaning
of on target and

301
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:41,150
off target effects
what cellular and organ

302
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:43,990
damage can occur
as a result of drug

303
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:49,070
-induced adverse effects
so for the answers

304
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:51,150
I suggest you look
back at the slides.

305
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:57,230
Let's talk about the
use of therapeutic

306
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:00,730
drugs during pregnancy.
The therapeutic

307
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:03,170
benefit of
medication use in the

308
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:05,690
expectant mother
must be weighed

309
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:09,290
against the potential
adverse effects on

310
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:13,110
fetal growth and
fetal development.

311
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:17,810
Health risks and
benefits of drug therapy

312
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:21,390
to both mother and fetus
must be considered.

313
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:24,510
The vast majority
of drugs are

314
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:26,850
not recommended
during pregnancy.

315
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:29,570
Pregnant
individuals are not

316
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:32,410
included in
clinical trials.

317
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:40,310
So the information
we gather is the use

318
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:43,970
of prescribed drugs,
of FDA-approved drugs,

319
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:47,770
in individuals who
are in a pregnancy

320
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:52,190
registry so that we can
follow the pregnancy,

321
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:54,730
follow the effect
on the fetus, follow

322
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:56,930
the effect on the
neonate. In other

323
00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:01,890
words, gather data. all
prescribers have the

324
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:04,670
responsibility of
educating pregnant

325
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:07,650
patients not to
take any medications

326
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:11,570
prescription over-the
-counter or recreational

327
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:15,430
during pregnancy
consult a pharmacist

328
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:20,190
pharmacist can be very
helpful here and the

329
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:23,230
obstetrician before
taking any medication

330
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:30,430
the pregnancy and
lactation labeling

331
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:32,630
rule is really a
very convenient

332
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:37,920
very helpful way of
guiding prescribers

333
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:43,750
on the recommendations
the data

334
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:47,390
and the recommendations
for all drugs

335
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:50,030
FDA-approved drugs.

336
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:54,870
They include
information about

337
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:57,050
pregnancy during
labor and delivery,

338
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:00,030
pregnancy
including labor and

339
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:03,490
delivery, about
breastfeeding, and

340
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:06,170
about prior to
becoming pregnant.

341
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:10,250
All of these words can be

342
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,810
broken down into
a few ideas.

343
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:18,990
Data, data risk summary
based on the data

344
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:33,170
and management data
risk management that's

345
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:39,010
it data risk management
the great thing

346
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:41,530
about the pregnancy
and lactation labeling

347
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:43,490
rule especially
compared to the way it

348
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:46,610
was previously done,
which was with letters

349
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:52,440
A, B, C, D, and X,
is the management

350
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:57,770
recommendations based
on the data and risk.

351
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:01,330
Lactation is
the same thing.

352
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:02,810
Data,

353
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:05,330
risk, and clinical

354
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:08,470
considerations
for the fetus.

355
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:11,490
Now, reproductive
considerations

356
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:13,650
for females
and males. This

357
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:15,890
is prior to
becoming pregnant.

358
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:19,650
So there are recommendations
about pregnancy

359
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:23,210
testing before
giving drug therapy.

360
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:25,850
Should the patient be
tested prior to it?

361
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:28,490
Is it not necessary?
That sort of thing.

362
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:30,810
Certain drugs,

363
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:34,170
patients taking
certain drugs should

364
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:36,270
not become pregnant
while they're taking

365
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:39,370
those drugs. So
there's contraceptive

366
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:44,030
advice regarding
when appropriate.

367
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:48,690
And certain males
can pass on drugs

368
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:53,230
through ***** to
a female who may

369
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:55,430
become pregnant or
who is pregnant.

370
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:59,630
So that information is
also included in the

371
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:02,210
pregnancy and lactation
labeling rule.

372
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:09,490
Please have a general
sense of the utility of

373
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:13,730
this information for
the pregnant patient or

374
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:16,910
the patient intending
to become pregnant.

375
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,530
You don't have
to memorize these

376
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:22,310
words. Just get
the main idea.

377
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:29,470
Now, a teratogen is a
drug that exerts its

378
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:32,470
effects on target
organs at a particular

379
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:36,430
stage of fetal development
during the limited

380
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:41,350
time of organogenesis
of the target organ.

381
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:46,490
This little chart shows
the time frames of

382
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:49,610
organ development
during the embryonic

383
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:52,550
period. You don't have
to memorize this, it's

384
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:54,950
just kind of interesting
to get an idea of

385
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:59,450
when the various organs
are in development.

386
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:04,290
So that's
teratogenesis, when

387
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:07,370
it exerts its
effect at particular

388
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:09,750
stages in organogenesis.

389
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:15,810
Fetotoxicity is
basically any

390
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:18,090
injury to the
fetus at any time.

391
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:21,550
Injury to the fetus
from a substance

392
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:23,710
that enters the
maternal and placental

393
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:27,090
circulation which
may cause fetal

394
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:30,470
malformations, altered
growths, or in utero

395
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:35,190
death. So it's a
broad basket term.

396
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:37,410
Teratogenicity
we talked about,

397
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:40,630
and a teratogen
is any agent

398
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:43,970
that will cause
teratogenicity.

399
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:46,750
Now, let's not
forget the neonate.

400
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:48,730
So,

401
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:55,310
when mothers take drugs

402
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:59,590
like alcohol and opioids,

403
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:02,430
benzodiazepine,
barbiturates,

404
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:06,210
certain other drugs
chronically that can

405
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:13,350
have an effect of opiate
use, I mean opiate.

406
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:18,110
well how do I say this
that can be addictive

407
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:22,750
then chronically
the babies also take

408
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,430
that in and then
when they're born

409
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:28,530
there's an abrupt
withdrawal now of this drug

410
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:30,190
because they're not
receiving it in the

411
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:33,230
mother's circulation
anymore so they

412
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:38,450
can develop neonatal
abstinence syndrome.

413
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:42,790
And of course other
effects include

414
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:44,850
********* births,
low birth weight,

415
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:47,190
heart defects,
other birth defects.

416
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:52,470
The picture of neonatal

417
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:54,050
abstinence syndrome,

418
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:57,010
drug withdrawal
syndrome that follows

419
00:25:57,010 --> 00:25:59,810
in utero exposure
to maternal opioids,

420
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:02,450
alcohol, benzodiazepines,
barbiturates.

421
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:08,890
And I especially
like the picture

422
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:11,690
of this poor child
who looks like

423
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:13,410
it's suffering from
this withdrawal.

424
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:17,450
So this needs to
be treated and the

425
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:19,470
neonatologist knows
how to do that.

426
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:24,250
All right, test
your knowledge.

427
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:27,950
What information is
provided in the pregnancy

428
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:30,170
and lactation labeling
rule that can be

429
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:33,490
helpful to clinicians
in educating pregnant

430
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:35,830
patients and individuals
with reproductive

431
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:39,330
potential about drug
use during pregnancy.

432
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:43,150
So I invite you
to pause the video

433
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:45,230
and have a thought
about this.

434
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:51,250
And here are the
answers. The labeling

435
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:53,410
of each drug should
include collection

436
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:54,930
of data through
pregnancy registry

437
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:57,830
data about the
potential risks of

438
00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:00,370
medication during
pregnancy, the risk summary,

439
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:02,550
and clinical
considerations for

440
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,610
use during pregnancy
and breastfeeding.

441
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:07,750
Breastfeeding risk
data about the timing

442
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:11,370
of breastfeeding,
excretion of drug in breast

443
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:14,250
milk, and the risk
to the infants are

444
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:17,350
provided along with
clinical considerations.

445
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:20,790
Reproductive
considerations for females

446
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:22,630
and males include
pregnancy testing

447
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:25,310
recommendations before
beginning drug therapy,

448
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:28,250
contraception advice,
and information

449
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:31,070
about infertility
for males who wish

450
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:33,510
to father a child.
I forgot to include

451
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:35,510
that when I was talking
about it before,

452
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:38,570
but certainly that
is a consideration.

453
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:45,070
Drug immune system
interactions.

454
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:47,910
In other words,
hypersensitivity reactions.

455
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:51,990
A drug may act as an
antigen and elicit

456
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:55,590
a hypersensitivity
response. A drug may

457
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:58,150
interact with immune
receptors and lead

458
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:01,210
to activation of
specific immune cells.

459
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:05,230
Drugs can induce
all types of immune

460
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:08,830
-mediated
hypersensitivity or

461
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:11,590
allergic reactions
that can cause

462
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:15,610
significant morbidity
and lead to death.

463
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:19,890
and you may recall
that I mentioned in

464
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:23,790
the beginning that
these may be predictable

465
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:27,710
so we need to take
a good history about

466
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:31,290
the potential about
the person's past

467
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:34,250
hypersensitivity
reactions or they may

468
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:38,330
be unpredictable in
which case the patient

469
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:41,430
has taken it safely
before and now this

470
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:44,410
time has a
hypersensitivity reaction.

471
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:50,510
Mechanisms. Mechanisms.

472
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:51,830
Mechanisms. Haptans.

473
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:58,470
Small molecules
normally are unable

474
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:01,750
to elicit an
immune response.

475
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:04,040
They are not
immunogenic. However,

476
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:07,310
these small molecules,
either they're

477
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:09,370
drugs or the metabolites
of the drugs,

478
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:13,190
that are not reactive
normally become

479
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:18,030
immunogenic by
covalently binding to

480
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:22,330
host proteins on
cells or plasma, and

481
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:28,590
that's called hapten
carrier complex.

482
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:32,290
Now, these hapten
peptide fragments are

483
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:38,450
presented by antigen
-presenting cells to the T

484
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:43,610
-cells, hence an allergic
reaction can occur.

485
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:48,470
Biologic drugs, these
are proteins. When

486
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:50,210
you see that word,
biologic drugs,

487
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:53,310
according to the
terminology at this point,

488
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,370
that means they're
made out of proteins.

489
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:59,240
So protein drugs,
such as monoclonal

490
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,310
antibodies, there are
other types of protein

491
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:05,830
drugs, can preferentially
stimulate antibody

492
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:08,110
responses and some
T-cell responses.

493
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:10,970
So whenever we're
giving a monoclonal

494
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:13,010
antibody drug,
whether it's

495
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:14,870
the first time or
subsequent times,

496
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:19,450
the staff must
be prepared to

497
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:22,230
manage any type of
hypersensitivity

498
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:23,810
reaction that can occur.

499
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:28,230
And drug-induced
autoimmunity.

500
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:30,810
This is, in other words,

501
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:34,630
autoimmunity is when the

502
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:37,730
antibodies attack
the host cells.

503
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:41,910
So an autoimmune
phenomenon where the

504
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:43,950
patient develops
symptoms similar

505
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:47,030
to an autoimmune
disease. And lupus

506
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:50,510
-like disorder always
jumps up first.

507
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:56,650
Systemic lupus
erythematosus is an

508
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:59,290
autoimmune disorder.
and some drugs

509
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:02,810
can actually cause
a hypersensitivity

510
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:05,650
reaction that
resembles lupus.

511
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:09,370
And I mentioned
a couple more.

512
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:12,270
Most drugs are small
molecular weight

513
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:14,310
compounds with simple
chemical structures

514
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:16,410
which are not
easily recognized by

515
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:19,210
immune cells and too
small to interact

516
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,590
with immune
receptors with enough

517
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:25,030
strength to activate
T and B cells. That's

518
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:27,230
when we think about
hapten formation.

519
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:33,650
This is the Jalen
-Koombs classification.

520
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:37,330
You may have
received this lecture

521
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:40,190
already. If not, you
will be receiving it.

522
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:46,190
We talk about drug
therapies and allergic

523
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:48,670
reactions,
hypersensitivity reactions,

524
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:52,930
with each and every
drug. This is a

525
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:55,870
must-know concept.
I'm not going to go

526
00:31:55,870 --> 00:32:01,110
over it here, but you
should learn about

527
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:05,810
this when, hopefully,
in this term.

528
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:12,290
So test your knowledge.
Small chemicals are

529
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:14,670
not easily recognized
by the immune cells

530
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:16,530
and too small to
interact with immune

531
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:19,610
receptors with enough
strength to activate T

532
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:23,150
and B cells. How do
these drugs or their drug

533
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:26,230
metabolites elicit
an allergic reaction?

534
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,110
Okay, say it out loud.

535
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:30,210
I'll give you a moment.

536
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:36,030
Small molecules
may induce a

537
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:39,010
hypersensitivity reaction
by covalent binding

538
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:43,550
to host proteins on
cells or in plasma

539
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:47,190
forming a hapten
carrier complex.

540
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:52,750
These haptenpeptide
fragments are presented

541
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:56,230
by antigen-presenting
cells, two T-cells,

542
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:59,630
ultimately eliciting
an allergic reaction.

543
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:05,850
Let's shift now over
to pharmacogenomics.

544
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:09,210
Pharmacogenomics
is defined as the

545
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:11,590
systematic
examination of genes,

546
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:14,950
gene products,
and variation in

547
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:16,630
gene expression
and function.

548
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:19,690
There are tools
to do this.

549
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:23,510
Pharmacogenomics
researchers evaluate

550
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:27,310
multigenic determinants
of drug response.

551
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:29,890
So you know it's
about drugs because

552
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:31,970
it's got the word
pharmaco in it,

553
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:34,170
and you know it's
about genomics because

554
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:36,110
it's got the word
genomics in it.

555
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,890
So this is drug
response in an

556
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:43,210
individual or
across a population.

557
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:47,570
Pharmacogenetics
is frequently used

558
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,850
interchangeably.
It is the effect

559
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:52,870
of a person's
genetic factors on

560
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:54,950
that person's
response to the drugs.

561
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:58,330
And precision,
or personalized

562
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:01,890
medicine, this is
becoming a very

563
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:07,290
important aspect
of clinical care.

564
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:11,550
So, in other words,
being able to select

565
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:15,530
the appropriate
drug for the right

566
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:19,950
patient and to avoid
drugs that would

567
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:24,870
cause an adverse
effect in a patient and

568
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:28,710
based on their
pharmacogenetic makeup.

569
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:36,230
And this little
figure shows all the

570
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:38,370
different ways that
we can think about it.

571
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:44,270
Single nucleotide
polymorphism simply means

572
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:52,970
that there is a change
in the sequence.

573
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:57,710
So whereas here
is a sequence,

574
00:34:57,710 --> 00:35:00,590
there's one change
in each of these

575
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:03,030
other individuals,
and that can cause

576
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:06,530
an important
variation that will

577
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:08,890
affect their response
to drug therapy.

578
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:15,810
most of these variants
don't affect how

579
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:19,740
people respond to a
drug but some do and

580
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:22,270
there are screening
tests to help us

581
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:26,090
identify the patients
who might be at risk

582
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:32,960
how do we look at these
poor metabolizers,

583
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:35,010
intermediate
metabolizers, extensive

584
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:37,990
metabolizers, ultra
-rapid metabolizers.

585
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:42,970
So poor metabolizers
means that they're not

586
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:45,740
metabolizing as well
as other people and

587
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:49,570
if a drug is not
being metabolized then

588
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:52,930
there will be higher
blood levels and higher

589
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:56,530
blood levels for a
given dose can mean an

590
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:59,330
increased risk of
adverse drug effects,

591
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:02,150
adverse drug events. So
how does this happen?

592
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:05,870
Poor metabolizers
have two alleles

593
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:08,750
encoding a non
-functional protein.

594
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:13,190
So either the so
likely the protein

595
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:15,730
is completely
absent or it

596
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:17,510
just is not
functioning properly.

597
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:24,390
Intermediate
metabolizers have one

598
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,370
functional allele
and they may be

599
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:28,070
phenotypically similar.
In other words,

600
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:30,810
they do metabolize
at the same rate as

601
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:33,550
the vast majority
of the population.

602
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:37,010
Extensive
metabolizers have two

603
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:39,630
functional genes,
so two alleles

604
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:42,250
are supposed to
be functioning.

605
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:46,190
So this would be when

606
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:48,230
everything's
working fine.

607
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:52,810
This one is
one allele, but

608
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:55,230
phenotypically
it's working fine.

609
00:36:57,050 --> 00:37:00,270
And ultra-rapid
metabolizers.

610
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:03,550
So a patient who is an

611
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:05,690
ultra-rapid metabolizer

612
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:12,430
metabolizes at a much
increased rate. And

613
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:15,850
what happens when the
rate of metabolism

614
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:20,170
of a drug is very much
increased well the

615
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:23,590
blood levels are
very much reduced and

616
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:27,010
therefore it will be
less likely to have a

617
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:30,910
therapeutic effect so
very high enzymatic

618
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:34,410
activity and this is
occasionally due to gene

619
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:37,230
duplication there's
considerable research

620
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:41,570
going on in
pharmacogenomics to identify

621
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:47,730
these different
phenotypes, genotypes and

622
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:51,310
phenotypes. Now,
polymorphisms in genes

623
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:56,210
for transporters and
major histocompatibility

624
00:37:56,210 --> 00:38:02,390
complex are also
potential causes for

625
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:05,270
differences in
pharmacokinetic properties.

626
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:14,740
These charts here
demonstrate the

627
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:18,740
differences in
population frequency

628
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:22,540
for the various types
of metabolizers.

629
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:25,220
We have poor
metabolizers here,

630
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:28,920
ultra-rapid metabolizers
here, so that's

631
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:35,310
either end of the
population. um ultra

632
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:41,700
ultra rapid
metabolizers this is an

633
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:44,740
indication of the
concentration versus

634
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:49,720
time curve and so
the peak is much

635
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:53,700
lower and the clearance
is much more rapid

636
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:57,460
poor metabolizers
just the opposite.

637
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:03,400
Poor metabolizers
for a given dose,

638
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,320
the concentration
can go up,

639
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,860
up, up, up, up
into toxicity land.

640
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:15,060
Ultra-rapid metabolizers
may be below the

641
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:17,940
therapeutic minimum
concentration. These

642
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:30,360
pie charts show the
relative activity of

643
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:33,460
the different enzymes,
or I should say

644
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:38,000
the relative metabolizing
capability of

645
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,860
the different
enzymes on drugs and

646
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,800
everything else that
goes into our bodies.

647
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:48,440
CYP3A4 mentioned
before nearly 50%.

648
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,840
And I'll be talking about

649
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:55,320
CYP1A2 in terms
of smoking.

650
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:59,560
It's a small
sliver, but it

651
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,220
is therapeutically
important.

652
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:09,600
And CYP2D6 has been
widely studied for poor

653
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:12,740
metabolizers and ultra
-rapid metabolizers.

654
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:15,640
And so forth.

655
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,540
Glucuronotransferase
is here,

656
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:25,280
the majority of drugs
that are metabolized

657
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:29,400
by phase 2 reaction
go through the UGTs,

658
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:34,940
NAT2 is sticking out
here because there

659
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:36,980
are some very
important interactions

660
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:40,360
that can occur
with, I should say

661
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,900
adverse events that
can occur with poor

662
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:48,040
metabolizers, and so on.

663
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:54,580
This is just to give
you a visual of the

664
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,100
activity of these
various enzymes.

665
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,440
So I put a star
on some of these

666
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:06,220
well, a lot of these

667
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,800
enzymes that we're going

668
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,880
to be talking about.

669
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:14,580
I am asking students
to know the mechanisms

670
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:17,280
mechanisms mechanisms
these are drugs here

671
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,160
that you may not know
the names of I'm not

672
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,860
asking you to memorize
the names at the

673
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:26,080
moment you need to know
the mechanisms so I

674
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:30,820
may use a drug name on
an exam item but it's

675
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:32,700
the mechanism that
you should be able to

676
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:36,680
recognize whether I use
a drug name hydralazine

677
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:39,880
or whether I use a
drug name drug A.

678
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:46,100
So NAT2, I mentioned
that one before,

679
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:49,280
N-acetyltransferase
type 2

680
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,200
for the poor
metabolizers.

681
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:55,880
There are three
drugs that really

682
00:41:55,880 --> 00:42:00,700
are known for producing
adverse effects

683
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:05,680
because of the
poor metabolism

684
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:09,300
of NAT2, poor
metabolizer phenotype.

685
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:13,080
So what happens?
Lupus-like syndrome.

686
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,140
I mentioned that
one before. It can

687
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:17,600
cause this autoimmune
-like reaction.

688
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,720
Liver toxicity.

689
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,040
We'll be talking over
and over and over

690
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,800
about the effect of
these drugs on heart

691
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,680
function. So QTC
interval prolongation.

692
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:39,940
We're where it's
lengthened. And when

693
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:42,700
that gets lengthened,
this QT interval,

694
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:46,420
then we can get
something called

695
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:49,020
ventricular arrhythmia
or trossade de point.

696
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,700
I have a picture of that.

697
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,920
CYP2D6, I mentioned
also that there has

698
00:42:54,920 --> 00:43:00,320
been a great amount
of studies on CYP2D6,

699
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:06,420
Metabolic SNPs and
pharmacogenomics.

700
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:09,520
Codeine, I'm sure
you know codeine.

701
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,220
You don't have to
memorize that one.

702
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:14,260
You already know
it. But what's

703
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:15,800
happening with
codeine, we're thinking

704
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:18,320
about ultra-rapid
metabolizers. Now

705
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,200
shift your thinking
for a moment.

706
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,780
Your thinking cap, shift

707
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:25,180
it over on your head.

708
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:32,300
codeine gets metabolized
to morphine I'm

709
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:36,180
sure you've heard of
morphine morphine is

710
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:40,240
very potent it's a
very potent opiate mu

711
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:44,980
opioid receptor agonist
so in people who are

712
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:49,520
ultra rapid metabolizers
of CYP2D6 who are

713
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:53,700
given codeine can
produce more morphine

714
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:57,000
because the rate of
metabolism of that codeine

715
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,920
is much more rapid.
It is therefore

716
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,100
producing more morphine
and more morphine will

717
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:05,780
therefore go into the
systemic circulation

718
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:09,340
and that can cause
toxicity. And And what

719
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:12,360
toxicity do we worry
about with opioids?

720
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:15,260
Respiratory depression,

721
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:17,220
which can lead to death.

722
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,120
And this is particularly

723
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:23,460
problematic in children,

724
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:28,960
especially young
children and

725
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:34,460
infants. Now,
codeine and morphine,

726
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,720
let's talk about
codeine, codeine gets

727
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,900
excreted in breast
milk, so the nursing

728
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:45,080
infant takes in the
codeine, and if they

729
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:50,560
happen to be a CYP2D6
ultra-rapid metabolizer

730
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:55,340
and make increased
levels of morphine,

731
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:59,640
that can lead to
respiratory depression in

732
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:02,440
the infant and that
can lead to death and

733
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:06,000
this actually is a
documented adverse effect

734
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:10,680
and then there are
lots of drugs that are

735
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:16,340
metabolized by cyp2d6
so if it's a drug that

736
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:18,560
just is metabolized
it's a substrate it's

737
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,840
not converted into
something active then

738
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:27,600
the levels of the drug
will be reduced for

739
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:31,360
ultra-rapid metabolizers
and increased for

740
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:34,000
poor metabolizers.
That's the concept.

741
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:37,620
Does the drug get
converted to an active

742
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:42,000
metabolite that will
have increased levels in

743
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,820
the ultra-rapid
metabolizer but decreased

744
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:48,960
levels in the poor
metabolizer? is the drug

745
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:53,080
just a substrate and
its own metabolism

746
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:56,760
and its own blood
levels will be affected.

747
00:45:57,650 --> 00:46:00,420
So that's the way
to think about

748
00:46:00,570 --> 00:46:03,860
the ultra-rapid and
poor metabolizers

749
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:06,520
with CYP2D6 and
everything else.

750
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:13,400
Now I mentioned the
phase 2 UGT. UGT, so

751
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:21,860
UGT1A1 is a widely
involved isoenzyme,

752
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:29,160
bilirubin is
metabolized, unconjugated

753
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:33,000
bilirubin is conjugated
and made water

754
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,900
-soluble by the
glucuronide metabolite.

755
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:41,720
So if this is
under-functioning,

756
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:45,280
then bilirubin
will be conjugated

757
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,340
to a lower degree.
So this doesn't

758
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:51,420
usually matter,
except in infants.

759
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:53,540
Here we go with
the infants again.

760
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:57,740
Infants have under
-functioning UGT to begin

761
00:46:57,740 --> 00:47:01,600
with, because it's
just not mature yet.

762
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:07,820
and bilirubin can
increase, unconjugated

763
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:11,180
bilirubin can increase
in blood, in the blood.

764
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:16,400
Now there are certain
drugs also that require

765
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:20,960
functioning UGT1A1
and when we get to

766
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:24,220
those drugs I'll ask
you to remember them.

767
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:29,340
The takeaway is
with bilirubin

768
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:31,260
which is a
physiologic product

769
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:34,020
Unconjugated bilirubin
can accumulate in

770
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:35,960
the blood, can cause
jaundice in the

771
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:38,980
neonate, and in
people who have under

772
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:43,600
-functioning UGT1A1 or
inhibited by another

773
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:46,500
drug, it can cause
jaundice in the adult.

774
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:50,840
Increased toxicity
of certain

775
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:53,040
cancer chemotherapeutics.
I'll talk

776
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,540
about that when
we get there.

777
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:04,780
this is the butterfly
rash of the lupus

778
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:08,580
lupus autoimmune
disease and lupus-like

779
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:18,360
syndrome here we have
a normal EKG with

780
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:24,060
a normal QT interval
Q Q is right here

781
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:31,940
T is right here,
and in this lower

782
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:35,780
figure the QT interval
is much prolonged.

783
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:42,480
This can be a
congenital problem and

784
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,920
patients don't usually
know they have it.

785
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:50,360
And if we use a
drug that's going

786
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,200
to prolong that
QT interval that

787
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:55,330
can lead to
the ventricular

788
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:58,340
fibrillation. Here's
Gilbert syndrome.

789
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:01,460
This is under
-functioning UGT1A1.

790
00:49:06,890 --> 00:49:10,610
G6PD deficiency has
a star on it. This

791
00:49:10,610 --> 00:49:15,130
is very important
because patients with

792
00:49:15,130 --> 00:49:18,410
G6PD deficiency who
are given oxidizing

793
00:49:18,410 --> 00:49:21,650
drugs can develop
hemolytic anemia.

794
00:49:22,270 --> 00:49:24,410
That's the
takeaway there.

795
00:49:28,610 --> 00:49:30,310
Heme synthesis,

796
00:49:30,430 --> 00:49:34,990
we have when
drugs will induce

797
00:49:36,290 --> 00:49:39,530
enzymes in that heme
synthesis pathway,

798
00:49:40,450 --> 00:49:43,810
patients can
develop porphyria.

799
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:45,690
Patients who have that

800
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:48,150
potential can develop it.

801
00:49:48,170 --> 00:49:49,690
Rhianodyne receptor,

802
00:49:49,830 --> 00:49:52,110
malignant hyperthermia,
we'll talk

803
00:49:52,110 --> 00:49:54,110
about that when we
get to those drugs.

804
00:49:56,690 --> 00:49:59,110
BKORC1, we're
going to talk about

805
00:49:59,110 --> 00:50:00,830
from now until
forever probably

806
00:50:00,830 --> 00:50:04,590
warfarin, but
we'll get into that

807
00:50:05,390 --> 00:50:07,190
when we get to the
anticoagulants.

808
00:50:11,530 --> 00:50:15,830
Here's the G6PD pathway.
Glucose 6-phosphate

809
00:50:15,830 --> 00:50:19,920
dehydrogenase or
dehydrogenase is essential

810
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:27,030
for forming NADPH,
which is essential

811
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:32,410
for reduction to of
the glutathione to the

812
00:50:32,410 --> 00:50:35,550
reduced form. And
glutathione is essential

813
00:50:35,550 --> 00:50:40,350
for inactivating
oxidative metabolites.

814
00:50:41,430 --> 00:50:44,890
And ADPH is also
important for

815
00:50:44,890 --> 00:50:50,310
conversion of methemoglobin
to the regular

816
00:50:50,310 --> 00:50:53,690
hemoglobin that
can bind oxygen.

817
00:50:57,370 --> 00:51:00,270
G6PD, we have some
examples here.

818
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:03,390
This is a bite cell.
I don't know if you

819
00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:04,770
can see it. It looks
like a bite that's

820
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:06,850
taken right out of
the red blood cell.

821
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:10,890
and blister cells.
It looks like

822
00:51:10,890 --> 00:51:12,570
this blister is
forming right on

823
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:15,010
the edge of the
red blood cell.

824
00:51:16,090 --> 00:51:19,290
So what's happening
here is the membrane

825
00:51:19,290 --> 00:51:20,550
of the red blood
cell has been

826
00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:25,050
weakened by these
oxidative agents that

827
00:51:25,050 --> 00:51:26,510
accumulate in
there because they

828
00:51:26,510 --> 00:51:30,770
haven't been detoxified
by glutathione.

829
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:36,290
This is a
picture of heme.

830
00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:37,890
So I talked about the

831
00:51:37,890 --> 00:51:39,370
heme synthesis pathway.

832
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:41,980
Here's some
cutaneous lesions

833
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:44,340
in a patient
with porphyria.

834
00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:48,510
And here's acute
photosensitivity

835
00:51:48,510 --> 00:51:51,890
reaction in a 10
-year-old boy with

836
00:51:51,890 --> 00:51:54,490
erythropoietic
protoporphyria.

837
00:51:57,810 --> 00:51:59,370
We talked about malignant

838
00:51:59,370 --> 00:52:04,010
hyperthermia and
the ryanodine

839
00:52:04,010 --> 00:52:08,970
receptor, and here's
the vitamin K.

840
00:52:08,970 --> 00:52:11,370
So those, I'm not asking
you to memorize them

841
00:52:11,370 --> 00:52:13,650
now, but when we get
to them, at least

842
00:52:13,650 --> 00:52:15,730
you'll know that you
heard about it somewhere.

843
00:52:19,030 --> 00:52:21,130
Long QT syndrome,

844
00:52:21,350 --> 00:52:23,590
congenital or acquired.

845
00:52:24,210 --> 00:52:26,130
Drugs can cause it.

846
00:52:26,430 --> 00:52:28,430
Serious and unpredictable

847
00:52:28,430 --> 00:52:32,010
ventricular arrhythmia.

848
00:52:32,170 --> 00:52:34,090
So serious,
people can die.

849
00:52:36,010 --> 00:52:39,110
Several, and then let's
move to HLA. There

850
00:52:39,110 --> 00:52:41,070
are several HLA
alleles that have been

851
00:52:41,070 --> 00:52:44,750
associated with an increased
risk of drug-induced

852
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:47,570
life-threatening
hypersensitivity

853
00:52:47,570 --> 00:52:50,210
reactions. I will be
talking about those a lot

854
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:55,730
when we get to the
drugs that are involved.

855
00:52:57,590 --> 00:53:03,910
We have the capability
now of screening

856
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:08,570
patients for various
HLA subtypes so

857
00:53:08,570 --> 00:53:10,470
that we can predict
whether or not a

858
00:53:10,470 --> 00:53:13,630
patient can take
the drug safely. And

859
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:19,930
this is just a
picture of what's

860
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:23,350
going on with the
long QT syndrome.

861
00:53:23,570 --> 00:53:29,010
Here is a picture
of an EKG tracing

862
00:53:29,010 --> 00:53:32,210
demonstrating
torsade de plant.

863
00:53:32,570 --> 00:53:35,130
Clearly, this
is not normal.

864
00:53:35,390 --> 00:53:39,050
And it is a
ventricular arrhythmia.

865
00:53:39,830 --> 00:53:43,450
We have a picture
here of a patient

866
00:53:43,450 --> 00:53:47,150
who is positive
for HLA-B5701.

867
00:53:47,870 --> 00:53:52,190
and is highly likely
to have an allergic

868
00:53:52,190 --> 00:53:56,950
reaction to abacavir,
which is an HIV drug.

869
00:53:56,950 --> 00:53:59,350
So that person should
not get that drug.

870
00:54:03,510 --> 00:54:06,090
Well, I keep talking
about adverse

871
00:54:06,090 --> 00:54:10,030
reactions. So if a
patient is at risk

872
00:54:10,030 --> 00:54:12,170
for a serious
adverse reaction and

873
00:54:12,170 --> 00:54:14,610
absolutely needs the
drug, does that mean

874
00:54:14,610 --> 00:54:17,080
the patient can't
get the drug? No.

875
00:54:21,290 --> 00:54:24,590
There are strategies
for mitigating

876
00:54:24,590 --> 00:54:28,910
the effects so that
a patient who really,

877
00:54:28,910 --> 00:54:30,610
really must have
a drug can have

878
00:54:30,610 --> 00:54:33,710
that drug. So some
strategies for reducing

879
00:54:33,710 --> 00:54:35,810
the risk of adverse
drug events.

880
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:39,750
Right drug, right
patient, right dose,

881
00:54:39,950 --> 00:54:42,790
right route, right time.

882
00:54:44,610 --> 00:54:47,510
We need to know
how to discontinue

883
00:54:47,510 --> 00:54:51,210
medications carefully.
We need to know

884
00:54:51,210 --> 00:54:54,390
how to initiate
medications carefully.

885
00:54:55,190 --> 00:54:57,930
We should prescribe
new medications

886
00:54:57,930 --> 00:55:00,950
sparingly. Don't just
give medications because

887
00:55:00,950 --> 00:55:03,090
the book says it'll
help doesn't so.

888
00:55:03,730 --> 00:55:06,730
They should be
used appropriately.

889
00:55:08,370 --> 00:55:11,130
Reducing the number of
prescribers, patients

890
00:55:11,130 --> 00:55:13,970
who go to five or six
or seven different

891
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:20,130
prescribers of medications,
can get overlap,

892
00:55:20,210 --> 00:55:23,350
can get more drugs
than they need, can

893
00:55:23,350 --> 00:55:25,510
get drugs that are
interacting with each

894
00:55:25,510 --> 00:55:28,290
other, and not all
drugs were are going to

895
00:55:28,290 --> 00:55:32,870
appear on your electronic
medical records.

896
00:55:32,870 --> 00:55:35,310
So you have to take a
very careful history.

897
00:55:37,330 --> 00:55:40,210
frequent reconciling
of medications go

898
00:55:40,210 --> 00:55:43,430
through what the patient
is taking educating

899
00:55:45,010 --> 00:55:48,430
prescribers and
educating patients

900
00:55:56,290 --> 00:55:58,850
knowledge is the
best strategy

901
00:56:03,930 --> 00:56:06,410
test your knowledge
what is the

902
00:56:06,410 --> 00:56:08,750
aim of pharmacogenomics
research,

903
00:56:08,750 --> 00:56:12,430
pharmacogenomics
research.

904
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:19,390
Precision medicine,
pharmacogenomic

905
00:56:19,390 --> 00:56:22,410
information identifying
novel genes and gene

906
00:56:22,410 --> 00:56:28,170
variants may predict
efficacy and safety

907
00:56:28,170 --> 00:56:32,050
or toxicity in the
individual patient.

908
00:56:32,050 --> 00:56:35,950
This information may
be included in the

909
00:56:35,950 --> 00:56:38,330
labeling of specific
drugs. So it's a matter

910
00:56:38,330 --> 00:56:49,250
of look it up in
the drug monograph.

911
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:52,090
It's easy to look up.

912
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:56,330
You'll have access to
that easily. You can

913
00:56:56,330 --> 00:57:00,570
have an app on your
phone where you work

914
00:57:00,570 --> 00:57:03,110
in the hospital or
in the practitioner's

915
00:57:03,370 --> 00:57:07,870
office may have access
to an electronic file.

916
00:57:08,250 --> 00:57:10,350
So look it up.

917
00:57:10,350 --> 00:57:13,390
When you see labeling,
that means you

918
00:57:13,390 --> 00:57:15,270
can look it up in
the monograph. So,

919
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:23,080
in summary, adverse
drug reactions

920
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:24,300
and adverse drug events

921
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:26,220
from overdose,
dose reductions,

922
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:28,760
above the straw of
a drug, resistance

923
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:31,120
to therapy,
paradoxical effects,

924
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:33,420
and drug disease,
drug-drug, drug

925
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:35,980
-supplement, drug
-food interactions.

926
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:39,220
Effects may range from
relatively benign,

927
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:41,500
and that's most
frequent, fortunately,

928
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:44,920
to serious, causing
significant morbidity

929
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:47,880
or death. It may
be acute, delayed,

930
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:49,140
or chronic.

931
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:54,380
These adverse drug
reactions and events

932
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:57,460
can result from overdose,
dose reductions,

933
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,800
abrupt withdrawal
of a drug,

934
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:02,720
resistance to
therapy, paradoxical

935
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:04,760
effects, drug
interactions.

936
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:08,540
Drug-induced
deleterious effects

937
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:10,480
to cells and organs
can be caused

938
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:13,800
by the parent drug,
a toxic metabolite,

939
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:16,380
or reactive
oxygen species.

940
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:19,180
Small chemicals
may form haptin

941
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:21,940
protein complexes
that activate the

942
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:24,000
immune system
against the complex.

943
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:27,280
Some drugs can
directly activate a

944
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:30,540
hypersensitivity reaction
in sensitive individuals.

945
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:35,430
Mechanisms include on
-target in the intended

946
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:40,340
or the unintended
tissue, and off-target,

947
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:42,970
again in the intended
or unintended tissue.

948
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:47,160
Drugs taken by the
pregnant individual can

949
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:50,050
cause teratogenicity
or other fetotoxicity.

950
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,940
Neonates can
manifest abstinence

951
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:55,260
syndrome resulting from

952
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:57,480
maternal use of
addictive drugs.

953
00:58:57,660 --> 00:59:00,540
Other effects on neonate
include *********

954
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:03,060
births and low
birth weight. The

955
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:05,440
pregnancy and lactation
labeling rule helps

956
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:07,780
prescribers communicate
the risks of

957
00:59:08,090 --> 00:59:12,160
pharmacologic treatment
to pregnant and

958
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:14,340
breastfeeding patients,
and preconception

959
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:17,220
advice to females of
reproductive potential

960
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:19,860
and males who wish
to father a child.

961
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:25,660
Polymorphisms in
metabolic enzymes are

962
00:59:25,660 --> 00:59:27,840
thought to underlie
individual differences

963
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:30,920
in the rate at which
drugs are metabolized.

964
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:33,840
The categories are
poor, intermediate,

965
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:37,370
extensive, and ultra
-rapid metabolizers.

966
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:40,240
Genetic variants
in transporters,

967
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:43,020
drug targets,
and variant HLA

968
00:59:43,020 --> 00:59:45,320
alleles may also
relate to an

969
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:48,020
individual's response
to drug therapy.

970
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:51,820
Pharmacogenomics research
is the systematic

971
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:55,840
examination of genes,
gene products, and

972
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:58,400
variation in gene
expression and function,

973
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:02,240
using tools for surveying
the entire genome.

974
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:06,280
Pharmacogenomics
researchers evaluate

975
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:10,080
multigenetic determinants
that may predict drug

976
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:13,160
response, efficacy and
safety, or drug toxicity

977
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:16,900
in an individual or
across a population.

978
01:00:17,510 --> 01:00:20,640
An aim of pharmacogenomics
research is to

979
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:25,060
guide decisions on
prevention, diagnosis, and

980
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:28,040
disease management
strategies using the

981
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:32,200
individual's clinical
and genetic information.

982
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:35,120
This information may
be included in the

983
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:37,120
labeling of specific
drugs, which may

984
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:39,720
help clinicians
select the drugs and

985
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:41,940
doses best suited
for the individual

986
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:45,480
patient based on their
individual genes.

987
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:49,800
Precision medicine is
an approach to tailoring

988
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:52,160
disease prevention
and treatment that

989
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:54,600
accounts for differences
in patients' genes,

990
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:57,480
lifestyles, and
environment.

991
01:00:57,480 --> 01:01:01,440
Right drug, right
patient, right dose,

992
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:02,700
right route,

993
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:04,160
right time.

994
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:07,200
And that concludes
this lecture on drug

995
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:11,460
toxicities, mechanisms,
and pharmacogenomics.
