1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:01,790
Welcome, students, to

2
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:04,250
Pharmacokinetics Part 2,

3
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:08,130
Principles of Metabolism
and Excretion.

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,090
And we will also talk
about the individual

5
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:13,690
variation in
response to drugs. We

6
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:16,290
talk about the big
picture, and then

7
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:19,270
we'll drill down to
what happens that can

8
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:21,890
cause changes in
our expectation to

9
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:24,410
drug response in the
individual patient.

10
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:27,390
Dr. Goldstein speaking.

11
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:31,870
please contact me if
you'd like to have a

12
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:35,270
chat about pharmacology
individuals and

13
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:39,610
groups are welcome
here are the learning

14
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:44,330
objectives mechanisms
mechanisms mechanisms

15
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:48,570
and these is all
about bio elimination

16
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:53,450
elimination by
biotransformation in other words

17
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:57,530
metabolism and
elimination by excretion.

18
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:02,370
My suggestions,

19
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,390
and please do
the practice

20
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,150
questions, they
will help you.

21
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,880
Here are some links
you might find

22
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,990
helpful if you
wish to use them.

23
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:18,290
I talked about the
key elements of

24
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:20,890
metabolism and
excretion in In

25
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:25,690
part one, this is
what we'll cover.

26
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:30,230
And let us begin
with the general

27
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:32,150
principles of
drug metabolism.

28
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:36,570
These are enzyme
-catalyzed conversion

29
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:41,910
of our drug, a
chemical, to some other

30
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:45,170
molecule, some other
chemical. We have

31
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:47,270
many, many protein
drugs that have been

32
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:50,090
developed in the
past 20 or 25 years.

33
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:54,650
Protein drugs are
subject to metabolism as

34
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,950
other proteins are,
proteolytic cleavage.

35
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:02,110
We need to also be
thinking about the

36
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:05,410
individual patient in
terms of pharmacogenomics.

37
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:10,310
People do have
variabilities in the

38
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:14,770
expression of their
various metabolic enzymes.

39
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:19,290
We'll talk about phase
1 and phase 2 reactions.

40
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:22,790
The genetic factors,
as I said, and we'll

41
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:25,250
also talk about
inhibition and induction,

42
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:35,630
which are mechanisms
of drug interactions.

43
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:40,630
Super important
concept. We'll go

44
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:43,350
into that more in
later lectures.

45
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:48,830
the liver is the
principal organ of drug

46
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:52,110
metabolism drug
metabolism concurrent can

47
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,550
occur in many tissues
but the liver is

48
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:59,550
actually built to do
that it has a large

49
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:02,950
blood flow it has a portal
circulation directly

50
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:06,190
from the intestines
to the liver it

51
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:11,590
has open spaces
sinusoidal fenestrations,

52
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:14,590
they're called, allowing
the blood to bring

53
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,630
all sorts of substances
into the liver,

54
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:21,310
high concentration
of metabolic enzymes,

55
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:24,210
high concentration
of transporters,

56
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:27,330
both the solute
carrier type and the

57
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:31,330
primary active that
use ATP for energy.

58
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:36,770
Solute carriers
are located in the

59
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:40,310
basolateral membrane
where they can allow

60
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:45,050
substrates to go
into the hepatocytes.

61
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:48,990
and ABC transporters,
our ATP type, are

62
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:52,270
located in the bile
canalicular system

63
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:58,210
in order to expulse
or efflux drugs

64
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:02,310
into the biliary
system for excretion.

65
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:08,070
This is just a quick
scheme. I will keep

66
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:10,610
talking about the
portal system.

67
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:16,130
Looking on the left
-hand side, the spleen,

68
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,470
stomach, pancreas,
small intestine,

69
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:22,790
colon, the whole
intestine drains into the

70
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:25,750
portal vein, which
goes to the liver.

71
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:31,650
The liver then goes
via the vena cava into

72
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:34,950
the heart, the right
atrium, and gets

73
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:39,150
cycled through the
heart, and the left

74
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:44,030
ventricle pushes blood
into the aorta, which

75
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:48,330
then leads to delivering
blood through the

76
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,630
arterial system to
all parts of the body.

77
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:58,850
This figure
shows the liver

78
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:01,410
and the gallbladder
underneath.

79
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:06,430
gallbladder squeezes
out the bile acids

80
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:11,210
when a person eats a
fatty meal bile acids

81
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:14,370
go into the duodenum
to emulsify that

82
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:17,970
fat for digestion and
it travels through

83
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:20,650
this is representing
the entire small

84
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:24,390
intestine to the
terminal ileum where the

85
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:28,030
bile acids the large
majority of bile acids

86
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,970
are then reabsorbed
back into the portal

87
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:33,970
vein, back into the
liver, where they

88
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:38,430
get recycled back
into the gallbladder.

89
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:40,850
Very efficient system.

90
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:46,530
If a drug enters the
gallbladder through

91
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:50,390
the bile canalicular
system, that

92
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:54,470
also will go back
into the intestine.

93
00:05:55,870 --> 00:06:00,710
and if it's a certain
metabolic product

94
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:04,270
like a glucuronide
then that may

95
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:09,690
actually be reactivated
which I'll go into

96
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:12,330
back into the portal
vein but otherwise

97
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:15,070
it just gets
excreted in the feces

98
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:21,710
and this is a picture
an illustration of

99
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:25,210
the liver lobule to
kind of give you the

100
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:28,850
landmarks to to be able
to visualize what's

101
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:33,270
going on in the liver
that you don't have to

102
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:36,290
memorize that I just
wanted to explain the

103
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:39,710
portal system and how
important that is when

104
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:42,150
we're talking about
drugs especially oral

105
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:46,910
drugs drugs may be
biotransformed to inactive

106
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:50,030
active or toxic
metabolites or more

107
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:54,230
hydrophilic readily
excretable products drugs

108
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:56,570
can also pass through
the liver unchanged

109
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:04,790
what happens is for
effective drugs that

110
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:09,010
pass through the liver
a certain fraction

111
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:13,550
of them will be
secreted unchanged

112
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:16,590
into the systemic
circulation and therefore

113
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:19,150
be available to
produce their effect.

114
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:26,290
Drug enters hepatocyte
through transporter,

115
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:29,850
solute carrier
transporter.

116
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:33,170
Drug has a number
of different

117
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:35,650
metabolic pathways
it can go into.

118
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:40,730
Phase one to a metabolite,
that metabolite

119
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:45,510
may be secreted into
the bile canaliculus

120
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:51,950
or it may just be
forming a metabolite

121
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:54,350
or two metabolites
or a variety of

122
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:59,790
metabolites and be secreted
into the bloodstream,

123
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:02,930
into the systemic
circulation. These

124
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:05,290
are most frequently
inactive, so they

125
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:07,650
would be excreted,
usually in the kidney.

126
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:10,430
These are excreted in
the feces, anything

127
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,460
that goes through
the bile canaliculi.

128
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:18,350
The drug may also go
straight to phase 2

129
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:22,250
and be secreted as
a metabolite, an

130
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:28,120
inactive metabolite
usually, vastly more

131
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,850
frequently as an an
active metabolite than

132
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:33,490
something that has
some sort of activity.

133
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:38,590
Or that metabolite
may be secreted into

134
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:42,420
the bile canaliculus.
And this is most

135
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:48,310
frequently the glucuronide
metabolite that

136
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:53,590
gets secreted into
the bile canaliculi.

137
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:57,510
Not exclusively,
but most frequently.

138
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:05,310
The drug can
be excreted as

139
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:08,270
is into the
bile canaliculi.

140
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:10,970
The drug can be excreted

141
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:14,670
as is into the
bloodstream.

142
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:17,830
So we have all of these
different options.

143
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,170
The vast majority of
drugs, though, will

144
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:25,250
undergo some level
of metabolism in the

145
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,910
liver. And if these
are oral drugs, they

146
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:31,550
will undergo on the
first pass through.

147
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:37,390
So let's talk about
first pass metabolism.

148
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:39,970
This is also called
first pass effect.

149
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:46,970
Drug gets swallowed,
goes to stomach,

150
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:50,230
goes to small
intestine where it is

151
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:56,030
absorbed. and it
enters the portal

152
00:09:56,030 --> 00:10:01,040
circulation ah but there
are metabolic enzymes

153
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,470
in the epithelial
cells of the gut

154
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:08,770
and the drug may be
metabolized also in

155
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:12,290
the gut not all
drugs but some drugs

156
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:17,370
the drug gets to the
liver and it undergoes

157
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:20,450
metabolism to some
degree which i will

158
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:23,340
talk about more in
a future lecture so

159
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,470
because this is oral
administration and

160
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,270
goes to the liver
first it's called first

161
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:32,670
pass effect or first
pass metabolism or

162
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:35,510
first pass hepatic
metabolism all of those

163
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:39,150
are the same meaning,
the same process.

164
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:45,170
Any drug that actually
leaves the liver as

165
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:50,030
active drug into the
systemic circulation will

166
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:55,470
then produce its
effect and the fraction

167
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:59,990
that enters the systemic
circulation is called

168
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:03,610
the bioavailability
of the drug it is

169
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:08,290
available biologically
to produce its biological

170
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:12,900
effect so first pass
metabolism first pass

171
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:17,270
effect so let's talk
about phase one metabolic

172
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:19,870
reactions these are
oxidation reduction

173
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:27,970
and hydrolysis what happens
here is a functional

174
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:31,490
group is exposed
something like this

175
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:37,090
these are pretty typical
and that will most

176
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:41,050
frequently it caused
inactivation of the drug

177
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:46,670
molecule which may then
be secreted and into

178
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:49,270
the systemic circulation
and excreted or

179
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:52,970
secreted into the biliary
system and excreted.

180
00:11:55,870 --> 00:12:00,290
Sometimes an active
metabolite is formed.

181
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:03,310
That active metabolite
goes into the systemic

182
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:06,070
circulation and
produces an effect and

183
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:10,270
is eventually
inactivated through

184
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:12,270
other metabolic
processes.

185
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:15,250
Toxic metabolites
can form.

186
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:22,590
Sometimes the product
will undergo phase two

187
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:25,890
because it's not
soluble enough to be

188
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:30,490
excreted as a hydrophilic
compound in the kidney.

189
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:32,900
So we have all these
different options.

190
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:39,050
The cytochrome P450
mixed function oxidase

191
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:46,770
system are really
the most frequent

192
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:49,870
phase one metabolic
reactions. It's

193
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:52,590
this big super family
it's called and

194
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:55,510
they're referred to as
CYPs. I refer to them

195
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:58,370
as CYPs. Many people
call them CYPs.

196
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:04,450
They are abundant in
the liver. They're

197
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:08,390
present in many other
tissues. They are located

198
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:11,910
on the lipophilic
membranes of the smooth

199
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,990
endoplasmic reticulum.
So they're kind of

200
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:18,050
hanging out right
there on the membranes.

201
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:21,610
And when a substrate
passes by and binds to

202
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:26,470
it, it will then
metabolize that molecule.

203
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:29,710
They have low
substrate specificity.

204
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:33,150
That means that
they're capable

205
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:36,590
of metabolizing
many, many, many,

206
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:39,070
many different
types of substrates.

207
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:45,230
And that's not all they
do, not just drugs.

208
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:48,070
They're also involved
in the metabolism

209
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:52,370
of steroids and fatty
acids and many other

210
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:55,430
products in our body,
natural products.

211
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,530
Heme is required.

212
00:13:57,530 --> 00:14:03,070
Heme has iron in
it, and iron is

213
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:06,390
essential for the
action of the CYPs.

214
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:09,290
I'll explain that
on the next slide.

215
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:13,850
They are susceptible
to inhibition and

216
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:16,430
induction. In
other words, if a

217
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:20,770
substrate is present
on the active site of

218
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:28,110
the CYP and another
drug comes along,

219
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:32,430
the second drug
will not be able

220
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:34,590
to access the
active site and will

221
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:37,870
therefore pass
by unmetabolized.

222
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:41,550
When there is significant

223
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:46,490
inhibition of CYPs,
there can be an increase

224
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:49,310
in the bioavailability,
an increase in the

225
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:51,890
amount of drug that
actually reaches the

226
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:55,130
systemic circulation.
So there is a higher

227
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:58,530
concentration of drug in
the systemic circulation.

228
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:01,150
And remember, the
amount of drug in the

229
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:04,310
systemic circulation
determines the amount

230
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:08,530
of drug at the site of
action, which in turn

231
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:13,530
determines the magnitude
of the effect. So

232
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:17,470
this is a drug interaction
that could lead to

233
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:21,510
increased effect
toxicity adverse effects.

234
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:25,970
Induction, on the other
hand, is an increase

235
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:30,590
in the number of
enzymes available. As

236
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:34,530
a result, the rate
of drug metabolism

237
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:38,390
increases, which can
lower the amount of drug

238
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,630
that reaches the
systemic circulation.

239
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:45,930
And we also have
pharmacogenetic

240
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:51,590
mutations in drug
metabolism. That's

241
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:54,390
really what this
is all about.

242
00:15:55,330 --> 00:16:02,170
Where the enzyme
is changed somehow

243
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,390
compared to the
majority of the

244
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:07,550
population. Perhaps it
is under-functioning.

245
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:10,310
Perhaps it is
over-functioning.

246
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:17,050
The mechanism of
CYPs, as I said,

247
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:20,350
they're embedded
in the membrane

248
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,710
of the endoplasmic
reticulum.

249
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:31,030
And here's a blow up
of that they have this

250
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:35,770
heme inside and it
is the heme that's

251
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:40,270
essential for this
oxidative reaction here's

252
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:43,570
our substrate it's
going to bump into our

253
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:49,410
drug metabolizing enzyme
and be metabolized

254
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:54,290
and here's the process
a A reducing agent

255
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:58,250
is required, and here
we have our reductase.

256
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:01,670
We also need oxygen,

257
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,170
and of course the drug.

258
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:08,370
So the drug plus
the reducing agent

259
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:11,030
will, well, let
me start here.

260
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,210
Here's drug.

261
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:17,110
Step number one. It goes
through the process,

262
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:27,090
picks up an electron,
picks up oxygen,

263
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:35,810
and becomes oxidized.
you do not have to

264
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:40,590
memorize this whole cycle
this is the part you

265
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:45,150
need to remember the
drug the oxygen the

266
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:49,330
reducing agent produces
the metabolite let's

267
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,110
check your knowledge

268
00:17:56,870 --> 00:18:01,370
i invite you to pause
the video see if

269
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:02,930
you can answer these
questions without

270
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:05,490
looking them up and
then go ahead and look

271
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,270
them up and try and
answer them again

272
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:13,410
okay let's look at the
answer CYP metabolism

273
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:20,730
requires what three
elements heme the

274
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:27,150
reducing agent NADPH and
oxygen CYP 450 enzymes

275
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:31,090
are called mono
oxygenases adds an oxygen

276
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,670
CYPs are susceptible
to alteration in

277
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:38,390
rates of drug
elimination, rates, rates,

278
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:41,230
everything in pharmacokinetics
is about rates,

279
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:42,750
by what?

280
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:48,090
Inhibition or
induction of CYPs

281
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:51,190
and by pharmacogenetic or

282
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:54,090
pharmacogenomics
variabilities.

283
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:56,610
How do these alterations

284
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:58,810
potentially affect
patient care?

285
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,230
Alterations in plasma
drug concentrations

286
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:05,450
can lead to increased
potential for

287
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:09,010
toxicity by inhibition
or an under-functioning

288
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:13,470
enzyme, or reduced
efficacy by induction

289
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:17,510
or an ultra-rapidly
functioning enzyme.

290
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:21,870
How is a knowledge of
clinically relevant

291
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:24,350
pharmacokinetic
properties of drugs

292
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:28,130
essential for
patient care. This is

293
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:31,090
why we're learning
about all of this.

294
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:35,810
Mechanisms of drug
interactions and effects

295
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:39,550
of organ function on
plasma drug levels.

296
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:43,150
Because it is
the drug levels

297
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:48,310
that determine the
levels at the site of

298
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:51,670
action that determines
the magnitude of effect.

299
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:54,970
Efficacy and the
potential for adverse

300
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:58,770
effects. The right
drug and the right dose

301
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:03,330
for the right duration
for optimal outcomes.

302
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:09,650
Please make this part

303
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:11,770
of your second nature.

304
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:18,570
all right phase two
metabolic reactions

305
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:21,850
now these transfer
hydrophilic group

306
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:24,430
to the substrate
increasing its polarity

307
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:26,550
and the products
are really almost

308
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:31,030
always 99.9 percent
of the time inactive.

309
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:37,770
These are conjugation
reactions. They

310
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:42,410
transfer a molecule, a
hydrophilic molecule,

311
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:49,330
from a cofactor and
place it on the drug

312
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:52,350
or metabolite. So
they're transferring.

313
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:56,370
The enzymes, therefore,
are transferases.

314
00:20:56,370 --> 00:21:00,120
This example is UDP

315
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,830
-glucuronaciltransferase
or glucuronal

316
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,890
transferase. Both
terms are correct.

317
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:11,930
Which is the major
transferase in the Phase

318
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:17,410
II armamentarium of
metabolic reactions.

319
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,130
UGT1A1 is a
pretty common one.

320
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:22,190
This is how
they are called.

321
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:26,670
UDP,
glucuronaciltransferase,

322
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:29,590
UGT for short.

323
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,370
And that's all there
is to it. It takes

324
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:39,130
molecule from a
donor and attaches

325
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:43,270
it to the drug
molecule or metabolite.

326
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:44,030
That's it.

327
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:46,910
Hydrophilic, excretion,

328
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:48,670
usually through
the kidney.

329
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:59,130
These are the six
different transferases.

330
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:02,650
So UGT I mentioned
was the major one.

331
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:07,340
It gets its glucuronic
acid from UDP,

332
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:12,150
uridine diphosphate,
glucuronic acid.

333
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:14,330
You do not need
to memorize

334
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:16,720
the names of
the cofactors.

335
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:23,290
get the idea that they
are bringing along

336
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:26,960
the hydrophilic molecule
to be transferred

337
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,110
to the drug or
metabolite. You do

338
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:33,870
need to know the name
of the transferases.

339
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:38,510
So we have UGT,
UDP-glucuronacil

340
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:41,070
transferase, or glucuronal
transferase, both

341
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:46,580
are correct. A
sulfotransferase, transferring

342
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:49,150
a sulfate. You
do need to know

343
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:51,750
what gets transferred,
not the cofactor.

344
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,930
And acetyltransferase,
we will be

345
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:56,390
talking about
this plenty of

346
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:59,450
times because of
pharmacogenetics.

347
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:01,630
So acetyl, naturally.

348
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:04,770
Methyltransferase,
transfers methyl.

349
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:08,770
Glutathione.

350
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:12,490
super important in
our bodies because

351
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:15,850
this catalyzes the
nucleophilic attack of

352
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:18,830
glutathione on
electrophilic atoms and

353
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:21,330
xenobiotics and toxic
metabolites so what's

354
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:24,570
all of that all of
that that were all

355
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:27,210
those words what is
the take-home message

356
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:33,410
it detoxifies reactive
oxygen species.

357
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:38,370
And when we run
out of glutathione

358
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:40,870
S transferase
because of starvation

359
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:45,270
or serious, serious
illness, then

360
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:48,270
these toxic metabolites
can hurt us.

361
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:50,810
Glycine is a
little amino acid.

362
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:54,350
It's seen
occasionally. It's not

363
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,110
really one of the
major pathways.

364
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,790
Anyway, these are
all hydrophilic

365
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:01,610
metabolites that
result and they

366
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:04,030
can be readily
excreted in urine.

367
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:09,450
Now let's talk about
enterohepatic circulation

368
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:13,130
and we'll talk about
them as glucuronide

369
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:16,070
metabolites which is
the vast majority.

370
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:23,410
Here on the left
is a picture of the

371
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:27,570
arrangement of the
organs and the liver.

372
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:32,390
Stomach, so food
goes in here.

373
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:35,690
Small intestine,

374
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:39,570
large intestine.

375
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:47,550
Here is the portal
circulation draining

376
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:55,230
all of these organs
and the veins,

377
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:59,570
the venous circulation
in the liver.

378
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,700
Okay, so that's how
it's set up. So what

379
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:07,190
we're going to be talking
about with enteroepatic

380
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:11,190
circulation is as
the drug travels from

381
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,330
the gallbladder, which
is in here underneath

382
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:17,950
the liver, into the
duodenum and travels

383
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:20,310
through the small
intestine, and it gets down

384
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:28,990
here, it will then be
reabsorbed into the

385
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:31,130
portal circulation and
go back to the liver.

386
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,430
okay so what's
happening drug

387
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:36,190
gets swallowed drug gets

388
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:37,770
absorbed from the
small intestine

389
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:41,170
goes to the liver
via the portal system

390
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:46,390
gets a glucuronide stuck
on it that glucuronide

391
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:50,410
metabolite goes into
the biliary system

392
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:52,310
and gets stored in
the gallbladder along

393
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:55,610
with bile acids
Now, somebody eats a

394
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:59,950
fatty meal, and the
glucuronide metabolite is

395
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:03,050
excreted along with
the bile acids and

396
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:07,470
transported in this
really very simple figure

397
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:12,290
here, down here to
the terminal ileum.

398
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:20,110
So that glucuronide
group is cleaved

399
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:23,830
off by intestinal
bacteria

400
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:28,930
flora, which are
populating this area

401
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:30,830
and the whole
large intestine.

402
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:37,190
When that glucuronide
gets cleaved off, we

403
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:40,290
now have active
drug again, and it's

404
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:44,190
lipophilic. So by passive
diffusion, it goes back

405
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:46,610
into the portal
system and back to the

406
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:51,670
liver where it may
be undergo this same

407
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:55,270
situation again. But we
need to remember it's

408
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:58,520
not 100% of the drug
that gets metabolized.

409
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:01,310
I don't know what
percentage it

410
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:03,050
is, so I'll make
up a percentage.

411
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:06,810
Let's say 50% of the
original drug got

412
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:09,150
metabolized and goes
into the gallbladder

413
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:10,850
and blah, blah,
blah and around the

414
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:16,570
circle. So, now, what's
coming back in will

415
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:20,750
get metabolized about
50% of that, and

416
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:24,150
all of this goes
into the bloodstream.

417
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:27,070
The other 50%
goes into the

418
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:29,450
bloodstream as
active drug.

419
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:33,310
Therefore, with
enterohepatic

420
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:39,450
circulation, that
can contribute to the

421
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:42,290
levels in the
systemic circulation.

422
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:44,850
So that's the
takeaway message with

423
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:48,010
enterohepatic
circulation of drugs.

424
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:54,850
well i keep talking
about all these various

425
00:27:54,850 --> 00:28:00,430
enzymes so what
role do they play in

426
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:04,470
metabolism each individual
one on this figure we

427
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:11,770
see the cyp3a4 and 5s
the cyp3a family is

428
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:17,890
about 50% of the CYP
oxidative metabolism.

429
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:21,970
Different sources have
different fractions,

430
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:26,410
but the point is they
all agree that the

431
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:32,490
majority of CYP activity
is by CYP3A family.

432
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:38,070
CYP2D6 plays a pretty
decent portion.

433
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:41,040
We'll talk about that
with pharmacogenomics

434
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,210
at a later
time, and we see

435
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:45,190
little slices from
all these others.

436
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:51,190
UGT here also
is the majority

437
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:53,910
of the transferase
activity.

438
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:57,220
Sulfates has a
pretty good size,

439
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:59,030
glutathione,

440
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:03,910
N-acetyltransferase,
and all the rest.

441
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:07,750
You don't have to
memorize this, just take

442
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:14,690
away the points that
CYP3A family and UDP

443
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:18,150
glucuronal transferase
are very, very

444
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:20,630
important pathways. But
so are the others, they

445
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:23,370
just don't handle
quite as much traffic.

446
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:27,250
All right, check
your knowledge.

447
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:33,570
I, again, invite you
to pause the computer,

448
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:35,710
take a look at
these questions, see

449
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:37,600
if you can answer
them without looking.

450
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:42,750
Okay, let us return now.

451
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:45,750
How do phase 2 reactions

452
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:50,930
differ from phase
1 reactions?

453
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:53,190
Think of three ways.

454
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:56,650
Phase I reactions
are oxidation.

455
00:29:57,410 --> 00:29:59,970
Phase II are conjugation.

456
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:02,990
Phase I expose a
functional group.

457
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:06,330
Phase II transfer
a hydrophilic

458
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:08,850
substance from
a cofactor.

459
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:12,010
Phase I
metabolites may be

460
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,870
inactive, active, toxic.

461
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:17,490
Phase II metabolites
are hydrophilic,

462
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:20,950
readily excreted, and
almost always inactive.

463
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:24,910
True or false?
Phase II reactions

464
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:27,270
must follow Phase
I reactions.

465
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,510
No, that's
false, of course.

466
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:32,050
Drugs that have a
polar functional group

467
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:35,570
already exposed on their
structures may directly

468
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:39,070
undergo a Phase II
conjugation reaction.

469
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:44,270
What types of drug
metabolites frequently

470
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:47,710
undergo enteropatic
circulation? The

471
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:52,630
glucuronide metabolites,
which may go

472
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:57,110
through the kidney, or
they may be secreted

473
00:30:57,110 --> 00:31:00,510
into the biliary
system by P

474
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:03,890
-glycoprotein efflux or
by passive diffusion.

475
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:06,990
These are two
methods by which

476
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,450
drugs get into the
biliary system.

477
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:12,910
Bacteria that express
beta-glucuronidase

478
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:15,150
cleave the
glucuronide, releasing

479
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:18,370
free drug, which is
then reabsorbed by

480
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:21,890
passive diffusion in
the terminal ileum.

481
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:25,210
Excretion now.

482
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:32,270
The kidney is by far
the most frequent

483
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:38,590
route of excretion
of drugs and

484
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:42,010
metabolites and lots
of other things.

485
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:45,790
They eliminate
polar compounds

486
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:47,390
more efficiently
than substances

487
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:49,470
with high lipid
solubility.

488
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:55,550
Renal drug handling.

489
00:31:56,210 --> 00:32:01,860
They may be filtered
from the blood in the

490
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:04,320
glomerulus. So let's
say this is the

491
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,890
glomerulus. This is drug
going in through the

492
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:11,390
afferent arteriole.
The blood goes through

493
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:14,730
the capillary system
in the glomerulus and

494
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:18,950
goes out through the
efferent arteriole.

495
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:23,430
And meanwhile, the
plasma gets filtered by

496
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:26,700
this capillary system
that has fenestrations

497
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:30,910
or spaces in between
the capillaries, and

498
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:39,810
the drug or metabolites
go into the nephron.

499
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:43,330
Another way to get
them in, because

500
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:46,290
plasma, only about
20% of plasma

501
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:48,830
gets filtered at
any pass through.

502
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:53,810
There is a tubular
capillary network that

503
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:56,770
goes around the nephron.
Don't go by this

504
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:59,590
picture, it doesn't
really show you, because

505
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:01,830
it's intended to show
you something else.

506
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:08,090
Drug in the
bloodstream can also be

507
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:11,090
secreted into the
nephron. So those

508
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:13,010
are two pathways
to get in there,

509
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:15,150
glomerular filtration,

510
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:17,870
active tubular secretion.

511
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:22,230
Remember, drugs that
are bound to proteins

512
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:24,530
are not going to
be able to pass

513
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:27,410
through the glomerulus,
only free drug.

514
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:28,430
Okay,

515
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:32,590
now, drug passes
through the nephron,

516
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:35,130
various things happen
in the nephron, you'll

517
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:37,370
learn about that in
the renal system. And

518
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:41,490
it can get into the
distal tubule where it

519
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:46,550
can be, if it is
lipophilic and active

520
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:50,610
drug, it can be
reabsorbed back into the

521
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:53,490
bloodstream and travel
around the body again.

522
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:58,710
If not, it will be
excreted in the urine.

523
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:01,270
That's the basic idea.

524
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:04,950
glomerular filtration
or active tubular

525
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:07,230
secretion to get
into the nephron,

526
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:12,570
passive reabsorption
out of the distal

527
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:15,570
tubule if it is
lipophilic, and

528
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:18,230
otherwise it gets
excreted in the urine.

529
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:22,690
Altering the urinary
pH to favor ionization

530
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:27,430
can enhance excretion
of charged species,

531
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:30,690
charged forms of weak
acids or weak bases.

532
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:38,050
renal function is not
constant even in the

533
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:40,810
healthy person the
neonate's renal function

534
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:43,990
is low compared with
body mass but matures

535
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:46,810
rapidly within the first
few months of birth

536
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:50,330
adults experience a
slow decline in renal

537
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:54,610
function inexorable
elderly patients may

538
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:57,470
have substantial kidney
function impairment,

539
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:01,910
even if it's not
caused by disease.

540
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:04,110
And of course,

541
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:06,350
both acute and
chronic disease can

542
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:08,130
certainly modify
renal function.

543
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:13,090
Here's a better picture
of the glomerulus

544
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:16,430
and the capillary
network inside here.

545
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:22,150
There are big
spaces, it's kind of

546
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:24,370
indicated by these
little dots here.

547
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:27,590
Those are big spaces
where plasma gets

548
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:31,650
filtered through
into the nephron.

549
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:35,370
Filtered because it
takes in the plasma and

550
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:37,250
solutes anything
that's dissolved in

551
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:40,550
the plasma, but keeps
out the proteins.

552
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,250
Oops, excuse me,
wrong button.

553
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:49,030
The takeaway here,
this is what you are

554
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:52,730
expected to remember.
the glomerular filtration

555
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:56,830
rate is a determinant
of renal function we

556
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:59,830
will be talking about
renal function when it

557
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:02,350
comes to drug therapy
over and over and over

558
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:05,090
and what we're talking
about is the ability

559
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:08,510
of the glomerulus to
do its filtration job

560
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:12,870
glomerular
filtration rate is a

561
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:16,310
useful measure of
renal function there

562
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:18,950
are limitations
it is a biomarker.

563
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:23,130
Glomerular filtration
rate is the

564
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:26,330
sum of all of the
functioning nephrons

565
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:28,690
and it is a
rough measure of

566
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:30,970
the number of
functioning nephrons.

567
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:33,850
The rate of filtration.

568
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:42,210
Serum creatinine
and creatinine

569
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:46,810
clearance are
estimates, biomarkers

570
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:48,950
of glomerular
filtration rate.

571
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:54,470
Creatinine is the end
product of creatine

572
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:56,630
metabolism from
skeletal muscle.

573
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:59,270
Please don't confuse
these two terms.

574
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:03,010
Creatinine
production is stable.

575
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:07,270
Creatinine is filtered
through the glomerulus

576
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:10,130
and a small amount
is secreted and

577
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:15,020
it's not reabsorbed.
So that's why measuring

578
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:18,890
creatinine in the
blood or creatinine

579
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:23,870
in the urine is an
estimate of glomerular

580
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:26,610
filtration rate. The
rate at which creatinine

581
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:31,270
passes through is
essentially equal

582
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:35,350
to GFR. And I'm saying
essentially there

583
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:38,990
are drawbacks, but
that's a lecture for a

584
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:42,700
later time. Nonetheless,
it's still a

585
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:48,770
frequently used indicator
of renal function,

586
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:53,630
and we use it for
renal dosing, dosing

587
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:56,470
for individuals who
have renal impairment.

588
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:01,910
I'm not going to ask
you to memorize these

589
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:05,070
various equations
and there are a

590
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:10,930
number of automatic
equations that you can

591
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:13,490
get where you just
put in the numbers and

592
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:15,510
the computer will
work it out for you.

593
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:18,670
Creatinine clearance
is determined by

594
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:22,250
collecting a timed
urine sample. 24 hours

595
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:26,510
sample is the
standard of care and

596
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:28,550
clearance is then
expressed in milliliters

597
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:31,210
per minute. That's
how we talk about GFR

598
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:34,830
and milliliters per
minute of clearance.

599
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:39,610
So let's check the
knowledge again. I invite

600
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:43,510
you to pause the video
and see if you can

601
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:45,930
come up with these
answers from your memory.

602
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:50,530
Okay so let us return.

603
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:54,530
What are the processes
involved in renal

604
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:56,710
excretion of drugs
and metabolites?

605
00:38:57,690 --> 00:39:01,090
Molecules not bound to
plasma proteins enter

606
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:04,700
the kidney via
glomerular filtration or

607
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:08,190
act of secretion into
the proximal tubule.

608
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:10,470
If lipophilic, they
may be passively

609
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:14,010
reabsorbed in the distal
tubule. If not, drugs

610
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:16,650
and metabolites are
excreted in the urine.

611
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:20,290
What is the most
frequently used biomarker

612
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:24,930
of kidney function serum
creatinine also urine

613
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:27,970
creatinine which requires
a urine collection

614
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:32,270
over time serum
creatinine is a blood

615
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:37,210
test glomerular filtration
rate shows how well

616
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:41,170
the kidneys are filtering
and finally what

617
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:44,250
is the clinical
relevance of gfr on drug

618
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:48,310
therapy A low GFR means
kidney function is

619
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:52,750
impaired, which means
drugs may not be excreted

620
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:56,370
at the usual rate
and can accumulate in

621
00:39:56,370 --> 00:40:00,090
the blood, increasing
the risk of toxicity.

622
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:02,810
This is why we care.

623
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:05,970
Drug therapy may
need to be adjusted,

624
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:08,890
and we call this
renal dosing.

625
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:13,630
And finally, variation
in drug response.

626
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:17,610
Many, many factors
can impact the rate at

627
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:23,130
which drugs are cleared,
are eliminated, and

628
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:26,470
these need to be taken
into consideration

629
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:29,610
when considering
drug therapy for your

630
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:33,830
individual patient,
whether it's for adjustment

631
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:37,350
of dosing or possibly
avoiding certain

632
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:42,870
drugs. This wheel lists
all of these different

633
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:46,810
things that it could
be and I'd like to

634
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:55,270
also add to it genetic
variability. Don't

635
00:40:55,270 --> 00:41:00,290
forget about that. This
is becoming much easier

636
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:05,170
to identify as screening
tests are becoming

637
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:08,230
more available and
more affordable the

638
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:15,970
older patient and the
neonates i'll focus

639
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:19,690
on them for the older
patient there may

640
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:22,190
be multiple concurrent
diseases that are

641
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:24,610
going to affect
your drug therapy so

642
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:28,830
drug disease
interactions intestinal

643
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:31,670
intestinal motility may
be reduced blood flow

644
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:34,210
may be reduced muscle
mass may reduced

645
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:38,450
body fat may be
increased kidney function

646
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:41,370
reduction liver
function reduction and

647
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:43,610
then just general
structural and functional

648
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:45,530
changes in the brain
that can occur.

649
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:47,350
In the neonate, they

650
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:49,490
have immature processes,

651
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:51,830
absorption, distribution,

652
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:53,710
metabolism,
and excretion.

653
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:57,080
We have to be
very, very careful

654
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:57,970
dosing them,
and it should

655
00:41:57,970 --> 00:41:59,900
be left to the
neonatologist.

656
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:03,190
Blood flow, GI function,

657
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:06,310
they are just little
bags of water,

658
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:08,250
especially the
********* babies.

659
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:12,570
lower plasma protein
binding capacity

660
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:15,770
because their livers
are not producing them

661
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:18,210
to the same degree
as in the older

662
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:23,770
child even the older
infant low activity

663
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:25,990
of the drug
metabolizing enzymes and

664
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:29,100
transporters they're
not mature yet lower

665
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:33,270
glomerular filtration
rate potentially or

666
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:37,170
even higher glomerular
filtration rate.

667
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:43,630
So in summary, I have
put you a little mind

668
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:47,030
map again. If you find
these helpful, make

669
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:48,890
them yourself. You
can make simple ones.

670
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:51,470
They don't have to be
complicated and they

671
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:54,590
can help you connect
the dots as it were.

672
00:42:56,170 --> 00:42:57,950
Here's another one.

673
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:02,390
And biotransformation
is a complex

674
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:05,230
process involving
numerous enzyme systems

675
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:08,730
that usually detoxify
the xenobiotics.

676
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:13,850
Xeno meaning
foreign or not

677
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,630
occurring naturally
in our bodies.

678
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,410
Phase I reactions include
oxidation, reduction,

679
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:23,470
hydrolysis. These
processes unmask a

680
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:26,170
polar functional group.
And the products may

681
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:31,850
be inactive, usually,
or active or toxic.

682
00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:35,410
Phase II reactions
involve the addition

683
00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:37,530
of a subgroup, and
that's called a

684
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:41,630
conjugation, with the
drug or metabolite.

685
00:43:42,610 --> 00:43:46,050
These are the
glucuronide, I should

686
00:43:46,050 --> 00:43:48,170
say glucuronide,
not glucuronate,

687
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:50,830
acetate, sulfate,
methylate,

688
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:52,370
and glycine groups.

689
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:54,710
The enzymes that
catalyze the

690
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:56,890
reactions are
called transferases.

691
00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:03,610
they transfer the
subgroup supplied

692
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:05,770
by a cofactor
onto the substrate

693
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:08,850
phase two metabolites
are significantly

694
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:10,890
more hydrophilic
than the substrate

695
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:13,530
and are readily
excreted usually

696
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:18,450
definitely most frequently
in the urine drugs

697
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:20,710
metabolized by both
phase one and phase

698
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:24,130
two reactions may undergo
phase 1 before phase

699
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:27,430
2 or go directly to
phase 2 or there may be

700
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:30,910
complicated metabolic
reactions occurring.

701
00:44:31,310 --> 00:44:34,790
Drug disposition is also
affected by membrane

702
00:44:34,790 --> 00:44:37,010
transport proteins
which mediate the

703
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:40,350
cellular uptake and
efflux of xenobiotics in

704
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:44,050
the liver, kidney, and
many many many other

705
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:50,050
tissues. The Phase I
CYP enzymes biotransform

706
00:44:50,050 --> 00:44:53,270
most xenobiotics. CYPs
are expressed in a

707
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:55,910
high concentration in
the membrane of the

708
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:58,910
smooth endoplasmic
reticulum of the liver and

709
00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:01,310
in lower concentrations
in other tissues.

710
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:04,950
CYPs are relatively
non-selective. A

711
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:08,950
small number of P450
isoforms metabolize

712
00:45:08,950 --> 00:45:11,230
thousands and
thousands of drugs.

713
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:15,470
CYP3A4 is the most
abundant isoform

714
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:18,770
metabolizing in some
estimates, in most

715
00:45:18,770 --> 00:45:21,410
estimates, about
50% of all drugs.

716
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:25,250
Enzyme activity can
vary due to concurrent

717
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:29,110
administration of other
drugs that inhibit

718
00:45:29,110 --> 00:45:32,330
or induce the drug
metabolizing enzymes.

719
00:45:32,850 --> 00:45:35,670
Enzyme inhibition
can reduce the

720
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:37,890
rate of metabolism
of the substrate

721
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:40,710
drug, leading to
increased systemic

722
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:43,430
levels, increased
bioavailability.

723
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,330
Enzyme induction
increases the

724
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:48,910
rate of metabolism
of the substrates,

725
00:45:48,910 --> 00:45:51,770
reducing bioavailability.

726
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:55,770
CYP enzyme activity
is quite variable

727
00:45:55,770 --> 00:45:58,550
due to pharmacogenetic
variabilities.

728
00:45:59,050 --> 00:46:02,010
These are genetic
polymorphisms,

729
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:05,230
in other words,
switches in the

730
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:11,290
amino acid positions
in the DNA.

731
00:46:11,290 --> 00:46:14,430
So these are genetic
changes that exist

732
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:16,730
in at least 1% of
the human population.

733
00:46:16,730 --> 00:46:24,450
So this is the study
of pharmacogenomics.

734
00:46:33,070 --> 00:46:35,710
Most drugs are excreted
in urine, either

735
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:37,830
as the parent compound,
that is to say the

736
00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:41,790
unchanged drug, active
drug, or as metabolites

737
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:44,270
with polar characteristics.
Minor routes

738
00:46:44,270 --> 00:46:46,850
of excretion include
sweat, saliva, tears,

739
00:46:46,850 --> 00:46:48,910
skin, hair, and
certainly breast milk.

740
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:51,990
Think baby.

741
00:46:55,550 --> 00:46:58,890
The processes
involved in renal

742
00:46:58,890 --> 00:47:00,910
elimination are
glomerular filtration

743
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:04,130
and or active
tubular secretion,

744
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:07,150
passive tubular
reabsorption of

745
00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:09,510
lipophilic drugs,
and then excretion in

746
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:11,770
urine. Only free
drug molecules, those

747
00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:13,870
that are not bound
to plasma proteins,

748
00:47:13,870 --> 00:47:16,070
are filtered by
the glomerulus.

749
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:19,210
The concentration of
drug excreted in urine

750
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:21,330
results from the amount
of drug introduced

751
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:24,670
to the nephrons through
glomerular filtration

752
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:27,910
and secretion in
the proximal tubule,

753
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:31,030
minus the amount
reabsorbed in the distal

754
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:35,190
tubule, and that gets
excreted, obviously.

755
00:47:38,570 --> 00:47:42,070
Interindividual
variations can affect

756
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:44,650
the rate and extent
of drug elimination.

757
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:48,530
Serum creatinine and
creatinine clearance

758
00:47:48,530 --> 00:47:51,590
are biomarkers of
renal function. They

759
00:47:51,590 --> 00:47:54,890
are used to estimate
the glomerular

760
00:47:54,890 --> 00:47:58,190
filtration rate in the
assessment of kidney

761
00:47:58,190 --> 00:48:00,350
function for the
individual patient.

762
00:48:02,070 --> 00:48:05,050
The dose and frequency
of administration

763
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:08,750
required to achieve
therapeutic blood and

764
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:12,070
tissue levels vary
in different patients

765
00:48:12,070 --> 00:48:14,730
because of the individual
differences in drug

766
00:48:14,730 --> 00:48:16,790
distribution, rates
of drug metabolism,

767
00:48:16,790 --> 00:48:20,290
and elimination. These
are determined by

768
00:48:20,290 --> 00:48:23,630
genetic factors and non
-genetic variables such

769
00:48:23,630 --> 00:48:26,970
as age, ***, liver
size, liver function,

770
00:48:27,230 --> 00:48:29,910
circadian rhythm,
body temperature,

771
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:32,190
nutritional,
environmental factors,

772
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:34,830
concomitant
exposure to inducers

773
00:48:34,830 --> 00:48:37,850
or inhibitors of
drug metabolism.

774
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:42,870
Here's why we care.
understanding and

775
00:48:42,870 --> 00:48:45,290
employing pharmacokinetic
principles can

776
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:48,670
increase the probability
of therapeutic

777
00:48:48,670 --> 00:48:52,450
success and reduce the
occurrence of adverse

778
00:48:52,450 --> 00:48:54,610
drug effects in the
body for optimization

779
00:48:54,610 --> 00:48:56,690
of drug therapy
in the individual

780
00:48:56,690 --> 00:49:01,490
patient. Please make
this second nature.

781
00:49:02,130 --> 00:49:06,930
And that concludes
the absorption,

782
00:49:06,930 --> 00:49:09,390
distribution,
metabolism, and excretion

783
00:49:09,390 --> 00:49:12,270
principles of
pharmacokinetics.
