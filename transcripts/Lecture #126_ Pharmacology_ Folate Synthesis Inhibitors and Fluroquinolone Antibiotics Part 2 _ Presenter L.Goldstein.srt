00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,300
Welcome, students,
to our series

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,290
on the pharmacology
of antibiotics.

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,240
This lecture is on
fluoroquinolones.

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,900
Dr. Goldstein speaking.

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,820
Here are the
learning objectives,

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,180
mechanisms, mechanisms,

7
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,280
mechanisms,
pharmacokinetics,

8
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:21,060
mechanisms of
adverse effects,

9
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,560
mechanisms of
drug interactions,

10
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,820
contraindications,

11
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,020
mechanisms,
mechanisms, mechanisms.

12
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,060
Here are some links if

13
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:32,280
you wish to use them.

14
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,520
Here are the key
points about this

15
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,320
class of drugs, the
fluoroquinolones. I

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,570
won't read them to
you. It's here for

17
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:46,040
your use, however
is helpful to you.

18
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,260
So let us begin now. Now,

19
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,880
fluoroquinolones
inhibit bacterial

20
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,580
DNA gyroids and
topoisomerase 4.

21
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,820
I'll go into more
detail on that.

22
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,900
Fluoroquinolones
that are available

23
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,430
in the U.S. are
ciprofloxacin

24
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,700
and the respiratory
fluoroquinolones,

25
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,860
levofloxacin,
moxifloxacin, delafloxacin,

26
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:15,480
olfloxacin. I think
you can see what

27
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,100
the suffix is telling
us about these drugs.

28
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,540
They're all
fluoroquinolones. The

29
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:23,260
definition of a
respiratory fluoroquinolone

30
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:26,460
is one that has
activity against the

31
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,900
respiratory organisms
that cause pneumonia,

32
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,600
including streptococcus
pneumoniae.

33
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:38,620
Nalodixic acid was
the first quinolone,

34
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,540
so naturally it's
called first generation.

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,780
It was highly
effective against

36
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,680
urinary tract
infections, but it

37
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,860
did not achieve
systemic levels.

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,280
The fluoroquinolones

39
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:57,840
overcame that deficiency.

40
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,900
Ofloxacin is not
starred. Its pharmacology

41
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,710
is very similar
to levofloxacin.

42
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,640
Class properties. I
always recommend start

43
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,540
with the class
properties before you

44
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:17,180
ever learn a drug
name. It makes it so

45
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,340
much easier when you
do start to learn the

46
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,560
drug names. You'll
notice that it's just

47
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,240
one or two things
that are different.

48
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,640
The drugs are
taken ****** or can

49
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,000
be administered
IV, rapid complete

50
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,100
absorption from
the GI tract.

51
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,300
However, it's important
not to take mineral

52
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,780
supplements or
antacids because they

53
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:44,140
can complex with
the drugs and reduce

54
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:48,000
absorption as moderate
plasma protein binding

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,120
widely distributed with
high concentrations

56
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:57,240
in tissues and also
they will enter the

57
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:01,120
macrophages and
neutrophils, which is

58
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,980
important when targeting
infections that

59
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:10,180
actually replicate
within our white cells.

60
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:14,120
Renal excretion of
unchanged drugs. So

61
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,060
unchanged drug, we
need to be thinking

62
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:19,940
about adjusting
the dose for renal

63
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:23,080
impairment. So that's
the big picture.

64
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,320
So what are the
clinically relevant drug

65
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,880
-specific pharmacokinetic
properties.

66
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,220
Ciprofloxacin has
hepatic metabolism.

67
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:35,140
Importantly, it is
inhibitor of these CYPs,

68
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,500
1A2, 3A4.

69
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:41,380
The concentration
in urine is variable

70
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:44,080
but generally
high on the high

71
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,160
side, and therefore
the drug is effective

72
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,720
against urinary
tract infections.

73
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:53,620
Levofloxacin, it's
really the class

74
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,160
properties.
Minimal metabolism,

75
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,180
high urine
concentrations.

76
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:03,520
Moxifloxacin, we
see our phase two.

77
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,120
Delafloxacin, phase

78
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,800
two, hepatic metabolism.

79
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,480
Moxifloxacin
actually has fairly

80
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,860
low concentration
of active drug in

81
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,740
urine as compared
to the others.

82
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:25,300
It would be not
preferable compared to the

83
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,680
others for treatment of
urinary tract infections,

84
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,600
which do achieve
high concentrations.

85
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,680
Delafloxacin, certainly
half of it goes into

86
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,620
the urine and half
of it goes into the

87
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:43,620
feces. This is for the
oral form of the drug.

88
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,720
I talk about
clinically relevant

89
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,380
pharmacokinetics,
so let's mention

90
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:56,240
what that actually
means in my mind.

91
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,260
Well, a treatment is
clinically relevant,

92
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,540
just a treatment, if
it provides positive

93
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,280
benefit to how the
patient feels, how the

94
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:09,000
patient functions,
and survival for
life-threatening

95
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:13,880
diseases. It is
the perception of

96
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:20,320
benefit by the patient,
and the drug therapy

97
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,540
outweighs the potential
harm, which is

98
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:28,360
optimization of therapy.
We talked about that in

99
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,620
the early days of our
pharmacology lecture.

100
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:36,420
So, what would
be clinically

101
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,000
relevant pharmacokinetic
properties?

102
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:44,520
These are the
parameters that enable

103
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,740
prescribing the right
drug for the individual

104
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,900
patient at the right
dose by the right route

105
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,900
for the right duration
for optimal efficacy,

106
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:59,580
benefit to the patient,
and minimal harm.

107
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,360
looking at the
ADME parameters

108
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,660
the correct route
of administration

109
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,190
for the desired
effect and

110
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:13,440
patient adherence to
therapy now the correct

111
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,260
route may vary because
if the patient is

112
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:20,700
in the hospital the
patient will is ill

113
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,860
and will likely be
getting the IV at least

114
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:28,560
in the beginning if
the patient is at home,

115
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:32,500
well intravenous
administration is the

116
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:37,400
least favorable for
patient adherence.

117
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:41,180
Oral would probably
be the most favorable.

118
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,900
Does the drug
distribute to the

119
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:47,020
site of action in
the therapeutic

120
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:50,740
concentration? So the
correct dose but not

121
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,660
excessive concentration
which would

122
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,780
increase the risk
of adverse effects.

123
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:59,340
What is the hepatic
function of the patient?

124
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,980
We think about that for
the drug metabolizing

125
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:06,820
capacity, for the
potential for metabolism

126
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,300
and transport-related
drug interactions.

127
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:12,800
What is the
function of the drug

128
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,250
-eliminating organs,
which of course is

129
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,300
hepatic function
for metabolism, I

130
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,600
put it here again,
and the kidney.

131
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,660
All of this information

132
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:29,520
for dosing recommendations
can be looked

133
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,420
up in the literature
when you get to the

134
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,580
point where you need
to be able to do that.

135
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,600
Application of
knowledge can give the

136
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:43,880
prescriber the ability to
anticipate and mitigate

137
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:48,520
potential pharmacokinetics
-related adverse

138
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:53,580
effects and drug
interactions. It helps to

139
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:57,960
provide the right dose
for the right patient

140
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:04,580
and reduce the risk
of adverse effects.

141
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:11,300
pharmacokinetics
pharmacodynamics profile

142
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:16,040
the fluoroquinolones
have a c max to mic

143
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:20,620
or peak to mic
concentration dependent

144
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:24,600
bacterial killing all
of this is in vitro

145
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:29,380
the greater the
concentration the greater

146
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:32,760
the rate and extent
of bacterial killing

147
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,200
The drugs also
have a moderate

148
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,520
persistent bacterial
suppression

149
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,880
after dropping
below the MIC.

150
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:43,860
And efficacy correlates
with the total

151
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,320
amount of drug in
the body at steady

152
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,920
state, the 24-hour
AUC to MIC ratio.

153
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:55,940
The ideal dosing
regimen maximizes

154
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,380
the total amount of drug

155
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,900
administered over
a 24-hour period.

156
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,520
These numbers,
these values,

157
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,020
vary according
to the organism

158
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,480
that's targeted
for treatment.

159
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,660
Again, this
information is

160
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,180
given in the literature.

161
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,120
No need for guessing.

162
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,260
And as you could
imagine, these are

163
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:25,120
bactericidal at these
high concentrations.

164
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,260
Mechanism now. On the
left, we have a model

165
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:35,140
of the formation of
negative DNA supercoils

166
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:39,620
by DNA gyrase, the
function of DNA gyrase.

167
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:44,000
Bacteria have a circular
DNA, so we see that

168
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,890
at the top, and on
the left-hand side,

169
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:50,320
it's shaded more than
on the right-hand side,

170
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,000
and that is a light
green color shading.

171
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:58,680
This circular DNA,
this piece gets brought

172
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:03,560
over, you see that
here, and this is called

173
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,720
a positive super
coil, it's coiled up.

174
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:13,400
The DNA gyrase introduces
a double strand

175
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:17,980
break, which we
see right here, in

176
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,880
order to release the
torsional strain that

177
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,900
comes with this
winding up in front of

178
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:28,480
the replication fork.
This is a generic

179
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:36,000
DNA transcription
here and here's our

180
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,100
topoisomerase and
the winding in front.

181
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:50,780
So once the DNA is
ligated or cleaved,

182
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:58,580
the topoisomerase
then reseals it and we

183
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:03,660
see it now a negative
super coil, and that's

184
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:07,260
going to relieve the
torsional strain.

185
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:11,080
So what do quinolones
do? Quinolones bind

186
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,680
topoisomerase, and they
form this fluoroquinolone

187
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:19,140
-topoisomerase DNA
three-way complex.

188
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:23,360
So they bind all,
and that binding

189
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,260
is going to stall
that replication

190
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:30,280
fork, and it will
prevent this step.

191
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,340
We have the
cleavage, oh excuse

192
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,560
me, it'll prevent
this step.

193
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,940
It will have the
cleavage of the

194
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:44,210
DNA but it won't
have the resealing.

195
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,160
Complexes containing
broken DNA cannot

196
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,980
be resealed. Double
strand breaks in

197
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,460
DNA are generated
and that ultimately

198
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:59,180
leads to the death of
the bacterial cell.

199
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:06,120
Now topoisomerase
4 has a particular

200
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:12,300
function which is to
cause separation of

201
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:15,460
the daughter cells.
So after all of this

202
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:18,060
DNA is replicated
and there will be

203
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,540
two circles kind of
together like this,

204
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:29,480
then topoisomerase 4
will separate them.

205
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,320
So there would be
two daughter cells.

206
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,900
The fluoroquinolones
block that

207
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,780
separation step, which is

208
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,980
called decatenation
by the way.

209
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:48,400
You'll see that
probably on exams,

210
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:53,100
board exams, maybe
NYIT-COM exams.

211
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,140
So it blocks that
separation and

212
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,460
so they can't
separate and

213
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:01,180
therefore proliferation
is blocked.

214
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,060
Apparently what's
been observed in

215
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:14,040
experimentation is that
the DNA gyrase inhibition

216
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:18,540
is more prevalent
in the gram-negative

217
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:24,360
organisms, whereas
the topoisomerase for

218
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,620
inhibition is more
prevalent in the gram

219
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:32,880
-positive. Now,
nearly all bacteria

220
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,750
have both of these
topoisomerase enzymes.

221
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:40,340
It's just a matter
of what the drugs

222
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,740
have better affinity
for, apparently.

223
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,040
The different
affinities of bacterial

224
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,940
topoisomerases
may explain the

225
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,020
differences in
the spectrums of

226
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:55,860
action between these
various strokes.

227
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:02,760
Well, resistance. Not
a surprise to you,

228
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:06,300
I'm sure, that
resistance is common and

229
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:10,780
rates are growing.
There are two major

230
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:15,160
mechanisms, chromosomal
and plasmid associated.

231
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,960
The chromosomal are
the main mechanisms.

232
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:26,150
These include target
modification where the

233
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:32,160
point at which the drug
binds to the DNA is

234
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,480
altered so that the
drug is unable to bind.

235
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:40,050
to that sorry to the
topoisomerase and

236
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:46,220
reduced accumulation
of the drug so efflux

237
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:52,840
we know that bacteria
are able to express

238
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:57,300
efflux pumps against
many drugs and also

239
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,100
for the gram negatives
changes in the

240
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,860
porin structures, so
the drug can't get in.

241
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:07,040
So these, again, I'm
repeating, are the main

242
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,120
mechanisms. They
produce high level

243
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:14,280
resistance. The plasma
mediated mechanisms are

244
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,920
something called
topoprotection, topoisomerase

245
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,720
protection. So it
produces a protein

246
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,760
that protects the site
at which the drug would

247
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:28,000
bind, something called
the QNR proteins.

248
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,660
You can think about
this as quinolone

249
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:35,520
-resistant proteins,
quinolone-resistant

250
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:39,720
proteins, QNR, protecting
that topoisomerase

251
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,500
binding site, and
acetylation of the actual

252
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:48,140
drug that inactivates
it. So these are

253
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:51,740
plasmid-mediated to
repeat, and they do

254
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:55,720
produce low-level
resistance on their own.

255
00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:00,680
In bacteria, mutations
can accumulate.

256
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,400
They can be
combined with other

257
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,000
mechanisms of
resistance, in which case

258
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,280
there will be higher
-level resistance.

259
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:20,430
Troublesome is that
resistance can emerge

260
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:25,170
during therapy among
these common infections,

261
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:27,350
E. coli and other enteric

262
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:29,350
bacteria, pseudomonas,

263
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:31,010
gonorrhea,

264
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:35,570
staphylococci,
and resistance to

265
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:38,910
one is resistance
to the rest. Next,

266
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:43,110
delafloxacin, which was

267
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,850
developed after
the others,

268
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:47,650
seems to be
able to still be

269
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:49,130
resistant, at
least for now.

270
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:53,550
Still remains active,
at least for now.

271
00:16:56,590 --> 00:17:00,310
I put the activity
into this little

272
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:03,570
chart because
I'm hoping that

273
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:05,610
you'll be able
to spot where the

274
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:07,590
differences are
much more easily.

275
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:11,130
Levofloxacin,
moxifloxacin,

276
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:15,810
delofloxacin have
broad-spectrum

277
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:21,770
activity, including
the gram-positive.

278
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:26,030
Ciprofloxacin is
mainly gram-negative.

279
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:27,930
That's an easy way
to think about it.

280
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:33,150
Another thing is
to figure out what

281
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:35,740
are the drug
-specific features.

282
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:42,580
So moxifloxacin is
not active against

283
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:45,010
Pseudomonas, but
the others are.

284
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:50,990
Only delafloxacin has

285
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:53,190
activity against
MRSA, and

286
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,560
that's really about it.

287
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,680
Streptococcus pneumoniae,
H. influenzae,

288
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,840
Morsella catarrhalis,
mycoplasma

289
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,200
pneumoniae, chlamydia
pneumophilia,

290
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,160
chlamytophila
pneumoniae, sorry,

291
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,720
Legionella,

292
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,660
Neisseria meningitidis,

293
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:19,140
various respiratory
pathogens.

294
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,480
The Levomoxy and

295
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,640
Delafloxacin
are all useful.

296
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,420
Ciprofloxacin,
not so much.

297
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:34,440
moxifloxacin is
actually preferred of

298
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,880
the fluoroquinolones
not the preferred

299
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,200
treatment of treatment
of tuberculosis and

300
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,000
of course as with
all tuberculosis

301
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,460
treatments is given
in combination therapy

302
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:49,340
and it is an alternative
that's the way to

303
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:52,280
remember it just
kind of visualize the

304
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,120
chart and see what
the differences are.

305
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,600
Same idea for
empiric therapy

306
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,470
and this is not
a complete list.

307
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,440
Ciprofloxacin
is basically

308
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,240
against gram negatives.

309
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:11,460
Levofloxacin can be
used, if appropriate,

310
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:17,460
in patients for just for
all of these different

311
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:23,820
infections except,
big exception here,

312
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,000
when ciprofloxacin
first came

313
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,940
out it was like
oh great we've

314
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,160
got something
against gonorrhea.

315
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,880
Well not anymore.

316
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,840
Pseudomonas not
moxifloxacin

317
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,440
or delafloxacin.

318
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,500
Pseudomonas
infections mainly

319
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:57,390
because it did
not receive

320
00:19:57,390 --> 00:20:00,930
a FDA indication
for that.

321
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:08,450
Well here we go with
the adverse effects. So

322
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:12,170
we see that all these
drugs seem to be really

323
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:17,470
useful assuming no
resistance. So what's

324
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:20,950
the trouble here? They're
second line. They're

325
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:23,240
not recommended at
all for uncomplicated

326
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:28,630
infections and for more
complicated infections

327
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:31,430
it's important to
consider the patient's

328
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:34,710
risk factors and weigh
the benefit versus

329
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:37,620
the risk when considering
fluoroquinolone

330
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:40,910
therapy. If it's the
right therapy, absolutely

331
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:45,630
use it and just monitor
for adverse effects.

332
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:48,870
Okay, what are they?

333
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:53,670
Potentially permanent
and disabling adverse

334
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:57,250
effects of tendons,
muscles, joints, nerves,

335
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,430
and the CNS. These
can all occur in the

336
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:04,130
same patient at the
same time. And there are

337
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:07,110
several U.S. boxed
warnings known as black

338
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:10,770
box warnings with the
use of fluoroquinolone

339
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,810
seizures, which
fortunately are rare but

340
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:16,210
can occur, increased
intracranial pressure,

341
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:18,710
headache, dizziness,
insomnia, nightmares,

342
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:24,410
depression, psychosis,
peripheral neuropathy,

343
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:26,690
which can be
irreversible. Peripheral

344
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:29,230
neuropathy, we think
about the tingling

345
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:33,950
and numbness in the
fingers and toes.

346
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:36,770
Tendon rupture.

347
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:42,110
This was originally
seen in patients who

348
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:44,730
are also taking
dexamethasone, older

349
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:47,600
patients taking
dexamethasone, together

350
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:52,470
with a fluoroquinolone.
And their Achilles

351
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:55,070
tendon would actually
rupture, either

352
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:57,390
during therapy or
following therapy.

353
00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:04,770
The tendon rupture warning
extends to everyone,

354
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:08,570
and not necessarily
with dexamethasone.

355
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:12,310
But inclusion of
dexamethasone seems

356
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:14,510
to increase the
risk, apparently.

357
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:18,050
And myasthenia
gravis exacerbation

358
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:22,750
because of increased
muscle weakness.

359
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:28,610
Myasthenia gravis is
an autoimmune disease

360
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:35,470
in which the nicotinic
receptors in the

361
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:39,450
neuromuscular junction
are attacked by

362
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:41,310
the immune system.
and that can lead to

363
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:44,570
muscle weakness. And
putting a fluoroquinolone

364
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:48,050
into a patient
who has that can

365
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:51,670
really lead to serious
muscle weakness. So

366
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,590
what do we think about
with muscle weakness?

367
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:56,210
It's serious
respiratory depression.

368
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:01,310
Well, that's not all.

369
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:03,490
Nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, well,

370
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:06,150
that's pretty typical
of all of them.

371
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:09,170
QT interval prolongation.

372
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:12,830
Glucose dysregulation.

373
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:15,130
Diabetic patients
can either

374
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:19,110
suffer hyperglycemia
or serious,

375
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:22,320
possibly deadly
hypoglycemia.

376
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:27,110
Aneurysm or aortic
dissection. C.

377
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:34,570
difficile infection
is associated to a

378
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:36,410
higher degree with
fluoroquinolones

379
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:37,960
than some of the
other antibiotics.

380
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:41,730
phototoxicity and
hypersensitivity

381
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:43,490
reactions as
with everything.

382
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,570
Pregnancy, can we
give these in pregnant

383
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,450
patients? Well
they do cross the

384
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:54,710
placenta, they can be
found in cord blood.

385
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:57,830
There was animal evidence

386
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:00,920
in the beginning of some

387
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:10,650
malformations in
the joints of the

388
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:15,430
infant rodents that
it was tested on but

389
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:17,610
in people over all
these years since

390
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:19,850
the drugs have been
available there have

391
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:22,130
been no specific
teratogenic effect

392
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:25,210
or increased
pregnancy risk

393
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:26,930
identified but
we still have to

394
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:28,590
remember all
those other risks

395
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:33,510
but if it's the
right drug for the

396
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:36,440
patient such as a
person with tuberculosis

397
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,060
or inhalational
anthrax or plague

398
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:43,810
then by all means
it should be used

399
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:45,830
but we have other
drugs for those too

400
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:49,910
adverse effects are
might be increased in

401
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:53,050
the older patient
pediatrics well there

402
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:56,490
are dosing recommendations
available for

403
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:58,990
infants and older
children, adolescents.

404
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:01,950
They're not first
-line agents,

405
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:03,950
especially in pediatric
patients, because

406
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:05,640
of all of these
potential adverse

407
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,110
effects. But if
it's the right drug,

408
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:10,010
then that's what
should be given.

409
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:13,810
Arthralgias and joint
pain during therapy

410
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:16,590
are more common in
children receiving

411
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:20,370
fluoroquinolones
relative to comparator

412
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:23,040
drugs in the studies
that were done.

413
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:29,210
Importantly, long-term
joint abnormalities

414
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:32,530
and growth inhibition
have not been noted.

415
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:41,410
Drug interactions.
I mentioned a few

416
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:46,870
slides ago, CYP1A2
and 3A4 inhibitor.

417
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:53,090
Theophylline is a 1A2
substrate. Theophylline

418
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:56,020
has a narrow
therapeutic window. This

419
00:25:56,020 --> 00:26:00,850
interaction is frequently
seen on practice

420
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:04,070
questions for the
boards. It is important

421
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:07,250
because of theophylline's
narrow therapeutic

422
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:09,810
window. However,
theophylline is not

423
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:13,710
used that much, but
it is still used, and

424
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,310
CYP3A4 substrates
also can be affected.

425
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:22,480
All right, QT
interval prolongation,

426
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:26,290
numerous drugs can
cause this, including

427
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:29,870
the macrolides that
we talked about.

428
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:34,390
Glucocorticoids I mentioned
with the increased

429
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:37,370
risk of tendon
rupture, and antacids

430
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:40,170
and other divalent
cations because of

431
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:44,130
decreased absorption of
the fluoroquinolone. So

432
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:47,640
that's just a separate
by two hours to

433
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:50,250
make sure the drug gets
out of the stomach,

434
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:53,250
out of the gut, and
absorbed before the

435
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:56,390
antacid is given or
the mineral supplement.

436
00:26:57,390 --> 00:27:01,330
So some questions. How
is gaining knowledge

437
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:04,610
about class and drug
-specific pharmacokinetic

438
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:07,410
properties relevant
to optimizing

439
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:09,790
drug therapy for the
individual patient?

440
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:13,030
What parameters
are associated

441
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:15,870
with clinical
efficacy and,

442
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:18,510
importantly, provide
dosing guidance?

443
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,810
What are the bacterial
targets of the

444
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:24,050
fluoroquinolones?
I know, I can hear

445
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:26,310
you in my mind's
ear saying what they

446
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:29,070
are. What are the
chromosomal and

447
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:31,910
plasmid-mediated
resistance mechanisms?

448
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:34,010
Which mechanisms confer

449
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:35,390
low-level resistance?

450
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:38,510
What risks must
be weighed against

451
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:40,090
the benefit
when considering

452
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:42,250
therapy with a
fluoroquinolone?

453
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,100
And here are the answers.

454
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,070
Right drug, right
patient, right

455
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,930
dose, right
route, right time.

456
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:54,310
Right duration of
time. because it

457
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:57,330
provides the practitioner,
the prescriber,

458
00:27:57,330 --> 00:28:00,790
with the ability to
anticipate and mitigate

459
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:03,590
potential
pharmacokinetics-related

460
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:06,530
adverse effects and
drug interactions.

461
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:08,550
So what parameters?

462
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:13,230
CMAX to MIC or
peak to MIC ratio

463
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:16,390
and the AUC24
to MIC ratio.

464
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:19,340
And also the drug
has a moderate

465
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:23,350
post-antibiotic
effect. targets,

466
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:26,390
DNA gyrase and
topoisomerase 4.

467
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:30,390
Chromosomal mutations
in genes for

468
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:34,150
the fluoroquinolone
binding regions,

469
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:36,100
these would be
point mutations.

470
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:40,390
Genes for efflux
pumps, genes for

471
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:43,750
altered porins or
reduced porins.

472
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:48,530
Plasma transfer genes
for the protection

473
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:52,190
protein known as
QNR, or quinolone

474
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:56,650
resistance protection
protein, and also

475
00:28:56,650 --> 00:29:00,550
drug inactivation by
anacetyltransferase.

476
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:07,370
It's the plasma transfer
of genes, those two

477
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:09,590
mechanisms, that
confer the low-level

478
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:13,550
resistance unless they are
coupled with chromosomal

479
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:16,010
resistance mutations
or they accumulate.

480
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:18,890
And significant
toxicities include

481
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:20,550
peripheral
neuropathy, tendon

482
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:23,530
rupture, QT prolongation,
CNS effects.

483
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:28,010
Patient factors at
increased risk of

484
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:30,770
experiencing adverse
effects are older

485
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:33,390
patients, pediatric
patients, pregnant

486
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:36,530
patients, patients
with myasthenia gravis,

487
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:39,650
diabetic patients. And
this is how you can

488
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:44,030
figure out what would
be the cautions and

489
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:51,350
contraindications. How

490
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:59,090
do the adverse
effects, how do

491
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:01,350
the patient's
organ functions

492
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:05,850
relate to the
adverse effects?

493
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:13,530
And now in summary,
pharmacokinetics,

494
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:18,310
good oral
bioavailability, antacids,

495
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:22,790
multivalent cations
will complex with them.

496
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:26,490
********* high concentrations
in body tissues,

497
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:29,190
most body tissues,
high concentrations

498
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:32,070
in urine, except
moxifloxacin, not so much.

499
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:35,210
Efficacy is
associated with a peak

500
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:42,370
-to-mic ratio, 24-hour
AUC to MIC ratio,

501
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:44,710
and the post
-antibiotic effects.

502
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:48,430
The drugs, the
fluoroquinolones, inhibit

503
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:52,370
DNA gyrase and topoisomerase
4. This introduces

504
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:56,530
strand breaks and cell
death. In addition

505
00:30:56,530 --> 00:31:00,990
of topo4 prevents
decatenation. They are

506
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:04,130
bactericidal at those
high concentrations.

507
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:06,770
They're concentration
dependent killing.

508
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:09,730
Chromosomally mediated
resistance point

509
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:13,210
mutations in the
topoisomerases is

510
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:15,850
where the fluoroquinolones
bind. Reduced

511
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:19,230
intracellular
accumulation. And then

512
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:21,670
plasmid mediated,
which is the

513
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:26,030
topoprotection protein,
QNR, and acetylase.

514
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:30,250
Ciprofloxacin is
active against the gram

515
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:32,430
-negative aerobic
bacteria, including

516
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:35,690
pseudomonas. Moderate
activity against

517
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:38,510
gram Positives, it's
hardly used for that

518
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:41,010
because so many other
drugs are better.

519
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:46,210
Levofloxacin, Moxie,
Della, O-floxacin,

520
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:48,710
they're all respiratory
fluoroquinolones

521
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:51,430
because they are
active against the

522
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:55,030
atypicals and
streptococcus pneumoniae.

523
00:31:56,950 --> 00:32:00,940
Levofloxacin has good
gram-negative bacteria

524
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:05,770
spectrum also,
including pseudomonas.

525
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:09,650
I didn't say it before,
it isn't necessary

526
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:12,250
for you to memorize
it, but levofloxacin is

527
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:14,700
good, given once a day
for most infections.

528
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:20,130
Moxifloxacin,
improved gram

529
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:22,530
-positive activity,
reduced activity

530
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:24,630
against gram
-negative bacteria,

531
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:28,470
and I didn't
specifically mention it

532
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:33,530
before, but it's on
the chart. it has

533
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:36,550
anaerobic activity
it is the only one

534
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:40,350
with anaerobic bacteria
i mean activity

535
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:46,600
and

536
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:52,200
it is effective
against anaerobic lung

537
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:56,680
infections it does not
have activity against

538
00:32:56,680 --> 00:33:00,080
bacteroides but it is
useful for lung infections

539
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,340
like abscess and
anaerobic infections

540
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:06,680
delafloxacin is a
respiratory fluoroquinolone

541
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:10,220
that's also got activity
against MRSA. It's

542
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:13,160
the only one in the
fluoroquinolones group.

543
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,360
It has been approved
by the FDA for

544
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,780
acute bacterial skin
and skin structure

545
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:25,780
infections and caused
by aerobic gram

546
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:29,080
positives, MRSA,
and it's also useful

547
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:32,260
for community
acquired pneumonia and

548
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:35,560
that's indicated on
the chart earlier.

549
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,740
Toxicities, a number
of safety alerts,

550
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,560
a number of cautions,

551
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:45,780
CNS effects,
peripheral neuropathy,

552
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,700
tendonitis, tendon
rupture, worsening

553
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,280
of myasthenia gravis,
muscle weakness,

554
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:54,140
QT, interval
prolongation,

555
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,820
hypersensitivity
reactions.

556
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:00,930
Use in Pregnancy,
only if the benefit

557
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:02,960
outweighs the
risk, and these are

558
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,860
some serious
infections listed here.

559
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:08,880
Multidrug-resistant
tuberculosis,

560
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,940
inhalational anthrax,

561
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,640
plague.

562
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,880
Pediatrics,

563
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:17,520
again, if
benefit outweighs

564
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,080
risk. Older patient,

565
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:22,500
again, if benefit
outweighs risk, and

566
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,740
the risk of adverse
effects tends

567
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:27,300
to be increased in
the older patient.

568
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,360
Drug interactions,
we have

569
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:32,880
ciprofloxacin, CYPs, 1A2.

570
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,820
Please do remember that
theophylline toxicity

571
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:38,260
risk. It keeps coming
up over and over.

572
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,920
And 3A4.

573
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:44,420
And it just so happens
there are organic

574
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:48,170
anion transport
-related interactions

575
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:51,560
also listed in the
drug monograph.

576
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,880
All fluoroquinolones
prolong the QT

577
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,100
interval. They
should not be given

578
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,560
with glucocorticoids
because they can

579
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:02,440
increase the risk
of tendon rupture.

580
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:06,000
And diantrivalent
cations will reduce

581
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,640
the absorption
from the GI tract.

582
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:12,420
And here are the
answers. I hope

583
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,920
you looked at
the questions and

584
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,040
tried to answer
them yourself first.

585
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,180
And that concludes the

586
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,530
lecture on
fluoroquinolones.
