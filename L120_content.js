# Pharmacology: Antimicrobial Agents I - Cell Wall Synthesis Inhibitors

## Introduction to Beta-Lactam Antibiotics
*   **Classes:** Penicillins, Cephalosporins, Carbapenems, Monobactams.
*   **Structure:** All contain a **beta-lactam ring** essential for antibacterial activity.
    *   R-group side chains determine pharmacokinetics and spectrum.
*   **Mechanism of Action:**
    *   **Target:** Penicillin-Binding Proteins (**PBPs**), which are **transpeptidases** involved in the final step of peptidoglycan synthesis (cross-linking).
    *   **Action:** Bind to PBPs $\\rightarrow$ Block cross-linking of peptidoglycan $\\rightarrow$ Trigger **autolysins** $\\rightarrow$ Cell wall degradation and osmotic rupture.
    *   **Effect:** **Bactericidal** (only against actively growing bacteria).
*   **PK/PD Parameter:** **Time > MIC** (Time-dependent killing).
    *   Goal: Maintain drug concentration above MIC for a significant portion of the dosing interval.
    *   Minimal persistent effects (post-antibiotic effect).

## Mechanisms of Resistance (The "6 Ps")
1.  **Penicillinases (Beta-lactamases):** Enzymes that cleave the beta-lactam ring, inactivating the drug.
    *   Major mechanism for *Staphylococcus aureus* and Gram-negative bacilli.
2.  **PBPs (Altered Target):** Mutation in PBPs leads to low affinity for the drug.
    *   **MRSA:** *mecA* gene encodes **PBP2a** (low affinity for all beta-lactams except 5th gen cephalosporins).
    *   *Streptococcus pneumoniae*: Altered PBPs.
    *   *Enterococcus*: Altered PBPs.
3.  **Porins:** Reduced permeability in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria prevents drug entry.
4.  **Pumps:** Efflux pumps actively transport drug out of the cell.
5.  **Penetration:** Inability to reach intracellular pathogens or penetrate biofilms.
6.  **Peptidoglycan:** Absence of cell wall (e.g., *Mycoplasma*, *Chlamydia* - "Atypicals").

## Pharmacokinetics of Beta-Lactams
*   **Absorption:** Variable oral absorption (Pen V > Pen G; Amoxicillin > Ampicillin).
*   **Distribution:**
    *   Widely distributed in body fluids and tissues.
    *   **Poor CNS penetration** *unless* meninges are inflamed (meningitis increases permeability).
    *   Poor penetration into eye (vitreous) and prostate.
*   **Elimination:**
    *   Most are eliminated **renally** (glomerular filtration + tubular secretion).
    *   **Exceptions (Hepatic):** **Nafcillin**, **Oxacillin**, **Dicloxacillin**, **Ceftriaxone**.
*   **Half-life:** Generally short ($< 2$ hours), requiring frequent dosing.

## Adverse Effects
*   **Hypersensitivity (Most Important):**
    *   **Type I (IgE-mediated):** Anaphylaxis, angioedema, urticaria, bronchoconstriction, hypotension. Treat with **Epinephrine**.
    *   **Severe Skin Reactions:** Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN).
    *   **Serum Sickness (Type III):** Delayed fever, rash, arthralgia.
    *   **Immunohemolysis:** Hapten formation on RBCs $\\rightarrow$ Hemolytic anemia.
    *   **Cross-reactivity:** Significant between Penicillins and Cephalosporins (related to side chain similarity).
*   **Neurologic:** **Seizures** (at high doses, especially with renal failure).
*   **GI:** Diarrhea, Nausea, Vomiting. Risk of *C. difficile* colitis.
*   **Renal:** Interstitial Nephritis (classic with Methicillin, rare with others).
*   **Hematologic:** Leukopenia, Thrombocytopenia (with long-term use).
*   **Jarisch-Herxheimer Reaction:** Acute febrile reaction after starting treatment for **Syphilis** (*Treponema pallidum*). Due to release of pyrogens from dying spirochetes. Not an allergy.
*   **Non-Allergic Rash:** Maculopapular rash with **Aminopenicillins** (Ampicillin/Amoxicillin) in patients with **Mononucleosis** (EBV) or taking **Allopurinol**.

## Drug Interactions
*   **Probenicid:** Inhibits renal tubular secretion of penicillins $\\rightarrow$ **Increases** plasma levels and half-life (beneficial interaction).
*   **Oral Contraceptives:** Potential reduced efficacy due to disruption of enterohepatic circulation of estrogen (caution advised).
*   **Tetracyclines:** Bacteriostatic drugs antagonize bactericidal beta-lactams.
*   **Warfarin:** Potential increased bleeding risk (via gut flora alteration affecting Vitamin K).

## Classification of Penicillins

### 1. Natural Penicillins
*   **Drugs:** **Penicillin G** (IV/IM), **Penicillin V** (Oral), **Benzathine Penicillin G** (IM Depot).
*   **Spectrum:** **Narrow**.
    *   **Gram-Positive:** *Streptococcus* species (Group A, B, Viridans), *Enterococcus* (bacteriostatic).
    *   **Spirochetes:** ***Treponema pallidum*** (Syphilis).
    *   **Gram-Negative:** ***Neisseria meningitidis***.
*   **Resistance:** *Staphylococcus* (penicillinase), most Gram-negatives.
*   **Clinical Use:** Syphilis (Benzathine Pen G), Strep throat, Meningococcal meningitis.

### 2. Penicillinase-Resistant Penicillins (Anti-Staphylococcal)
*   **Drugs:** **Nafcillin** (IV), **Oxacillin** (IV), **Dicloxacillin** (Oral). (Methicillin - withdrawn).
*   **Spectrum:** **Very Narrow**.

*   **PK:** **Hepatic elimination** (No renal adjustment needed).
*   **Clinical Use:** MSSA infections (Endocarditis, Skin/Soft tissue, Osteomyelitis).

### 3. Aminopenicillins (Extended Spectrum)
*   **Drugs:** **Ampicillin** (IV/Oral), **Amoxicillin** (Oral).

            question: "Which mechanism of resistance renders Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) resistant to nearly all beta-lactam antibiotics?",
            options: [
                "Production of beta-lactamase (penicillinase)",
                "Alteration of Penicillin-Binding Protein (PBP2a)",

                "Porin channel mutation"
            ],
            answer: 1,
            explanation: "MRSA resistance is due to the *mecA* gene encoding an altered Penicillin-Binding Protein (PBP2a) that has a very low affinity for beta-lactam antibiotics. This renders it resistant to penicillins, cephalosporins (except 5th gen), and carbapenems. Beta-lactamase production is the mechanism for MSSA resistance to natural penicillins."

            ],
            answer: 2,
            explanation: "This is the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction, an acute febrile reaction that occurs shortly after starting treatment for spirochetal infections (like Syphilis). It is caused by the release of endotoxin-like substances from dying spirochetes. It is self-limiting and not an allergic reaction."

            question: "What is the primary purpose of adding Probenicid to Penicillin therapy?",
            options: [
                "To enhance bactericidal activity",
                "To prevent hypersensitivity reactions",

                "To expand the spectrum to Gram-negatives"
            ],
            answer: 2,
            explanation: "Probenicid inhibits the organic anion transporter in the renal proximal tubule, blocking the secretion of penicillins. This increases their plasma concentration and prolongs their half-life."

            ],
            answer: 1,
            explanation: "*Enterococcus* species are intrinsically resistant to all cephalosporins because their PBPs do not bind cephalosporins effectively. (Note: This fact is often emphasized in beta-lactam lectures, though covered more in the Cephalosporin section, it's a key concept for cell wall inhibitors)."
