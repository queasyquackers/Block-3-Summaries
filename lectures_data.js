* **Slide 4-5:** Orbital septum; Blowout fractures into ethmoidal/maxillary sinuses
:::

### The Orbital Environment and Adipose Tissue

The orbit is best conceptualized as a **pyramidal structure** with its apex pointing posteriorly and its base facing anteriorly. A critical anatomical feature often overlooked in textbook diagrams is the abundance of **adipose tissue** within the orbit. On T2-weighted MRI imaging, this orbital fat appears bright white, reflecting the high water content of adipose tissue.

This adipose tissue functions biomechanically as a **non-compressible fluid**. When blunt force trauma is applied to the eye—such as from a fist, ball, or automobile accident—the intra-orbital pressure increases dramatically. Since fluids cannot be compressed, this pressure must be dissipated elsewhere. The orbital walls provide resistance, but two specific walls are anatomically vulnerable: the **medial wall** (lamina papyracea of the ethmoid) and the **floor** (maxilla). These bones are remarkably thin, often described as "paper-thin."

:::clinical
**Clinical Correlate: Blowout Fractures**

When high intra-orbital pressure exceeds the structural integrity of the thin medial wall or floor, a **blowout fracture** occurs. Orbital contents—including adipose tissue, extraocular muscles (most commonly the **inferior rectus** or **medial rectus**), nerves, and blood vessels—can herniate into the adjacent paranasal sinuses (ethmoid or maxillary sinuses).

**Clinical Signs:**
- **Enophthalmos**: The eye appears sunken due to loss of orbital volume
- **Diplopia**: Double vision from muscle entrapment or nerve damage
- **Infraorbital nerve dysfunction**: Numbness of the cheek, upper lip, and teeth on the affected side
- **Restriction of eye movements**: Especially upward gaze if the inferior rectus is trapped

**Management**: Often requires surgical repair to release entrapped structures and restore orbital anatomy.
:::

### Bony Architecture of the Orbit

The orbit is composed of **seven bones** arranged into four walls:

| Wall | Primary Bones | Additional Contributors | Clinical Significance |
|------|--------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| **Roof (Superior)** | Frontal bone | Lesser wing of sphenoid (posterior) | Forms floor of anterior cranial fossa |
| **Floor (Inferior)** | Maxilla | Zygomatic bone (lateral), Palatine bone (medial) | **Thinnest wall**, prone to blowout fractures |
| **Medial Wall** | Ethmoid (lamina papyracea) | Frontal, Lacrimal, Sphenoid | **Extremely thin**, prone to blowout fractures |
| **Lateral Wall** | Greater wing of sphenoid | Zygomatic bone (anterior) | **Strongest wall**, provides protection |

### The Orbital Septum

The anterior opening of the orbit is closed by a tough fibrous membrane called the **orbital septum**. This structure extends from the orbital rim and blends with the tarsal plates of the eyelids. The orbital septum creates a relatively **rigid compartment** around the orbital contents.

:::clinical
**Clinical Correlate: Orbital Compartment Syndrome**

Because the orbit is a rigid, enclosed space (analogous to compartment syndrome in the limbs), any process that increases orbital volume—such as **retrobulbar hemorrhage** following trauma—can lead to a rapid and dangerous increase in intraorbital pressure.

**Clinical Emergency:** This can compress the optic nerve and central retinal artery, leading to **irreversible blindness** within 90-120 minutes.

**Emergency Intervention:** Lateral canthotomy and cantholysis may be performed to decompress the orbit by cutting the lateral palpebral ligament, allowing orbital contents to expand anteriorly and relieving pressure on the optic nerve.

* **Slide 6:** Levator Palpebrae Superioris (LPS) and Müller's muscle
* **Slide 7-8:** Recti muscles origin (Common Tendinous Ring) and insertion
* **Slide 9-10:** Oblique muscles (Superior via trochlea, Inferior)
* **Slide 11:** Innervation mnemonic (SO4 LR6 AO3)
:::

### The Seven Extraocular Muscles

There are **seven muscles** that control eye and eyelid movement:

1. **Levator Palpebrae Superioris (LPS)** - Elevates the upper eyelid
2. **Superior Rectus** - Primary elevator of the eye
3. **Inferior Rectus** - Primary depressor of the eye
4. **Medial Rectus** - Adducts the eye (moves it medially)
5. **Lateral Rectus** - Abducts the eye (moves it laterally)
6. **Superior Oblique** - Depresses, intorts, and abducts the eye
7. **Inferior Oblique** - Elevates, extorts, and abducts the eye

### Origins and Insertions

#### The Common Tendinous Ring (Annulus of Zinn)

The four **rectus muscles** (superior, inferior, medial, lateral) all originate from a fibrous ring at the **orbital apex** called the **common tendinous ring** or **annulus of Zinn**. This ring surrounds the optic foramen and part of the superior orbital fissure.

From this common origin, each rectus muscle travels forward and inserts into the **sclera** just posterior to the corneoscleral junction. The insertions form a spiral pattern known as the **Spiral of Tillaux**.

#### Levator Palpebrae Superioris

- **Origin**: Lesser wing of the sphenoid (orbital apex)
- **Insertion**: Superior tarsus and skin of the upper eyelid
- **Special Feature**: Contains smooth muscle fibers (**Müller's muscle** or superior tarsal muscle) innervated by **sympathetic nerves**

:::clinical
**Clinical Correlate: Horner's Syndrome**

Disruption of sympathetic innervation to the head and neck results in **Horner's syndrome**, characterized by:
- **Ptosis**: Mild drooping of the upper eyelid (from loss of Müller's muscle tone)
- **Miosis**: Constricted pupil (from unopposed parasympathetic tone)
- **Anhidrosis**: Loss of sweating on the ipsilateral face

This can be caused by lesions anywhere along the sympathetic pathway, including lung tumors (**Pancoast tumor**), carotid dissection, or brainstem strokes.
:::

#### Superior Oblique

- **Origin**: Lesser wing of the sphenoid (medial to the common tendinous ring)
- **Course**: Travels anteriorly along the medial orbital wall, passes through a **fibrous pulley** called the **trochlea** (located on the anteromedial roof of the orbit), then turns posterolaterally
- **Insertion**: Superior-lateral surface of the sclera, **deep** to the superior rectus

The trochlea acts as a **functional fulcrum**, redirecting the muscle's line of pull and giving it unique biomechanical properties.

#### Inferior Oblique

- **Origin**: **Maxilla** (orbital floor, near the medial orbital rim) - **UNIQUE**: Only extraocular muscle that does NOT originate from the orbital apex
- **Course**: Travels laterally and posteriorly beneath the eye
- **Insertion**: Inferior-lateral surface of the sclera, **deep** to the lateral rectus

### Innervation: The SO₄LR₆AO₃ Rule

The innervation of extraocular muscles follows a simple mnemonic formula:

**SO₄LR₆AO₃**

- **SO₄**: **Superior Oblique** is innervated by **Cranial Nerve IV** (Trochlear nerve)
- **LR₆**: **Lateral Rectus** is innervated by **Cranial Nerve VI** (Abducens nerve)
- **AO₃**: **All Others** (Medial Rectus, Superior Rectus, Inferior Rectus, Inferior Oblique, and Levator Palpebrae Superioris) are innervated by **Cranial Nerve III** (Oculomotor nerve)

| Muscle | Cranial Nerve | Functional Division |
|--------|--------------|---------------------|
| Superior Oblique | CN IV (Trochlear) | General Somatic Efferent (GSE) |
| Lateral Rectus | CN VI (Abducens) | General Somatic Efferent (GSE) |
| Medial Rectus | CN III (Oculomotor) | General Somatic Efferent (GSE) |
| Superior Rectus | CN III (Oculomotor) | General Somatic Efferent (GSE) |
| Inferior Rectus | CN III (Oculomotor) | General Somatic Efferent (GSE) |
| Inferior Oblique | CN III (Oculomotor) | General Somatic Efferent (GSE) |
| Levator Palpebrae Superioris | CN III (Oculomotor) | General Somatic Efferent (GSE) |

## Part 3: Biomechanics of Eye Movement - Action vs. Function

:::slides 12-18
* **Slide 12-13:** Axes of rotation (Orbit axis vs Visual axis)
* **Slide 14-16:** Actions of Recti muscles in abducted vs adducted positions
* **Slide 17-18:** Complex movements in primary position (cancellation of torsion)
:::

### Understanding Axes of Rotation

A critical concept in ocular biomechanics is the distinction between a muscle's **action** (what it would do in isolation) and its **function** (what it actually contributes in vivo).

This complexity arises because the **orbital axis** (the line running anteroposteriorly through the center of the orbit) is angled approximately **23 degrees** laterally from the midline, while the **visual axis** (the line of sight when looking straight ahead) is directed straight forward.

In **primary position** (looking straight ahead), these two axes are misaligned. As a result, single muscles produce **complex movements** combining:
- Horizontal rotation (adduction/abduction)
- Vertical rotation (elevation/depression)
- Torsional rotation (intorsion/extorsion)

### Muscle Actions in Different Gaze Positions

#### In the Abducted Position (Eye Looking Laterally)

When the eye is **abducted** (looking to the side), the visual axis aligns with the pulling direction of the **rectus muscles**. This simplifies their actions:

- **Superior Rectus**: Pure **elevation**
- **Inferior Rectus**: Pure **depression**

#### In the Adducted Position (Eye Looking Medially)

When the eye is **adducted** (looking toward the nose), the visual axis aligns with the pulling direction of the **oblique muscles**:

- **Inferior Oblique**: Pure **elevation**
- **Superior Oblique**: Pure **depression**

### Movement in Primary Position: Synergistic Muscle Pairing

When the eyes are in primary position (looking straight ahead), and you want to look up or down, **paired muscles** work together to cancel out unwanted torsional movements while achieving smooth vertical displacement:

| Desired Movement | Primary Agonist | Synergist | Mechanism of Coordination |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------|--------------------------|
| **Elevation** | Superior Rectus | Inferior Oblique | SR produces intorsion; IO produces extorsion → Torsion cancels → Pure elevation |
| **Depression** | Inferior Rectus | Superior Oblique | IR produces extorsion; SO produces intorsion → Torsion cancels → Pure depression |

This is a beautiful example of **neuromotor coordination**, where the central nervous system orchestrates precise ratios of muscle contraction to achieve the desired eye movement.

## Part 4: Clinical Testing and Cranial Nerve Lesions

:::slides 19-24
* **Slide 19-20:** The "H" Test pattern
* **Slide 21:** CN III Palsy ("Down and Out", Ptosis)
* **Slide 22-23:** CN IV Palsy (Bielschowsky's sign/Head tilt)
* **Slide 24:** Summary of torsion and muscle testing
:::

### The "H" Test

To clinically assess the function of individual extraocular muscles and their corresponding cranial nerves, clinicians use the **"H" test** (also called the "six cardinal directions of gaze").

The patient is asked to follow the examiner's finger as it traces an "H" pattern in space. This deliberately places the eye in positions where **function equals action**—allowing each muscle to be tested in isolation.

### Cranial Nerve Palsies

:::clinical
**Clinical Correlate: Oculomotor Nerve (CN III) Palsy**

**CN III** innervates five extraocular muscles plus the levator palpebrae superioris. A complete third nerve palsy results in striking clinical findings:

**Motor Deficits:**
- **"Down and Out" position**: The only functional muscles are the lateral rectus (CN VI) and superior oblique (CN IV), which pull the eye down and laterally
- **Complete ptosis**: Paralysis of levator palpebrae superioris causes the eyelid to droop completely
- **Loss of all other eye movements**: Cannot look up, down (except via SO), or medially

**Parasympathetic Deficits** (if the lesion affects parasympathetic fibers running on the surface of CN III):
- **Mydriasis**: Dilated pupil from loss of parasympathetic innervation to the sphincter pupillae
- **Loss of accommodation**: Cannot focus on near objects

**Causes**: Posterior communicating artery aneurysm (compresses CN III), uncal herniation, cavernous sinus lesions, diabetes (spares pupil)

**Critical Decision**: A "blown pupil" (dilated and non-reactive) with CN III palsy suggests **compressive lesion** (like aneurysm) and requires **emergency neuroimaging**.
:::

:::clinical
**Clinical Correlate: Trochlear Nerve (CN IV) Palsy**

**CN IV** innervates only the superior oblique muscle. This is the **most commonly injured cranial nerve** due to trauma because of its long, delicate intracranial course around the brainstem.

**Clinical Findings:**
- **Vertical diplopia**: Double vision that worsens when looking down and toward the nose (e.g., reading, walking downstairs)
- **Difficulty with depression in adduction**: Cannot look down when the eye is turned inward
- **Compensatory head tilt**: Patient tilts head **away** from the affected side to minimize diplopia

**Bielschowsky's Head Tilt Test**: Tilting the head toward the affected side worsens diplopia; tilting away improves it.

**Causes**: Trauma (most common), microvascular disease (diabetes, hypertension), congenital
:::

:::clinical
**Clinical Correlate: Abducens Nerve (CN VI) Palsy**

**CN VI** innervates only the lateral rectus muscle.

**Clinical Findings:**
- **Inability to abduct the eye**: Cannot look laterally on the affected side
- **Esotropia**: The affected eye deviates medially (toward the nose) due to unopposed medial rectus tone
- **Horizontal diplopia**: Double vision that worsens when looking toward the affected side

**Causes**: 
- **Increased intracranial pressure** (CN VI has the longest intracranial course and can be compressed against the petrous ridge)
- Microvascular disease
- Cavernous sinus lesions
- Pontine lesions

**False localizing sign**: CN VI palsy can occur with increased ICP from any cause, so it doesn't necessarily indicate a local lesion.

        questions: `**1. A 28-year-old male presents to the emergency department 2 hours after being punched in the right eye during a fight. Physical examination reveals enophthalmos of the right eye, numbness of the right cheek, and pain with upward gaze. A CT scan confirms a fracture of the orbital floor with herniation of orbital contents into the maxillary sinus. Which structure is most likely entrapped, causing limitation of upward gaze?**

A. Superior rectus muscle  
B. Inferior rectus muscle  
C. Medial rectus muscle  
D. Inferior oblique muscle  
E. Levator palpebrae superioris

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to Reveal Answer</strong></summary>

**Answer: B (Inferior rectus muscle)**

**Rationale**: In a blowout fracture of the orbital floor, the **inferior rectus muscle** is the most commonly entrapped structure as orbital contents herniate inferiorly into the maxillary sinus. Entrapment of the inferior rectus prevents the eye from looking upward because the muscle becomes mechanically restricted. The superior rectus (A) would not be entrapped in a floor fracture. The medial rectus (C) would be associated with a medial wall fracture. The inferior oblique (D) originates from the orbital floor near where fractures occur, but the inferior rectus is more commonly trapped. Levator palpebrae superioris (E) is located superiorly and would not be affected by a floor fracture.

The infraorbital nerve also runs along the orbital floor, explaining the numbness in the cheek (infraorbital nerve distribution).

**2. A 55-year-old woman with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus presents with sudden onset of double vision. On examination, her right eye is deviated "down and out," she has complete ptosis of the right eyelid, and her right pupil is 3 mm and reactive to light (left pupil is also 3 mm). Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?**

A. Right CN III palsy due to compressive aneurysm  
B. Right CN III palsy due to microvascular ischemia  
C. Right CN IV palsy  
D. Right CN VI palsy  
E. Myasthenia gravis

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to Reveal Answer</strong></summary>

**Answer: B (Right CN III palsy due to microvascular ischemia)**

**Rationale**: This patient has classic findings of oculomotor nerve (CN III) palsy: "down and out" position due to unopposed action of lateral rectus (CN VI) and superior oblique (CN IV), and complete ptosis from levator palpebrae superioris paralysis. The **key distinguishing feature** is that her pupil is normal and reactive.

In **microvascular ischemic CN III palsy** (common in diabetics), the ischemia affects the core of the nerve where motor fibers run, but **spares** the parasympathetic pupillomotor fibers that run on the surface of the nerve (better vascular supply from pial vessels). This results in a "pupil-sparing" third nerve palsy.

In contrast, a **compressive lesion** like a posterior communicating artery aneurysm (A) would compress the nerve from outside, affecting the superficial parasympathetic fibers **first**, resulting in a **dilated, non-reactive pupil** ("blown pupil"). This would be a neurosurgical emergency.

CN IV palsy (C) would not cause the "down and out" position or ptosis. CN VI palsy (D) causes medial deviation (esotropia), not "down and out." Myasthenia gravis (E) typically causes variable, fatigable weakness and would not explain the consistent "down and out" position.

**Clinical Pearl**: Pupil-sparing CN III palsy in a diabetic = medical management. Pupil-involved CN III palsy = emergency imaging for aneurysm.

**3. A 32-year-old patient who was involved in a motor vehicle accident 3 hours ago develops severe right eye pain, proptosis, and rapidly deteriorating vision in the right eye. Examination shows a tense orbit, and the intraocular pressure is measured at 45 mmHg (normal: 10-21 mmHg). What is the most appropriate immediate management?**

A. Administer IV mannitol and observe  
B. Perform immediate lateral canthotomy and cantholysis  
C. Order an urgent CT scan before any intervention  
D. Administer topical timolol and dorzolamide  
E. Consult ophthalmology and wait for OR availability

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to Reveal Answer</strong></summary>

**Answer: B (Perform immediate lateral canthotomy and cantholysis)**

**Rationale**: This patient has **orbital compartment syndrome** (retrobulbar hemorrhage), a true ophthalmologic emergency. Blood accumulating in the rigid orbital compartment compresses the optic nerve and central retinal artery, leading to **irreversible blindness** within 90-120 minutes if not decompressed.

**Immediate lateral canthotomy and cantholysis** is a bedside procedure that cuts the lateral canthal tendon and inferior crus of the lateral canthal ligament, allowing the globe to move anteriorly and decompress the orbit. This is a **time-is-vision emergency** that takes precedence over imaging.

IV mannitol (A) may help reduce some pressure but is insufficient alone and delays definitive treatment. Obtaining CT first (C) wastes precious time; diagnosis is clinical. Topical glaucoma medications (D) are inappropriate—this is not primary glaucoma but compression-induced elevated pressure. Waiting for OR/ophthalmology (E) risks permanent vision loss.

**Key Concept**: Orbital compartment syndrome requires **immediate bedside decompression**; the motto is "**see a problem, do canthotomy**."

**4. A 6-year-old child is brought to the clinic by parents who notice the child has been tilting their head to the right shoulder for several months. Ophthalmologic examination reveals vertical diplopia that worsens when the child looks down and to the left. The diplopia improves when the head is tilted to the left. Which cranial nerve is most likely affected?**

A. Right oculomotor nerve (CN III)  
B. Left oculomotor nerve (CN III)  
C. Right trochlear nerve (CN IV)  
D. Left trochlear nerve (CN IV)  
E. Right abducens nerve (CN VI)

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to Reveal Answer</strong></summary>

**Answer: D (Left trochlear nerve (CN IV))**

**Rationale**: This child has a classic presentation of **superior oblique palsy** (trochlear nerve palsy). The superior oblique is the primary depressor when the eye is adducted (looking toward the nose). Loss of this function causes:

- **Vertical diplopia** that worsens when looking down and toward the nose (down and to the left suggests left eye problem)
- **Compensatory head tilt AWAY from the affected side** to minimize diplopia (tilting right suggests left side affected)

**Bielschowsky's Head Tilt Test**: Tilting the head toward the affected side worsens diplopia; tilting away improves it. This patient tilts to the right (away from the left side), and tilting to the left (toward the affected side) would worsen diplopia.

CN III palsy (A, B) would cause "down and out" position and ptosis, not isolated vertical diplopia. CN VI palsy (E) causes horizontal diplopia, not vertical.

**Note**: Congenital CN IV palsy is common and often presents with long-standing head tilt that parents may notice in childhood photos.

**5. During an orbital floor fracture repair surgery, the surgeon must identify the inferior oblique muscle. Which of the following best describes the origin of this muscle?**

A. Common tendinous ring at the orbital apex  
B. Lesser wing of the sphenoid bone  
C. Maxillary bone on the anteromedial orbital floor  
D. Greater wing of the sphenoid bone  
E. Zygomatic bone

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to Reveal Answer</strong></summary>

**Answer: C (Maxillary bone on the anteromedial orbital floor)**

**Rationale**: The **inferior oblique** is unique among the extraocular muscles in that it is the **only one that does NOT originate from the orbital apex**. Instead, it originates from the **maxillary bone** on the **orbital floor**, specifically near the anteromedial corner close to the orbit rim (near the lacrimal fossa).

The inferior oblique then courses laterally and posteriorly to insert on the inferolateral aspect of the globe, passing beneath the inferior rectus.

The common tendinous ring (A) is the origin of the four rectus muscles and levator palpebrae superioris. The lesser wing of the sphenoid (B) is the origin of the superior oblique (before it passes through the trochlea). The greater wing of the sphenoid (D) contributes to the lateral orbital wall but is not an origin for extraocular muscles. The zygomatic bone (E) forms part of the lateral orbital rim and wall.

**Clinical Pearl**: In orbital floor fractures, both the inferior rectus and inferior oblique can be affected due to their anatomic proximity to the fracture site.

        summary: `# Lecture #128: Pathology of Cellular Adaptation and Cellular Injury

**Lecturer:** Maria M. Plummer, M.D.
**Session:** Lecture #128

-----

## Part 1: Cellular Adaptations

:::slides 7-17
* **Slide 7:** Hypertrophy (increased size)
* **Slide 17:** Hyperplasia (increased number)
:::

Cells are constantly exposed to stress. To survive, they must adapt. If the stress is excessive or the cell cannot adapt, injury occurs.

### Hypertrophy
**Hypertrophy** is an increase in the **size** of cells, leading to an increase in the size of the organ. It occurs in tissues that cannot divide (permanent tissues like cardiac and skeletal muscle).
*   **Physiologic:** Uterus during pregnancy, skeletal muscle in bodybuilders.
*   **Pathologic:** Cardiac hypertrophy in hypertension (left ventricle works harder against resistance).
*   **Mechanism:** Mechanical sensors and growth factors activate signaling pathways (PI3K/AKT, GPCRs) -> increased protein synthesis.

### Hyperplasia
**Hyperplasia** is an increase in the **number** of cells. It occurs in tissues capable of replication.
*   **Physiologic:** Breast development at puberty, liver regeneration.
*   **Pathologic:** Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH), Endometrial Hyperplasia.
*   **Note:** Hyperplasia is controlled; if the signal stops, it stops. This distinguishes it from neoplasia (cancer), though it can be a fertile soil for cancer development.

:::clinical
**Clinical Correlate: Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH)**

An elderly male presents with difficulty urinating (hesitancy, dribbling) and nocturia. This is due to hyperplasia of the prostate glandular and stromal cells, which compresses the urethra.

**Clinical Signs:**
- Urinary frequency and urgency
- Weak stream
- Nocturia
:::

### Atrophy
**Atrophy** is a decrease in cell size and number.
*   **Causes:** Disuse (cast), loss of innervation, diminished blood supply, inadequate nutrition, loss of endocrine stimulation (menopause).
*   **Mechanism:** Decreased protein synthesis and increased protein degradation (Ubiquitin-Proteasome pathway). Autophagy also plays a role.

### Metaplasia
**Metaplasia** is a reversible change where one adult cell type is replaced by another adult cell type better able to withstand the stress.
*   **Example:** In smokers, the fragile ciliated columnar epithelium of the trachea is replaced by tough stratified squamous epithelium.
*   **Cost:** Loss of function (ciliary clearance), which predisposes to infection.
*   **Barrett's Esophagus:** Squamous to columnar metaplasia in the distal esophagus due to acid reflux (GERD).

:::clinical
**Clinical Correlate: Barrett's Esophagus**

Chronic acid reflux causes the stratified squamous epithelium of the lower esophagus to change into intestinal-type columnar epithelium (with goblet cells). This is a precursor lesion to esophageal adenocarcinoma.

* **Slide 41, 48:** Irreversible injury (necrosis)

If adaptation fails, injury ensues.
*   **Reversible Injury:** The hallmark is **cellular swelling** (hydropic change) due to failure of the Na+/K+ pump (ATP depletion). Fatty change (steatosis) is another sign, seen in the liver.
*   **Irreversible Injury:** Characterized by **membrane damage** (plasma and lysosomal) and **mitochondrial dysfunction** (inability to generate ATP).

### Nuclear Changes in Necrosis
1.  **Pyknosis:** Nuclear shrinkage and increased basophilia.
2.  **Karyorrhexis:** Fragmentation of the pyknotic nucleus.
3.  **Karyolysis:** Fading of the nucleus (digestion by DNase).

* **Slide 50:** Coagulative Necrosis
* **Slide 53:** Liquefactive Necrosis
* **Slide 55:** Caseous Necrosis
:::

### Coagulative Necrosis
*   **Cause:** Ischemia (infarction).
*   **Features:** Architecture is preserved for days (ghost cells). Proteins denature.
*   **Location:** All solid organs (Heart, Kidney, Spleen) **EXCEPT the brain**.

### Liquefactive Necrosis
*   **Cause:** Bacterial/Fungal infections, or Ischemia in the **Brain**.
*   **Features:** Digestion of dead cells results in a liquid viscous mass (pus).

### Caseous Necrosis
*   **Cause:** Tuberculosis (TB).
*   **Features:** "Cheese-like" friable white appearance. Granuloma formation.

### Fat Necrosis
*   **Cause:** Acute Pancreatitis or trauma to breast.
*   **Features:** Chalky white deposits (saponification) due to fatty acids combining with calcium.

### Fibrinoid Necrosis
*   **Cause:** Immune complex deposition (Vasculitis, Malignant Hypertension).
*   **Features:** Bright pink amorphous appearance in vessel walls.

## Part 4: Apoptosis

:::slides 60-68
* **Slide 67:** Mitochondrial Pathway
* **Slide 68:** Death Receptor Pathway
:::

**Apoptosis** is programmed cell death. It is tightly regulated and does **NOT** elicit inflammation (unlike necrosis).
*   **Physiologic:** Embryogenesis (webbed fingers), hormone withdrawal (menstruation), elimination of self-reactive lymphocytes.
*   **Pathologic:** DNA damage (radiation), accumulation of misfolded proteins.

### Mechanisms
1.  **Intrinsic (Mitochondrial) Pathway:** Triggered by cell injury/stress. **Bcl-2** family sensors activate **Bax/Bak**, creating channels in the mitochondria. **Cytochrome c** leaks out and activates **Caspase 9**.
2.  **Extrinsic (Death Receptor) Pathway:** Triggered by receptor-ligand interactions (Fas/FasL, TNF). Activates **Caspase 8**.

Both pathways converge on **Executioner Caspases (3, 6, 7)** which chew up the cytoskeleton and DNA.`,
        questions: `**1. A 60-year-old man with a history of hypertension dies from a stroke. Autopsy reveals a heart weighing 550 grams (normal <350g) with a thickened left ventricular wall. Which of the following cellular adaptations best explains this finding?**

A. Hyperplasia
B. Hypertrophy
C. Atrophy
D. Metaplasia
E. Dysplasia

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to Reveal Answer</strong></summary>

**Answer: B (Hypertrophy)**

**Rationale**: The heart is composed of permanent cells (cardiac myocytes) that cannot divide. Therefore, in response to increased workload (hypertension), the cells must increase in **size** (hypertrophy) rather than number (hyperplasia).

**2. A 45-year-old woman presents with severe abdominal pain. Laboratory tests show elevated pancreatic enzymes (amylase and lipase). Which type of necrosis is most likely to be found in the peripancreatic fat?**

A. Coagulative necrosis
B. Liquefactive necrosis
C. Caseous necrosis
D. Fat necrosis
E. Fibrinoid necrosis

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to Reveal Answer</strong></summary>

**Answer: D (Fat necrosis)**

**Rationale**: Acute pancreatitis leads to the release of activated pancreatic enzymes that digest adipose tissue. The released fatty acids combine with calcium to form chalky white deposits (saponification), characteristic of **fat necrosis**.

**3. Which of the following is a feature of irreversible cell injury?**

A. Cellular swelling
B. Fatty change
C. Ribosomal detachment
D. Membrane defects
E. Loss of microvilli

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to Reveal Answer</strong></summary>

**Answer: D (Membrane defects)**

**Rationale**: **Membrane damage** (plasma membrane, mitochondrial membrane, lysosomal membrane) is a hallmark of **irreversible** injury. Cellular swelling, fatty change, ribosomal detachment, and loss of microvilli are typically reversible if the stress is removed.

**4. A 30-year-old man presents with a chronic cough and weight loss. A chest X-ray shows a cavitary lesion in the upper lobe of the right lung. Biopsy reveals a granuloma with a central area of amorphous, granular debris. What type of necrosis is this?**

A. Coagulative necrosis
B. Liquefactive necrosis
C. Caseous necrosis
D. Fat necrosis
E. Gangrenous necrosis

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to Reveal Answer</strong></summary>

**Answer: C (Caseous necrosis)**

**Rationale**: **Caseous necrosis** is characteristic of **tuberculosis**. It appears "cheese-like" (white and friable) and is often associated with granulomas.

**5. Which of the following molecules is a key initiator of the intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway of apoptosis?**

A. Fas ligand
B. TNF
C. Cytochrome c
D. Caspase 8
E. Perforin

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to Reveal Answer</strong></summary>

**Answer: C (Cytochrome c)**

**Rationale**: The **intrinsic pathway** is triggered by mitochondrial damage, leading to the leakage of **cytochrome c** into the cytoplasm. Cytochrome c binds to Apaf-1 and activates **Caspase 9**. Fas ligand and TNF are involved in the extrinsic pathway (Caspase 8).
