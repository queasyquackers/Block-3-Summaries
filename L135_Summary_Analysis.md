Analysis of case-control studies
EXAMPLE: Case control study of Parkinson’s Disease (PD)and coffee 
consumption
Odds ratio = [(a/b) / (c/d)] = [(42/247) / (107/825)] = 1.3
“A PD patient is 1.3 times as likely as a healthy individual to have been a coffee drinker”

•   Relative Risk = 1.0             No Risk
(meaning the rate of poor outcome among those with risk factor is the same as 
those without)
• Relative Risk > 1                  Elevated Risk
(meaning the rate of poor outcome is more common among those with the risk 
factor present)
• Relative Risk < 1                 Reduced Risk
(meaning the rate of poor outcome is less common among those with the risk 
factor present)

Number of persons who would have to receive an intervention for 1 to 
benefit.
NNT = 1/ (rate in untreated group -rate in treated group)=1/Absolute risk 
reduction)
To determine absolute risk reduction subtract incidence with treatment from 
incidence without treatment : 0.0043 − 0.0028 = 0.0015 = Absolute Risk 
Reduction
The number needed to treat is the inverse of the Absolute risk reduction: 
1/0.0015=667
This means that if 667 individuals are exposed to the risk factor, 1 case will 
be prevented (NNT).
Number Needed to Harm (NNH) is similar but is 1/attributable risk when you 
are looking at the harmful side effects of a drug.
