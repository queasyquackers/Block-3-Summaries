**Session:** Lecture #102

## Part 1: Lumbar Diagnosis and Biomechanics

:::slides 3-5
* **Slide 3:** Lumbar Spine Primary Lordotic Curve. Note that T10-T12 is also lordotic.
* **Slide 5:** Range of Motion (Flexion 0-80, Extension 0-30, Lateral bend 0-35, Rotation 0-45).
:::

### Visual Inspection & Landmarks
*   **Planes of Symmetry:** Inspect the patient for symmetry in the **Horizontal**, **Sagittal**, and **Coronal** planes.
*   **Plumb Line:** Compare left to right relative to the midline.
*   **Key Landmarks:**
    *   **T12:** Identified by the 12th rib.
    *   **L4:** Level of the **Iliac Crests**.
    *   **S2:** Level of the **PSIS** (Posterior Superior Iliac Spine).
    *   **Sacral Sulci:** Just above the flatter surface of the sacrum.
    *   **Transverse Processes (TP):** About 1.5 inches lateral to the spinous process.

### Fryette's Principles
**Fryette's 1st Principle (Type I Mechanics):**
*   **Neutral** spine.
*   **Group** curves (3+ segments).
*   Sidebending and Rotation are **Opposite** (e.g., N Sx Ry).
*   Maintained by **Long Restrictors** (Erector Spinae).
*   *Example:* L1-L4 N Sr Rl (Neutral, Sidebent Right, Rotated Left).

**Fryette's 2nd Principle (Type II Mechanics):**
*   **Non-Neutral** spine (Flexion or Extension).
*   **Single** segment.
*   Sidebending and Rotation are **Same** (e.g., F/E Rx Sx).
*   Maintained by **Short Restrictors** (Rotatores, Intertransversarii).
*   *Example:* L3 F Rr Sr (Flexed, Rotated Right, Sidebent Right).
*   **Clinical Note:** Type II dysfunctions are often found at the apex or extremes of Type I curves. Treat Type IIs before Type Is.

## Part 2: Diagnosis of Somatic Dysfunction (TART)

:::slides 13-20
* **Slide 13:** Rotational diagnosis (Posterior TP).
* **Slide 17:** Extension Test (Sphinx/TV Watching).
* **Slide 18:** Flexion Test (Child's Pose/Prayer).
:::

### TART Criteria
1.  **T**issue Texture Change: Check for **Hypertonicity** (contracted, tight) or **Hypotonicity** (pliable, supple).
2.  **A**symmetry: Visual or palpatory (e.g., uneven TPs).
3.  **R**estriction of Motion: Named for the **freedom of motion**.
4.  **T**enderness: Subjective complaint from the patient.

### Diagnosing Type II Dysfunction
1.  **Static Palpation:** Identify the **Posterior Transverse Process**. This indicates the side of **Rotation**.
    *   *Example:* Right TP is posterior = Rotated Right.
2.  **Motion Testing (Flexion vs. Extension):**
    *   **Extension Test (Sphinx):** If the asymmetry **improves** (TPs become more level), the diagnosis is **Extended** (ERS).
    *   **Flexion Test (Child's Pose):** If the asymmetry **improves**, the diagnosis is **Flexed** (FRS).
    *   *Mnemonic:* The diagnosis is named for the position where the dysfunction "disappears" (gets better).

## Part 3: Soft Tissue Techniques

:::slides 34-37
* **Slide 34:** Technique list.
:::

### Goals of Soft Tissue
*   Relax hypertonic muscles and fascia.
*   Improve circulation (Arterial supply, Venous/Lymph drainage).
*   **"We suffer from two things: the want of supply and a burden of dead deposits"** - A.T. Still.
*   Desensitize the **Stretch Reflex** (Muscle Spindle mechanism).

### Contraindications
*   **Absolute:** None (technically).
*   **Relative/Cautions:**
    *   Fractures, Open wounds.
    *   Infections, Abscesses.
    *   **DVT (Deep Vein Thrombosis):** Risk of embolism.
    *   Coagulopathy, Neoplasm.
    *   Recent surgical site.

### Techniques
1.  **Prone Traction (Two-handed, Lumbosacral):** Hands contact paravertebral muscles, applying a lateral/anterior stretch.
2.  **Prone Pressure with Counterleverage:** One hand on paraspinals, other on ASIS (pulling up) to create a twisting/stretching force.
3.  **Supine Extension:** Kneading/stretching the lumbar paraspinals with the patient supine.

## Part 4: Lumbosacral Spring Test

:::slides 29
* **Slide 29:** Spring Test mechanics.
:::

*   **Objective:** Evaluate the lumbosacral junction (L5/S1) and sacral base.
*   **Procedure:**
    *   Patient prone.
    *   Physician places heel of hand over the lumbosacral junction.
    *   Apply a short, quick anterior "springing" force.
*   **Interpretation:**
    *   **Negative Test:** Good spring/compliance. (Normal or Flexed dysfunction).
    *   **Positive Test:** Resistance/Stiffness (Hard end feel). Indicates an **Extended** dysfunction (backward bending restriction) or sacral dysfunction.`,
    questions: `**1. A patient has a Type II somatic dysfunction at L3. The right transverse process is posterior. When the patient is placed in the Sphinx position (extension), the asymmetry becomes MORE pronounced. What is the diagnosis?**

A. L3 E Rr Sr
B. L3 E Rl Sl
C. L3 F Rr Sr
D. L3 F Rl Sl
E. L3 N Rr Sl

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to Reveal Answer</strong></summary>

**Answer: C (L3 F Rr Sr)**

**Rationale**: 
1.  **Rotation:** Right TP posterior = **Rotated Right** (Rr).
2.  **Type II:** Rotation and Sidebending are to the **Same** side -> **Sidebent Right** (Sr).
3.  **Flexion/Extension:** The asymmetry got **worse** in Extension. This means it does *not* like extension. It must like Flexion. Therefore, it is a **Flexed** dysfunction (FRS).
    *   Diagnosis: **L3 F Rr Sr**.

**2. Which of the following is considered a "Long Restrictor" muscle responsible for maintaining Type I group curves?**

A. Rotatores
B. Intertransversarii
C. Multifidus
D. Erector Spinae
E. Levator Costae

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to Reveal Answer</strong></summary>

**Answer: D (Erector Spinae)**

**Rationale**: **Type I (Group)** dysfunctions are maintained by long, multisegmental muscles like the **Erector Spinae** (Iliocostalis, Longissimus, Spinalis). Type II (Single) dysfunctions are maintained by short restrictors like Rotatores and Intertransversarii.
</details>

**3. During a structural exam, you perform the Lumbosacral Spring Test. You encounter a hard, resistant end-feel with no spring. This finding is most consistent with which diagnosis?**

A. Normal Lumbosacral Junction
B. L5 Flexed Dysfunction
C. L5 Extended Dysfunction
D. Anterior Sacral Torsion
E. Unilateral Sacral Flexion

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to Reveal Answer</strong></summary>

**Answer: C (L5 Extended Dysfunction)**

**Rationale**: A **Positive Spring Test** (resistance/stiffness) indicates that the segment or sacrum resists anterior motion. This is characteristic of an **Extended** dysfunction (where the segment is stuck in extension/backward bending and resists flexion/anterior springing) or a posterior sacral base (sacral extension). A Flexed dysfunction would spring easily.

**4. You are assessing a patient's lumbar spine and find TART changes from L1-L4. The transverse processes are posterior on the left at all these levels. The asymmetry remains unchanged in both flexion and extension. What is the correct notation?**

A. L1-L4 N Sl Rr
B. L1-L4 N Sr Rl
C. L1-L4 F Sr Rl
D. L1-L4 E Sl Rr
E. L1-L4 N Rl Sr

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to Reveal Answer</strong></summary>

**Answer: B (L1-L4 N Sr Rl)**

**Rationale**:
1.  **Group/Neutral:** Multiple segments + no change in F/E = **Type I (Neutral)**.
2.  **Rotation:** Posterior TP on Left = **Rotated Left** (Rl).
3.  **Sidebending:** In Type I, S and R are **Opposite**. So **Sidebent Right** (Sr).
    *   Notation: **N Sr Rl** (or N Rl Sr). Option B matches standard notation.

**5. Which of the following soft tissue techniques involves the physician placing one hand on the lumbar paraspinals and the other on the ASIS to create a counter-leverage force?**

A. Prone Traction
B. Prone Pressure with Counterleverage
C. Supine Extension
D. Lateral Recumbent Kneading
E. Inhibition

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to Reveal Answer</strong></summary>

**Answer: B (Prone Pressure with Counterleverage)**

**Rationale**: **Prone Pressure with Counterleverage** involves pushing the paraspinal muscles medially/anteriorly while pulling up on the **ASIS** (Anterior Superior Iliac Spine) to create a twisting/stretching force through the lumbar region.
