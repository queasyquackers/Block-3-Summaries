Hello, class. Dr. Jonathan Geisler here. So today I'm going to be talking to you about the orbit and the extraocular muscles. And this lecture is going to be distributed among four videos. So this is the first one. So let's go ahead and get started. Okay. So there's going to be quite a few session or objectives for these sessions. But let's go ahead and start with the one that we're going to be covering in this first of four videos. And so by the end of the session, you should be able to infer what structures can be affected by blowout fractures of the orbit. In terms of sort of contents for this first video, this part one, we're going to be talking about orbit boundaries and its contents. So here we're looking at an axial MRI of the head. You can see the nose here. Here's the brain right there in the cranial cavity. These are the ethmoidal sinuses, bright white here. These are the eyes. And then this here is the orbit. You might be able to tell that this is a T2-weighted MRI by the fact that the cerebral spinal fluid is bright white. What I want to draw your attention to here is how bright it is in the orbit. And that's basically telling us that the orbit has a lot of adipose tissue. This is one of those interesting anatomical facts that's not really often apparent when you look at a kind of schematic image in an anatomy textbook, but it's important because this adipose tissue essentially behaves sort of like a fluid. So if there is pressure on the orbit, fluids are non -compressible. So this fat is non-compressible, and if there's enough pressure, that adipose tissue is going to want to go somewhere else, and that can potentially cause a trauma in the orbit and surrounding tissues. So let's talk about the boundaries of the orbit and one way to sort of envision it is like a pyramid with an apex here in the posterior end of the orbit and then four sides, a superior side also called the roof, a medial side, an inferior side or floor, and a lateral side. in terms of the bones that make up these different sides, the roof is predominantly formed by the frontal bone. Then the lateral side here is formed by this pink bone, the sphenoid bone. It's divided into two parts. So the greater wing of the sphenoid makes up most of the lateral side of the orbit. This part here called the lesser wing of the sphenoid contributes a little part here to the roof of the orbit. And this bone here, the zygomatic bone, helps form that lateral side of the orbit. The maxilla in gray forms most of the floor of the orbit. And then the medial side of the orbit has contributions from the frontal, but is predominantly formed here by this plate of the ethmoid, and also a contribution here from this bone here, which is the lacrimal. Now, in addition to these bones, which are fairly rigid, the floor of the orbit, right, or this orbital pyramid here, is sealed up by this tough fibrous membrane called the orbital septum. And the reason that's important is pretty much all sides of the orbit are fairly rigid. So, for example, if there was bleeding inside the orbit, such like maybe a patient arrives in the ER after being in an automobile accident, you can have a situation develop in the orbit, much like a compartment syndrome in the limb. So a lot of pressure can build up very quickly. So you might choose to cut this medial or lateral palpebral ligament to let some of the blood out and relieve the pressure in the orbit. here we're looking at a coronal ct of the head this is where the anterior cranial cavity and the brain is right here got one orbit the other here's the oral cavity with the teeth as you know by now black essentially indicates air so these are the paranasal sinuses that are on either side of the nasal cavities here. And what I want to draw your attention to is how incredibly thin is the bone that is separating the medial wall of the orbit from the ethmoidal sinuses and the floor of the orbit from the maxillary sinuses. And so as I was talking before, if there's any pressure to the orbit, say maybe this individual falls and there's a lot of pressure on the eye. That adipose tissue, remember, is not going to be very compressible, so it's going to want to go somewhere. It might break through this thin bone here, and in fact, you can see right here some of the contents of the orbit are pushing into this ethmoidal sinus here. Also, they may go into the maxillary sinus, and so it's not just adipose tissue that would do this, but potentially some of the extraocular muscles, which we'll be talking about in a minute, could get trapped in there. You could have also some of the nerves and artery of the eye get damaged or cut by these fractures. So whenever you have contents of the orbit going into one of these adjacent paranasal sinuses, that's called a blowout fracture. So for the rest of this video, I'm going to focus on the basic anatomy, these extraocular muscles. So we're going to start with this one here called the levator palpebrae superioris. The name kind of tells you what it does levator elevates the superior eyelid in terms of its origin it's from the lesser wing of the sphenoid and it starts on that superior tarsus the upper eyelid and it also contains some smooth muscle fibers this view here shows if you had removed the brain or approaching the orbit superiorly break through and remove that roof of the orbit you can see this first muscle here is the levator palpebrae superioris. Next, we have four ****** muscles. There's a superior, inferior, and medial and lateral ******. All of these muscles attach from this structure here in the posterior side of the orbit, which is called the common tendinus ring. That common tendinus ring is also attached to the lesser wing of the sphenoid. These muscles essentially go anteriorly, and they're going to attach to the sclera just posterior to the cornea. Then we have two oblique muscles. So first we have the superior oblique. That too is going to originate from the lesser wing of the sphenoid. It's going to go anteriorly, pass through this little muscular sling called the trochlea, which redirects the muscle fibers posterior laterally and then it attaches on the sclera on the superior side of the eye. The inferior oblique has its origin here on the medial side of the orbit passes laterally and a little posteriorly to attach to the inferior side of the eye a little deep here to the lateral ******. Now in terms of the innervations of the muscles one way to remember is by this kind of sort of fake chemical formula here, SO4LR6A03. So SO stands for superior oblique. The 4 indicates it's innervated by the fourth cranial nerve. LR stands for lateral ******. The 6 indicates it's innervated by the sixth cranial nerve. AO stands for all others. And 3 is the third cranial nerve. these cranial nerves also have other names so the fourth is also called the trochlear nerve and one other way to sort of remember this is that you remember the superior oblique passed through that trochlea that little muscular that little sling and so another name for the fourth cranial nerve is the trochlear nerve then the lateral ****** attaches to the lateral side of the eye. When it contracts, it's going to abduct the eye. And so another name for the sixth cranial nerve is the abducens nerve. And finally, just going back to the superior tarsal muscle that's kind of embedded or part of that levator palpebrae superioris, it's innervated by post -ganglionic sympathetics whose cell bodies reside in the superior cervical ganglion. Okay, so that's the end of this first of four videos. Next, we'll be talking about simple movements of the eye, and I look forward to seeing you then. Okay, so this objective we covered in the first four videos. In this video, by the end of it, you should be able to differentiate actions and functions of the extraocular muscles. and in terms of content we're really going to focus on the simple movements of the eye in this video okay so let's talk a little bit about terminology and actions of the eyeball so here we have a patient looking straight at us um kind of facing us so this would be called primary position if the eye looks upward that would be called elevation eye looking downward that's depression. Eye looking over towards the nose or the medial side, that's adduction. Eye looking over towards the lateral side, that would be called abduction. If the eye is rotating this way, that's called extortion. And the eye rotating this way, that would be called intorsion. Now, in terms of this differentiating action and function of the extraocular muscles, action is what a muscle would do in isolation whereas a muscle's function is how it actually contributes to a particular motion now sometimes these are the same an example of one of the muscles from the first video was the levator palpebrae superioris its only antagonist is gravity so if that muscle contracts its action and function are the same the superior eyelid elevates here we have sort of a schematic image of the head in superior view sort of like what we might see in an axial ct or mri and all of here are the two orbits and as you remember their boundaries are primarily made up of bone this blue line indicates the axis of the orbit it's not going straight anterior posteriorly it's at sort of an angle and it's fixed it doesn't change by contrast the axis of the eyeball varies. Here it's in primary position looking forward, but of course the eye can look many different directions. And the fact that these two are often offset causes a lot of complexity in understanding the functions of the extraocular muscles. In this video, we're going to start with the simple cases. So here we have an eye in primary position, looking straight forward, if we contract the lateral ******, the eye is going to abduct. Now the optical axis and the orbital axis are aligned. If we contract the superior ******, the eye elevates. If we then contract the inferior ******, the abducted eye depresses. now again starting in primary position if we contract the medial ****** the eye is going to adduct now notice here the superior oblique here passing through that trochlea because it goes through that and the fibers then go posterior laterally essentially this muscle is pulling from the front of the eye this is different than what we saw with the ****** muscles that all attached to that common tendinous ring. So if the superior oblique contracts, then the adducted eye is going to depress. Then if we can kind of see through the eye here to see the inferior oblique attaching on its inferior side, if the inferior oblique contracts, then the eye elevates. So just to summarize these simple cases, the superior ****** is a strong elevator of the already A -B ducted eyeball. By contrast, the inferior ****** is a strong depressor of the already A-B ducted eyeball. The inferior oblique is a strong elevator of the already A -deducted eye, and the superior oblique is a strong depressor of the already A-deducted eye. so that's the end of this second video we'll next deal with complex movements of the eye i look forward to seeing you then okay so these first two objectives we covered in the first and second videos here here in the third by the end of this session you should be able to describe how extra ocular muscles work in pairs to induce or avoid torsion you should also be able to describe how the extra ocular muscles work in pairs to move the eye in primary position and we can kind of summarize this video really focused on the complex movements of the eye so I'm going to spend some time going over this particular image here you'll find something like this in your textbook and it's pretty much in most anatomical textbooks when they talk about the extraocular muscles in some ways this image is very confusing but because it sort of can be confused with another image that really gets to how can you identify where a particular lesion is on a nerve that innervates a muscle of the eye we need to spend some time going over it first thing to focus on is this image is looking at actions not function right so this is if one single extraocular muscle is going to contract that is not typically the case with a lot of movements of the eye. So this is sort of a unique situation here when we're looking at this particular image. The other key thing, and this is probably the most important, is this only applies to the eye in primary position. That means the patient's looking straight ahead. The minute the eye deviates from primary position, it's going to get more complicated, a little bit different than what this particular image portrays. So just to go through here, these letters here, I-O-L -R-S-O, These all refer to our different muscles, superior ******, medial ******, inferior ******. And then what you'll notice here, these kind of larger arrows and smaller arrows. So if we start with things that sort of make sense here, like medial ******, it's a fairly straightforward movement. It contracts, and the eye is going to be adducted. Similar with lateral ******, that muscle contracts. The eye is going to be abducted. But then we see things a little more confusing here with like superior ****** here. We see this angled elevation, but also this other little line here. What's actually happening here is that the eye is essentially a sphere. So whenever you pull on a ball, it basically moves much like a wheel with an axis of rotation. So the actual movement is a curved line or an arc. And what they've done here is split that curved arc movement into a series of orthogonal vectors. I find that somewhat confusing, and so I'm going to spend some time showing some other images that I think are really going to make a lot more sense to you. So where these complex movements come from this fact that the axis of the orbit, which is fixed, is often at an angle from the axis of the eyeball. And whenever that happens, if one muscle is going to contract, in all likelihood, there's going to be some torsion that's going to also accompany either the elevation or the depression. Now, there are cases where we want to have torsion. If we're tilting our head to one side or the other, we want a little bit of intorsion or extorsion to maintain a level gaze. But more often than not, torsion is something to avoid. And so to avoid the torsion when the axis of the eyeball and the axis of the orbit are not in line, basically multiple muscles have to contract at once. So let me walk through this image here. It's a schematic image of kind of the superior view of the head. You can see the nose here. And this red arrow on this side is basically referring to the vector of movement for the inferior and superior ******, right? So they're going to pull either on the superior or inferior side of the sclera like this, back towards the posterior or the apex of the orbit. So the axis of rotation is just 90 degrees to the direction of the muscle pulling, right? So essentially, if we project this axis of rotation out, it would appear right here on the medial corner of the eye. So this is for inferior and superior ******. Then if we go on the other eye, this vector here is really showing kind of the way that both the inferior and superior oblique pull. And so, again, the axis of rotation is 90 degrees to that. If we project that out, that comes out in the lateral corner of the eye. Now, of course, there's inferior and superior ****** on both orbits as well as inferior and superior oblique. So this image here would just show the axis of rotation of all these muscles on both eyes. Again, so here we have axis of rotation of superior and inferior ******, and here we would have superior and inferior oblique. Now, if we have the patient looking straight at us in primary position, here is the axis of rotation of the superior ****** and inferior ******. and here in that lateral corner is the axis of rotation of the superior oblique and inferior oblique. So let's say this patient is going to elevate their eye starting in primary position. So if they were just to contract the superior ******, you would get this arc of movement, which is essentially going around this axis of rotation for the superior and inferior ******. If they also at the same time, right, or let's just say they just contract the inferior oblique, it too will go around its axis of rotation right here. But if they contract both of these muscles at the same time, the torsion effects are going to cancel out. You're going to get smooth elevation. In this case, the superior ****** is doing intorsion, inferior obliques doing extorsion, and those cancel out smooth elevation. So we just talked a little bit about primary position. And so one way to think about that is in primary position, roughly you got kind of 50-50 in terms of the contraction of the superior ****** and inferior oblique. and this would be elevation without any sort of torsion. So this little schematic image, you have more contraction, less contraction. Here's the abeducted eye. Here's primary position. Here's the adeducted eye. If you remember from the last video, if you have the abeducted eye, pretty much the only thing you need to do to elevate the eye without any sort of torsion is contract superior ******. So all superior ******, no inferior oblique. By contrast with the adeducted eye, if you remember, You just need to contract the inferior oblique, nothing else, and you'll get elevation without torsion. So you can imagine at this point right here, you might need about, you know, 75% superior ******, 25 % inferior obliques. And we would see the same thing on the other eye. What about depression? So if the patient wants to press their eye, they're going to do inferior ******, right? it would rotate around this axis superior oblique would rotate around this axis this would be intorsion this would be extorsion but essentially their torsion effects are going to cancel out and you're going to get smooth depression now let's say if we wanted torsion without any elevation or depression so both the superior ****** and the superior oblique attached to the superior side of the eye. So you can see if these muscle bellies shorten, the eye is just going to rotate like this. Of course, it's not going to go all the way around, be more subtle, but this would be the direction of rotation. This is intorsion. Remember the superior ******, that causes elevation, intorsion. Superior oblique causes depression and intorsion. So in this case, if you contract both of these muscles the elevation and the depression will cancel out and you'll get smooth intorsion. Then looking at depression and extortion and and how this relates to the canceling out with elevation here if we contract both the inferior ****** and the inferior oblique and these muscle bellies are going to shorten. The eye would rotate in this direction. That's extorsion. The elevation of the inferior oblique is going to cancel out with the depression of the inferior ******, and you're going to get smooth extorsion. Okay, so this is the end of this particular video. Next, we're really going to kind of go to the next step which is sort of applying this information to understanding what's affecting a particular patient so that'll be nerve lesions and extraocular muscles i look forward to seeing you then okay so in terms of session objectives we've covered in these four in the previous three videos now in this video which is kind of more clinically relevant one we're going to at the end of it you should be able to predict lesions and nerves of the orbit based on test of extraocular muscles. We're going to focus on really nerve lesions here, but in reality, at least with the information I'm going to be providing to you, it would be difficult to tell whether the problem is with a particular nerve or the muscle it innervates. Okay, so the key thing with this particular image here, and it might look familiar to you, right? We have a series of extraocular muscles, right? Inferior oblique, medial ******, and we have the eye here. You might say, oh, this looks familiar to me. I've seen this before because it looks a lot like a chart that I showed at the beginning of the previous video. And students often confuse the two, but this is very, very different. So let me just go back to review. That previous image was looking at or trying to describe the actions of the extraocular muscles with the eye in primary position. It's somewhat theoretical. It's basically saying if your patient's looking ahead, you could somehow tell them just, you know, contract the superior ******, what would the eye do when it starts in primary position? This image is something very different. So this is much more clinically relevant. And basically what it's saying is this is how you want the patient to move their eye try to figure out where a particular problem is or at least to test the function of all their extraocular muscles and so that previous schematic diagram was all about primary position this one is not basically what you want to do is get the patient out of primary position because you remember primary position is complicated. You need two muscles to create intorsion, two muscles to create extorsion, two to elevate, two to depress the eye. And so if you see a problem there, it's hard to know which of the muscles or which of the nerves that are innervating those muscles is not working properly. So what you want to do with your patient is get them to move the eye out of primary position, and then you have a reasonable shot of figuring out what the problem is. So you're going to ask the patient to kind of create this H pattern by either following your finger or maybe a flashlight and then seeing if the patient can do all these movements. So let's say we start with primary position, but now we want to get the eye out of primary position. We ask the patient to adduct the eye. They can do that. That tells us medial ****** is working well. Then you want to depress the adducted eye. Check superior oblique's working well. Elevate the adducted eye. Inferior oblique is working well. And go back to kind of a level gaze, abeduct the eye, lateral ****** is working, check. Depress the abeducted eye, inferior ****** is working, check. Elevate the abeducted eye, superior ****** is working, check. So essentially what we're doing here is we're moving the eye to these extreme corners where we're sort of forcing function to equal action and in a place where really only one single muscle is causing the observed movement. So let's apply this kind of thinking to a couple patients. So here, let's say we have this patient present here. First thing you notice is this eye is closed, right? We call this ptosis. And so this is our first hint of what's going on here. If you remember, there are some smooth muscle fibers in the levator palpebrae superioris. superior auras that are being innervated by a sympathetic to a cell body or in that superior cervical ganglion. So this is a first hint that the ocular motor nerve is not working properly because those nerve fibers travel in the ocular motor nerve. Now, if we force open that eyelid, ask the patient to look straight ahead, we see this eye is working fine. This one definitely not, and we kind of refer to this condition as down and out. So I haven't talked much about antagonists at this point, but that's really what's going on here. So if the ocular motor nerve in its entirety is knocked out, right, superior ****** not working, inferior oblique not working, medial ****** not working, inferior ****** not working. So the only things left, right, are going to be the lateral ******, which is innervated by the abducens nerve, and the superior oblique, which is innervated by the trochlear nerve. Lateral ****** is going to be able to abduct the eye because there's no antagonist. The medial ****** is not working, so that's the out part. And then the superior oblique is going to depress the eye because the superior ****** and inferior oblique are not working, so that's the down part. Now, one other thing to remember about the ocular motor nerve, this is sort of the condition where the entire nerve has a lesion on, it's not working. But do remember that the acromotor nerve splits into a superior and an inferior division. Do superior division innervates the levator palpebrae superioris and the superior ******, whereas the inferior division is going to innervate the inferior oblique medial ****** and inferior ******. So you could also have some slight differences in how a patient presents, depending on whether that lesion's on the superior division or the inferior division of the oculomotor nerve. So now we're looking at probably the hardest case to kind of wrap your mind around. So here, you know, we have a patient, they're tilting their head to one side to maintain that level gaze. We want the eye to undergo smooth torsion without elevation or depression. And the eyes would do different kind of opposite types of torsion, right? So here we have the left eye, it's undergoing intorsion, and then the other eye is undergoing extorsion. Everything looks fine, right? Gaze straight ahead. But now when we have the patient tilt their head to the other side, right, we've flipped the required torsion for each eye. So now this eye is undergoing extorsion and this one's undergoing intorsion. This eye still looks fine, looking straight at us. But here I think you can see that this eye sort of deviated a little bit to go up. So what's happening here? To create intorsion, to smooth intorsion, what you want is both muscles that attach to the superior side of the eye, that's the superior oblique and the superior ****** to contract at the same time. They both cause intorsion. Remember, the superior ****** is going to cause elevation of the eye if it acts alone, and the superior oblique will cause depression of the eye if it acts alone. So that elevation of depression should cancel out and we get smooth intorsion. When we see the eye elevating here, that's telling us that the antagonist of the superior ****** is not working. So now what we're seeing is only the action of the superior ******, which is the cause and torsion of the eye, but also elevation. And so that tells us really that that antagonist is superior oblique or the nerve that innervates that the trochlear nerve is not working properly. And so this is sort of called the Bischowski sign. And basically whenever the head is tilted to the affected side, you're going to see this slight elevation of the eye. We could further test this, right, by having the patient look straight ahead, not tilt their head, do that H pattern, and we would predict that they could not depress the adducted eye. Okay, so this is our summary slide from all four videos. Let's just kind of review what you should be able to do at this point after watching these videos. So remember contents of the orbiter, not compressible. There's a lot of either either there's a fluid in the eye itself or the adipose tissue essentially acts as a fluid. It's not compressible. So if there's a lot of pressure in the eye that's going to require defects in the base or the walls of the orbit and you could very possibly get a blowout fracture. Remember action and function often mean very different things for extraocular muscles. The torsion in the eye occurs when the optic axis is at an angle to the axis of the orbit. And that happens quite a bit because remember the most common is primary position looking straight ahead. Now torsion is not always a bad thing. You want to have that intorsion or extorsion when you're tilting your head. Action and function are usually described relative to primary position so if you're looking in a textbook trying to see what's the the action or the function of a particular extraocular muscle that's in primary position but remember stating the obvious you can look many different ways and in those different orientations particular extra ocular muscle is going to have a different function and then finally extraocular muscle function is tested by having the patient not look in primary position so you want to get it out of complex areas and move it to those simple more extreme corners of the eye okay so that's the end of this video if you have any questions about the orbiter extraocular muscles please make sure to reach out to me see you again
