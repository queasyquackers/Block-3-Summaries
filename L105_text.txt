Most behaviours of the head and neck require 
cranial nerves to work together and with proper 
timing
Let’s briefly compare two examples:
1. Gag reflex
2. Deglutition (swallowing)
19
--- Page 70 ---
Unexpected object touches the 
pharynx
Efferent limb (CN X) sends 
motor signal to pharyngeal 
constrictors causing reverse 
peristalsis
Jaw opens (CN V3) 
and tongue lowers 
(CN XII) expelling food
Afferent limb (CN IX) sends 
response to CNS 
(nuclei in medulla)
Gag Reflex
variable
Gag reflex contributions vary between individuals but stay consistent within individuals
37% of people lack an appreciable gag reflex
20
--- Page 71 ---
Swallowing (Deglutition)
3 stages to swallowing
Misfiring nerves produce 
dysphagia (trouble swallowing)
