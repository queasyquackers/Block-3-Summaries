# Pathology: Inflammation

## Overview
*   **Definition:** A protective response to cell injury (infection, necrosis, trauma, etc.) intended to eliminate the cause and repair tissue.
*   **Cardinal Signs (Acute):**
    1.  **Rubor (Redness):** Vasodilation (Histamine, NO, Prostaglandins).
    2.  **Calor (Heat):** Increased blood flow (Vasodilation).
    3.  **Tumor (Swelling):** Edema/Permeability (Histamine, Leukotrienes).
    4.  **Dolor (Pain):** Prostaglandins (PGE<sub>2</sub>), Bradykinin.
    5.  **Functio Laesa:** Loss of function.

## Acute Inflammation
*   **Vascular Changes:**
    *   **Vasodilation:** Increased blood flow (Histamine, NO).
    *   **Increased Permeability:** Leakage of fluid and proteins (Exudate).
        *   **Transudate:** Low protein, low cellularity (Hydrostatic/Oncotic imbalance).
        *   **Exudate:** High protein, high cellularity (Inflammation/Permeability).
    *   **Stasis:** Slowed blood flow, allowing leukocytes to marginate.
*   **Cellular Events (Leukocyte Recruitment):**
    1.  **Margination:** Leukocytes move to the vessel wall.
    2.  **Rolling:** Weak adhesion via **Selectins** (L-selectin on WBC, E/P-selectin on Endothelium). Mediated by TNF/IL-1.
    3.  **Adhesion:** Firm attachment via **Integrins** (on WBC) binding to ICAM/VCAM (on Endothelium).
    :::correlate
    **Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency (LAD)**
    *   **Defect:** Autosomal Recessive defect in **Integrins** (CD18 subunit).
    *   **Clinical:** Delayed separation of umbilical cord, increased circulating neutrophils (leukocytosis), but **NO pus** formation at infection sites (neutrophils can't exit vessels).
    :::
    4.  **Transmigration (Diapedesis):** Crossing the endothelium (PECAM-1/CD31).
    5.  **Chemotaxis:** Migration toward injury along a chemical gradient (C5a, LTB<sub>4</sub>, IL-8, Bacterial products).
*   **Phagocytosis:**
    1.  **Recognition:** Opsonization (C3b, IgG) coats microbes for recognition.
    2.  **Engulfment:** Formation of phagosome.
    :::correlate
    **Chediak-Higashi Syndrome**
    *   **Defect:** Microtubule polymerization defect (LYST gene).
    *   **Pathology:** Impaired **phagolysosome fusion**.
    *   **Clinical:** Recurrent pyogenic infections, partial albinism, peripheral neuropathy.
    *   **Smear:** Giant granules in neutrophils.
    :::
    3.  **Killing:**
        *   **Oxygen-Dependent:** NADPH Oxidase &rarr; Superoxide &rarr; H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> &rarr; **HOCl (Bleach)** via **Myeloperoxidase (MPO)**.
        :::correlate
        **Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD)**
        *   **Defect:** **NADPH Oxidase** deficiency (X-linked or AR).
        *   **Pathology:** Inability to generate respiratory burst (superoxide).
        *   **Clinical:** Recurrent infections with **Catalase (+)** organisms (e.g., *S. aureus*, *Pseudomonas*, *Aspergillus*).
        :::
        *   **Oxygen-Independent:** Lysozyme, Major Basic Protein (Eosinophils).

## Timing of Inflammation
*   **Neutrophils:** Most predominant around **24 hours**. First responders in acute inflammation and acute bacterial infections.
*   **Macrophages:** Most predominant around **48-72 hours**.
*   **Granulation Tissue:** Present by **5-7 days** (new blood vessels/angiogenesis, macrophages, fibroblasts producing collagen).
*   **Fibrous Scar:** After **1-2 months** (especially in permanent tissue and large skin wounds).

## Types of Acute Inflammation
*   **Serous:** Mild, protein-poor fluid (e.g., blister from burn).
*   **Fibrinous:** Protein-rich exudate with fibrin (e.g., pericarditis, pleuritis).
*   **Suppurative (Purulent):** Pus formation (neutrophils + necrotic debris). Examples: Abscess, Empyema.

## Chemical Mediators
*   **Histamine:** Mast cells. Vasodilation, Permeability.
*   **Prostaglandins:** Vasodilation, Pain (PGE<sub>2</sub>), Fever.
*   **Leukotrienes:** Vasoconstriction, Bronchospasm, Permeability (LTC<sub>4</sub>, LTD<sub>4</sub>, LTE<sub>4</sub>), Chemotaxis (LTB<sub>4</sub>).
*   **Cytokines (TNF, IL-1):** Systemic effects (Fever, Acute Phase Reactants), Endothelial activation.
*   **Complement System:**
    *   **C3a, C5a:** Anaphylatoxins (Histamine release).
    *   **C5a:** Chemotaxis.
    *   **C3b:** Opsonization.
    *   **MAC (C5b-9):** Cell lysis.
*   **Bradykinin:** Pain, Vasodilation, Permeability.

## Chronic Inflammation
*   **Duration:** Prolonged (weeks/months).
*   **Cells:** **Macrophages**, Lymphocytes, Plasma Cells, **Eosinophils** (allergies, asthma, parasites).
*   **Key Point:** Think **neutrophils** for acute, **mononuclear cells** (lymphocytes, macrophages) for chronic.
*   **Granulomatous Inflammation:**
    *   **Mechanism:** Macrophages present antigen to helper T cells &rarr; IL-2 &rarr; TH1 cells secrete **IFN-gamma** &rarr; Activates Macrophages &rarr; Epithelioid Histiocytes & Giant Cells.
    *   **Purpose:** Attempt to contain offending agent difficult to eradicate (e.g., Mycobacterium tuberculosis).
    *   **Caseating (Necrotizing):** TB, Fungal infections.
    *   **Non-Caseating:** Sarcoidosis, Foreign body.

## Clinical Notes
*   **CD Markers:** Low numbers (<10) = T lymphocytes (CD4, CD8). CD10, CD19, CD20 = B lymphocytes.
*   **Normal Peripheral Blood Differential:**
    *   65-75% Neutrophils
    *   30-40% Lymphocytes (mostly T cells)
    *   1-2% Monocytes, Eosinophils, Basophils
*   **Note:** Most lymphocytes in blood are T cells, but you cannot distinguish T vs B by microscopy alone (need CD markers/flow cytometry).
