Health Disparities within Populations 
in Rural Counties
Center for Disease and Control and Prevention 
2017 Study found people of color and American 
Indian and Alaskan Native had worse health 
than Non- Hispanic White counter parts 
Rural black residents have a higher premature 
mortality rates than their white or urban black 
counterparts

Patterns of racial/ethnic inequities in health and why need to learn more
• Rates of disease and death elevated for historically marginalized racial 
group, blacks, Native American, Native Hawaiians  other Pacific Islanders
• Persistent of racial difference in health even after adjustment for socio 
economic status
• Research indicates that across virtually every type of diagnostic and 
treatment intervention blacks and other minorities receive fewer procedures 
and poorer-quality medical care than do whites

Are We Making Progress Toward 
Eliminating Healthcare 
Disparities?
The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality’s (AHRQ) 
2021 National Healthcare Disparities and Quality Report 
finds that since 2000, disparities have narrowed for only 
about
• 8% of measures of American Indian and Alaska Native 
populations, 
• 2% of measures for Asian populations
• 3% of measures for Black populations
• 4% of measures for Hispanic populations
• 10% of measures of Native Hawaiian/PacificIslander 
populations

What Factors are Associated with 
Healthcare Inequity?
• Separate and inequitable healthcare systems – due to residential 
segregation, the maldistribution of healthcare resources, health 
system policies (e.g., limited provider networks)
• “Tiered” health insurance and differences in provider 
reimbursement
• Clinician biases, stereotypes, and prejudice
• Race-based clinical decision support and algorithms
• A persistent lack of diversity among healthcare professionals

“Medical Apartheid” – Separate and 
Inequitable Care for Patients of Color
(Gangopadhyaya, 2021)
• Study investigated differences in Black and White patient safety 
measures using hospital discharge records from 27 states
• Black patients experienced higher rates of adverse patient safety 
events on 55% of patient safety measures
• For 82% of patient safety indicators, Black patients were significantly 
less likely to be admitted into hospitals classified as “high quality” 
(i.e., hospitals best at minimizing patient safety risks based on the median 
value of each patient safety indicator)
• This same research team found Black patients experience higher 
rates of hospital- acquired illnesses or injuries related to surgical 
procedures relative to white patients treated in the same hospital.
• Within-hospital differences in Black-white adverse patient safety rates 
remain when comparing Black and white patients with similar 
coverage types.

Racial Bias Among Healthcare 
Providers
• A systematic review of 15 studies measuring implicit bias and health outcomes 
confirmed that healthcare professionals hold the same level of implicit bias 
against Black, Latinx, and dark-skinned people as the general population, and 
that “implicit bias was significantly related to patient–provider interactions, 
treatment decisions, treatment adherence, and patient health outcomes” (Hall et 
al., 2015)
• A systematic review of 37 studies confirmed the substantial evidence of “pro- 
White or light-skin/anti-Black, Hispanic, American Indian or dark-skin bias” among 
a variety of healthcare professionals across multiple levels of training and 
disciplines (Maina et al. 2017)

Negative Patient Descriptors: Documenting Racial Bias in the 
Electronic Health Record
(Sun et al., 2022)
• Researchers analyzed a sample of 40,113 history and physical notes (January 
2019– October 2020) from 18,459 patients for sentences containing a negative 
descriptor (for example, resistant or noncompliant) of the patient or the patient’s 
behavior.
• Sought to determine the odds of finding at least one negative descriptor as a 
function of the patient’s race or ethnicity, controlling for sociodemographic and 
health characteristics [e.g., “refused,” “(not) adherent,” “(not) compliant,” “agitated”].
• Compared with White patients, Black patients had 2.54 times the odds of having at 
least one negative descriptor in the history and physical notes.
• “Our findings raise concerns about stigmatizing language in the EHR and its 
potential to exacerbate racial and ethnic health care disparities.”

Demonstration of Cultural 
Competency 
According to the NIH 
• “Cultural competency positively impacts 
care through service delivery that is 
“respectful of and responsive to the 
health beliefs, practices and cultural and 
linguistic needs of diverse patients”

process focusing on self reflection and 
personal critique

1. Cultural Destructiveness .  See the difference, stomp it out.  
Attitudes, policies, and practices that are destructive to cultures 
and consequently to the individuals within the culture
2.  Cultural Incapacity.  See the difference, make it wrong.  
System or individuals in a culture are extremely biased, believe 
in the superiority of the dominant group and assume a paternal 
posture toward the so called “ lesser” groups. These systems or 
individuals are often characterized unrealistic fear of people who 
are different than the dominant group.
3. Cultural Blindness.  See the difference, act as if you don’t.  
Belief that culture make no difference and that all people are the 
same values and behaviors of the dominant culture are 
presumed to be universally applicable and beneficial.

4. Cultural Pre-competence.  See the differences, respond  inadequately.  
An awareness of limitation in cross cultural communication and outreach. 
Individuals or organizations desire to provide fair and equitable treatment with 
appropriate cultural sensitivity without knowing what is possible or how to 
proceed
5.Competence.  See the difference, understand the difference. There is 
acceptance and respect for difference, continuous expansion of cultural 
knowledge and resources and variety of adaptations to belief systems, polices, 
and practices that make it possible to be effective in many cultural contexts.
6. Cultural Proficiency.  See the difference and respond. Holding culture in 
high esteem. Seeking to add to the knowledge base of cultural competent 
practice by conducting research, developing new approaches based on culture 
and formally and informally increasing the knowledge of others about culture 
and the dynamic of difference. Advocating for and championing cultural 
competent practices in all arenas.
