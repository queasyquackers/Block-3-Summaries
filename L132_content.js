# Pathology: Neoplasia (Part 2)

## Part 1: Genetic and Molecular Basis of Cancer
*   **Hallmarks of Malignancy (8 Key Features):**
    1.  **Proliferate without external stimuli (self-sufficiency in growth signals):** Oncogenes (e.g., *RAS*, *MYC*, *EGFR*) drive proliferation.
    2.  **Insensitive to growth-inhibitory signals:** Loss of Tumor Suppressor Genes (e.g., *RB*, *TP53*, *APC*).
    3.  **Metabolic switch to aerobic glycolysis (Warburg Effect):** Enables synthesis of macromolecules needed for fast cell growth (see below).
    4.  **Evade apoptosis:** Overexpression of anti-apoptotic proteins (e.g., *BCL2*) or loss of pro-apoptotic factors (*BAX*, *BAK*, *TP53*). Tumors are resistant to programmed cell death.
    5.  **Limitless proliferative capacity = Immortality:** Reactivation of **Telomerase** enzyme (present in 90% of cancers). Most somatic cells do not express telomerase.
    6.  **Sustained angiogenesis:** Secretion of VEGF to create new blood vessels for nutrient supply.
    7.  **Ability to invade and metastasize:** **THE DEFINITIVE CRITERION FOR MALIGNANCY.**
    8.  **Evade host immune response:** Antigen masking, MHC loss, immunosuppression.

### Important Regulatory Genes (4 Major Categories)
*   **Proto-oncogenes:** Involved in normal cell growth/repair (Abl, HER, Myc, Ras) - **growth promoting**.
*   **Tumor suppressor genes:** Protect against unregulated cell growth (APC, BRCA, p53) - **growth inhibiting**.
*   **DNA repair genes:** Maintain genomic stability (BRCA1/2, Mismatch repair).
*   **Anti-apoptosis genes:** Overexpression prevents apoptosis (Bcl-2); mutations prevent programmed cell death.

### Key Genes in Cancer (Know These 3!)
**1. RAS Oncogene (Signal Transducer)**
*   Most common proto-oncogene abnormality in humans (15-20% of all cancers).
*   **Types:** HRAS, KRAS, NRAS.
*   **Point mutation** = single most common abnormality.
*   **Associations:** KRAS (colon, pancreas), HRAS (bladder), NRAS (hematopoietic).
*   **Mechanism:** Normal RAS flips between active (GTP-bound) and inactive (GDP-bound). Mutated RAS is **permanently activated** (cannot hydrolyze GTP) → continuous proliferation signal.

**2. MYC Oncogene (Nuclear Regulator/Transcription Factor)**
*   Activates expression of many genes involved in cell growth.
*   **Deregulation mechanisms:**
    *   **Translocation** in Burkitt lymphoma.
    *   **Amplification** in breast, colon, lung cancers → overexpression.
    *   Sometimes upregulates telomerase (contributes to endless replication).
*   **Variants:** N-Myc (neuroblastoma), L-Myc (small cell lung cancer).

**3. p53 Tumor Suppressor Gene ("Molecular Policeman")**
*   **Location:** Chromosome 17.
*   **Mutated in >50% of tumors** - most common tumor suppressor gene mutation.
*   **Normal Functions:** Regulates cell cycle progression, DNA repair, senescence, apoptosis. Prevents neoplastic transformation via:
    *   Temporary cell cycle arrest (quiescence) via **p21**.
    *   Permanent cell cycle arrest (senescence).
    *   Triggering apoptosis (induces **BAX**).
*   **Checkpoints:** Required for G1/S checkpoint, main component of G2/M checkpoint.
*   **Mechanism:** Homozygous loss (biallelic loss-of-function mutations). Most sporadic cancers require "two hits" (both alleles mutated).
*   **Mechanism:** Homozygous loss (biallelic loss-of-function mutations). Most sporadic cancers require "two hits" (both alleles mutated).

**Li-Fraumeni Syndrome**
*   **Defect:** Germline mutation in **TP53** (one mutant allele inherited).
*   **Mechanism:** Only one somatic "hit" needed to lose p53 function (Two-Hit Hypothesis).
*   **Risk:** 25-fold increased risk of malignancy by age 50.
*   **Cancers:** **SBLA** (Sarcoma, Breast, Leukemia, Adrenal).
:::

### Warburg Effect (Aerobic Glycolysis)
*   **Definition:** Cancer cells use **glycolysis** even in the presence of ample oxygen (aerobic glycolysis), converting glucose to **lactate** (NOT lactose - typo in some texts!).
*   **Why?** While inefficient for ATP (2 ATP vs 36 ATP from oxidative phosphorylation), it provides **metabolic intermediates** needed for biosynthesis of cellular components (proteins, lipids, nucleic acids).

**PET Scans & The Warburg Effect**
*   **Principle:** Cancer cells exhibit **"Glucose Hunger"** (high glucose uptake) due to aerobic glycolysis.
*   **Imaging:** **PET Scans** use a glucose analog (**18F-FDG**) to visualize metabolically active tumors.
*   **Note:** Also highlights normal tissues with high glucose use (brain, heart).

## Part 2: Cancer Growth and Metastasis
*   **Tumor Growth Kinetics:**
    *   **Doubling Time:** Time it takes for tumor mass to double.
    *   **Growth Fraction:** Proportion of cells actively dividing. Chemotherapy targets high growth fraction cells.
*   **Steps of Metastasis:**
    1.  **Invasion:** Loosening of cell-cell contacts (loss of E-cadherin), degradation of ECM (MMPs), migration.
    2.  **Intravasation:** Entering blood or lymph vessels.
    3.  **Survival in Circulation:** Evasion of immune system (antigen masking, MHC loss, immunosuppression).
    4.  **Extravasation:** Exiting vessels at distant site.
    5.  **Colonization:** Growth at secondary site (requires angiogenesis).
*   **Pathways of Spread:**
    *   **Lymphatic:** Typical for Carcinomas (spread to regional nodes).
    *   **Hematogenous:** Typical for Sarcomas (spread to lungs, liver, bone, brain). Also Renal Cell Carcinoma, Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
    *   **Seeding:** Spread within body cavities (e.g., Ovarian cancer in peritoneal cavity).

## Part 3: Oncogenic Microbes
*   **Viruses:**
    *   **HPV (Human Papillomavirus):** Cervical, anal, oropharyngeal cancers (E6 inhibits p53, E7 inhibits Rb).
    *   **EBV (Epstein-Barr Virus):** Burkitt lymphoma, Nasopharyngeal carcinoma, CNS lymphoma in HIV.
    *   **HBV/HCV (Hepatitis B/C):** Hepatocellular carcinoma.
    *   **HHV-8 (Kaposi Sarcoma Herpesvirus):** Kaposi sarcoma (in AIDS).
    *   **HTLV-1:** Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma.
*   **Bacteria:**
    *   ***Helicobacter pylori*:** Gastric adenocarcinoma, MALT lymphoma.
*   **Parasites:**
    *   ***Schistosoma haematobium*:** Squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder.
    *   ***Clonorchis sinensis*:** Cholangiocarcinoma.

## Part 4: Paraneoplastic Syndromes
*   **Definition:** Symptom complexes that cannot be explained by the local or distant spread of the tumor or by the elaboration of hormones indigenous to the tissue of origin.
*   **Prevalence:** ~10% of persons with malignant disease.
*   **Significance:** May be **earliest manifestation** of occult neoplasm.
*   **Endocrine:**
    *   **Cushing Syndrome:** Ectopic ACTH production (Small cell lung cancer).
    *   **SIADH:** Ectopic ADH production (Small cell lung cancer) → hyponatremia.
    *   **Hypercalcemia:** PTHrP production (Squamous cell lung cancer, Breast, Renal).
*   **Neurologic:**
    *   **Anti-NMDA Receptor Encephalitis:** Ovarian teratoma.
    *   **Limbic Encephalitis:** Small cell lung cancer.
    *   **Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome:** Antibodies against presynaptic Ca²⁺ channels (Small cell lung cancer).
    *   **Myasthenia Gravis:** Thymoma.
*   **Skin/Musculoskeletal:**
    *   **Acanthosis Nigricans:** Gastric carcinoma.
    *   **Hypertrophic Osteoarthropathy:** Clubbing of fingers (Lung cancer).
*   **Other:** Vascular/hematological changes, nephrotic syndrome, bone/joint/soft tissue changes.
