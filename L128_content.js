    summary: `# Lecture #128: Pathology of Cellular Adaptation and Cellular Injury

**Lecturer:** Maria M. Plummer, M.D.
**Session:** Lecture #128

-----

## Part 1: Cellular Adaptations

:::slides 7-17
* **Slide 7:** Hypertrophy (increased size)
* **Slide 17:** Hyperplasia (increased number)
:::

Cells are constantly exposed to stress. To survive, they must adapt. If the stress is excessive or the cell cannot adapt, injury occurs.

### Hypertrophy
**Hypertrophy** is an increase in the **size** of cells, leading to an increase in the size of the organ.
*   **Key Point:** Occurs in **permanent tissues** (skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, nerve tissue) that **cannot proliferate**. These cells can only get bigger via hypertrophy.
*   **Physiologic:** Uterus during pregnancy, skeletal muscle in bodybuilders.
*   **Pathologic:** Cardiac hypertrophy in hypertension (left ventricle works harder against resistance), aortic stenosis.
*   **Mechanism:** Mechanical sensors and growth factors activate signaling pathways (PI3K/AKT, GPCRs) -> increased protein synthesis.

### Hyperplasia
**Hyperplasia** is an increase in the **number** of cells. It occurs in tissues capable of replication.
*   **Physiologic:** Breast development at puberty/pregnancy, liver regeneration.
*   **Pathologic:** Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH), Endometrial Hyperplasia (inappropriate/excessive hormonal stimulation).
*   **Note:** Hyperplasia is controlled; if the signal stops, it stops. This distinguishes it from neoplasia (cancer), though it can be a fertile soil for cancer development.
*   **Important:** Hyperplasia and hypertrophy can occur **together** in some tissues/organs but usually **not** in skeletal/cardiac muscle and nerve tissue.

:::clinical
**Clinical Correlate: Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH)**

An elderly male presents with difficulty urinating (hesitancy, dribbling) and nocturia. This is due to hyperplasia of the prostate glandular and stromal cells, which compresses the urethra.

**Clinical Signs:**
- Urinary frequency and urgency
- Weak stream
- Nocturia
:::

### Atrophy
**Atrophy** is a decrease in cell size and number.
*   **Causes:** Disuse (cast), loss of innervation, diminished blood supply, inadequate nutrition, loss of endocrine stimulation (menopause).
*   **Mechanism:** Decreased protein synthesis and increased protein degradation (Ubiquitin-Proteasome pathway). Autophagy also plays a role.

### Metaplasia
**Metaplasia** is a reversible change where one adult cell type is replaced by another adult cell type better able to withstand the stress.
*   **Example:** In smokers, the fragile ciliated columnar epithelium of the trachea is replaced by tough stratified squamous epithelium.
*   **Cost:** Loss of function (ciliary clearance), which predisposes to infection.
*   **Barrett's Esophagus:** Squamous to columnar metaplasia in the distal esophagus due to acid reflux (GERD).

:::clinical
**Clinical Correlate: Barrett's Esophagus**

Chronic acid reflux causes the stratified squamous epithelium of the lower esophagus to change into intestinal-type columnar epithelium (with goblet cells). This is a precursor lesion to esophageal adenocarcinoma.

## Part 2: Cellular Injury and Death

:::slides 35-48
* **Slide 35-36:** Reversible injury (swelling)
* **Slide 41, 48:** Irreversible injury (necrosis)
:::

If adaptation fails, injury ensues.

### Reversible Injury
*   **Hallmark:** **Cellular swelling** (hydropic change, vacuolar degeneration, edema)
*   **Cause:** Failure of the **Na+/K+ pump** (ATP depletion) → Na enters cell, water follows → cell swells
*   **Note:** This is **reversible** because the plasma membrane pump can be restored if ATP is replenished
*   **Other sign:** Fatty change (steatosis) in the liver

### Irreversible Injury (After 20-30 minutes)
*   **Membrane damage** (plasma, mitochondrial, lysosomal)
*   **Mitochondrial dysfunction** (inability to generate ATP)
*   **Increased anaerobic glycolysis** → ↓ glycogen, ↑ lactic acid, ↓ pH (chromatin clumping)
*   **Failure of Ca²⁺ pump** → Ca enters cell → activates destructive enzymes (phospholipases, proteases, endonucleases, ATPases)
*   **Result:** Denaturation of proteins, enzymatic digestion, contents leak out → **inflammation**

### Nuclear Changes in Necrosis
1.  **Pyknosis:** Nuclear shrinkage and increased basophilia.
2.  **Karyorrhexis:** Fragmentation of the pyknotic nucleus.
3.  **Karyolysis:** Fading of the nucleus (digestion by DNase).

## Part 3: Patterns of Tissue Necrosis

:::slides 50-58
* **Slide 50:** Coagulative Necrosis
* **Slide 53:** Liquefactive Necrosis
* **Slide 55:** Caseous Necrosis
:::

### Coagulative Necrosis
*   **Cause:** Ischemia (infarction).
*   **Features:** Architecture is preserved for days (ghost cells). Proteins denature.
*   **Location:** All solid organs (Heart, Kidney, Spleen) **EXCEPT the brain**.

### Liquefactive Necrosis
*   **Cause:** Bacterial/Fungal infections, or Ischemia in the **Brain**.
*   **Features:** Digestion of dead cells results in a liquid viscous mass (pus).

### Caseous Necrosis
*   **Cause:** Tuberculosis (TB).
*   **Features:** "Cheese-like" friable white appearance. Granuloma formation.

### Fat Necrosis
*   **Cause:** Acute Pancreatitis or trauma to breast.
*   **Features:** Chalky white deposits (saponification) due to fatty acids combining with calcium.

### Fibrinoid Necrosis
*   **Cause:** Immune complex deposition (Vasculitis, Malignant Hypertension).
*   **Features:** Bright pink amorphous appearance in vessel walls.

-----

## Part 4: Apoptosis

:::slides 60-68
* **Slide 67:** Mitochondrial Pathway
* **Slide 68:** Death Receptor Pathway
:::

**Apoptosis** is programmed cell death. It is tightly regulated and does **NOT** elicit inflammation (unlike necrosis).
*   **Physiologic:** Embryogenesis (webbed fingers), hormone withdrawal (menstruation), elimination of self-reactive lymphocytes.
*   **Pathologic:** DNA damage (radiation), accumulation of misfolded proteins.

### Mechanisms
1.  **Intrinsic (Mitochondrial) Pathway:** Triggered by cell injury/stress. **Bcl-2** family sensors activate **Bax/Bak**, creating channels in the mitochondria. **Cytochrome c** leaks out and activates **Caspase 9**.
2.  **Extrinsic (Death Receptor) Pathway:** Triggered by receptor-ligand interactions (Fas/FasL, TNF). Activates **Caspase 8**.

Both pathways converge on **Executioner Caspases (3, 6, 7)** which chew up the cytoskeleton and DNA.

## Part 5: Intracellular Accumulations (Pigments)

:::slides 70-75
* **Slide 70:** Anthracosis
* **Slide 72:** Hemosiderin
* **Slide 74:** Lipofuscin
:::

Cells may accumulate abnormal amounts of various substances:

### Anthracosis
*   **What:** Carbon/coal dust accumulation
*   **Where:** Lungs
*   **Who:** Heavy smokers, people in polluted areas, coal miners
*   **Appearance:** Black pigment in lung tissue and lymph nodes

### Hemosiderin
*   **What:** Iron-containing pigment derived from hemoglobin
*   **Where:** Sites of old hemorrhage, liver, spleen
*   **Stain:** Prussian blue (iron stain)
*   **Clinical:** Seen in bruises, hemochromatosis

### Lipofuscin
*   **What:** "Wear and tear" pigment
*   **Association:** Aging cells (especially neurons, cardiac myocytes)
*   **Appearance:** Yellow-brown granules
*   **Significance:** Marker of free radical injury and lipid peroxidation over time`,
    questions: `**1. A 60-year-old man with a history of hypertension dies from a stroke. Autopsy reveals a heart weighing 550 grams (normal <350g) with a thickened left ventricular wall. Which of the following cellular adaptations best explains this finding?**

A. Hyperplasia
B. Hypertrophy
C. Atrophy
D. Metaplasia
E. Dysplasia

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to Reveal Answer</strong></summary>

**Answer: B (Hypertrophy)**

**Rationale**: The heart is composed of permanent cells (cardiac myocytes) that cannot divide. Therefore, in response to increased workload (hypertension), the cells must increase in **size** (hypertrophy) rather than number (hyperplasia).
</details>

**2. A 45-year-old woman presents with severe abdominal pain. Laboratory tests show elevated pancreatic enzymes (amylase and lipase). Which type of necrosis is most likely to be found in the peripancreatic fat?**

A. Coagulative necrosis
B. Liquefactive necrosis
C. Caseous necrosis
D. Fat necrosis
E. Fibrinoid necrosis

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to Reveal Answer</strong></summary>

**Answer: D (Fat necrosis)**

**Rationale**: Acute pancreatitis leads to the release of activated pancreatic enzymes that digest adipose tissue. The released fatty acids combine with calcium to form chalky white deposits (saponification), characteristic of **fat necrosis**.
</details>

**3. Which of the following is a feature of irreversible cell injury?**

A. Cellular swelling
B. Fatty change
C. Ribosomal detachment
D. Membrane defects
E. Loss of microvilli

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to Reveal Answer</strong></summary>

**Answer: D (Membrane defects)**

**Rationale**: **Membrane damage** (plasma membrane, mitochondrial membrane, lysosomal membrane) is a hallmark of **irreversible** injury. Cellular swelling, fatty change, ribosomal detachment, and loss of microvilli are typically reversible if the stress is removed.
</details>

**4. A 30-year-old man presents with a chronic cough and weight loss. A chest X-ray shows a cavitary lesion in the upper lobe of the right lung. Biopsy reveals a granuloma with a central area of amorphous, granular debris. What type of necrosis is this?**

A. Coagulative necrosis
B. Liquefactive necrosis
C. Caseous necrosis
D. Fat necrosis
E. Gangrenous necrosis

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to Reveal Answer</strong></summary>

**Answer: C (Caseous necrosis)**

**Rationale**: **Caseous necrosis** is characteristic of **tuberculosis**. It appears "cheese-like" (white and friable) and is often associated with granulomas.
</details>

---

**5. Which of the following molecules is a key initiator of the intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway of apoptosis?**

A. Fas ligand
B. TNF
C. Cytochrome c
D. Caspase 8
E. Perforin

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to Reveal Answer</strong></summary>

**Answer: C (Cytochrome c)**

**Rationale**: The **intrinsic pathway** is triggered by mitochondrial damage, leading to the leakage of **cytochrome c** into the cytoplasm. Cytochrome c binds to Apaf-1 and activates **Caspase 9**. Fas ligand and TNF are involved in the extrinsic pathway (Caspase 8).
