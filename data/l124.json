  "summary": "\n\n**Lecturer:** Unknown Lecturer\n**Session:** Lecture #124\n\n-----\n\n## Overview\nAminoglycosides are protein synthesis inhibitors (30S subunit). They are bactericidal and concentration-dependent.\n**Mechanism:** Bind to 30S ribosome -> misreading of mRNA -> non-functional proteins.\n**Synergy:** Often used with cell wall inhibitors (Beta-lactams, Vancomycin) to facilitate entry.\n\n## Spectrum\n**Aerobic Gram-Negative Bacilli** (Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, etc.).\n**NO Anaerobic coverage** (require O2 for uptake).\n\n## Adverse Effects\n1.  **Nephrotoxicity:** Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN). Reversible.\n2.  **Ototoxicity:** Cochlear (hearing loss) and Vestibular (balance). Often irreversible.\n3.  **Neuromuscular Blockade:** Contraindicated in Myasthenia Gravis.\n",

        "Aminoglycosides cannot penetrate the anaerobic cell wall"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "rationale": "The transport of aminoglycosides across the bacterial cell membrane is an energy-dependent process that requires oxygen. Therefore, strict anaerobes are intrinsically resistant."
