GABA  - Inhibition
The neurotransmitters glycine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) inhibit the firing of 
neurons
The activity of GABA is increased by benzodiazepines (e.g., Valium) and by anticonvulsant 
drugs (e.g., Valproate) 
Ethanol exerts many effects via GABA agonism (GABAA  receptor allosteric modulator)
In Huntington’s disease, the GABA-producing neurons in brain centers that coordinate 
movement degenerate, thereby causing uncontrollable movements
Two kinds of receptors GABAA (ionotropic) and GABAB (metabotropic).

Acetylcholine
Choline acetyl transferase (ChA T) in an enzyme 
needed to produce acetylcholine
ChA T can be used to mark cholinergic cells
ChA T positive cells are decreased in Alzheimer’s 
disease patient brain
Decreased cholinergic signaling may be involved 
with Alzheimer’s disease symptoms

Serotonin (5-HT)
Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is an indoleamine present 
in the brain, and other tissues, particularly blood platelets and 
the lining of the digestive tract.
In the brain, 5-HT has been implicated in sleep, mood, 
depression and anxiety.
Drugs that alter 5-HT synaptic
levels such as Fluoxetine,
relieve symptoms of depression
and obsessive-compulsive
disorder.

Serotonin Synthetic Pathway
Selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors (SSRIs) such as 
Fluoxetine block reuptake 
transporters and thereby 
increasing serotonin signaling to 
modify depressive symptoms
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors 
(MAOIs) inhibit degradation of 
serotonin and other monoamine 
neurotransmitters

ATP and Adenosine
ATP is the energy currency of the cell, and 
it can be released via channels, vesicles 
and cell death.
Extracellular enzymes hydrolase ATP to 
Adenosine.  
ATP and Adenosine are released by neurons 
and glia and affect both neurons and glia 
through purinergic receptors.
Astrocyte derived Adenosine and ATP is a 
driver of sleep pressure (drive to seek 
sleep) and circadian rhythm.
Caffeine promotes wakefulness primarily 
by inhibiting adenosine receptors .

Nitric oxide
Nitric oxide and carbon monoxide are gases that 
also serve as neurotransmitters.
Being gases, they are not stored in any structure.
Instead, they are made by enzymes (e.g., NOS) as 
they are needed and released from neurons by 
diffusion
Neuromodulator and vasodilator.
