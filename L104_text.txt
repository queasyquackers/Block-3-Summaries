Pharyngeal Apparatus Derivatives: Muscles
Somitomeres
• Units of paraxial mesoderm in the head, 
but not distinct as in the body.
• Somitomeres are involved in formation 
of Arch 1, 2, 3 muscles.
• The tongue muscles originate from more 
caudal somites, hence their innervation 
from CN XII (hypoglossal n.).

Tongue Development
Source: ScienceDirect; Head and Neck Imaging 4e
The sensory and mucosal aspects of the tongue is formed from swellings in 
Pharyngeal Arch 1–4.
• Arch 1 forms mucosa of anterior 2/3 of the tongue.
• Arch 2 is overgrown by arch 3 but provides taste innervation to anterior 2/3.
• Arch 3 and 4 form mucosa of posterior 1/3 of the tongue.
Tongue muscles form from occipital somites (hence CN XII motor innervation).
--- Page 46 ---
Tongue Development
Source: ScienceDirect; Head and Neck Imaging 4e
The complex origin of the tongue is why it is 
innervated by several cranial nerves.

Thyroid Development

descends, forming a thyroglossal duct.

Clinical Correlate
  Thyroglossal Duct Cyst, Sinus; Pyramidal Lobe
Thyroglossal Duct Sinus Thyroglossal Duct Cyst Ectopic Thyroid Gland
• Thyroglossal duct cyst forms in the midline (not lateral) of the neck from incomplete closure of the thyroglossal 
duct. Rupture of this cyst from infection, creates a sinus. 
• Ectopic thyroid gland is the existence of gland tissue along the path of the thyroglossal duct (common).
--- Page 51 ---
Placodes
Placodes: ectodermal discs that form special 
sense organs of the head.
• nasal placode > mucosa of nasal cavity
• lens placode > lens of the eye
• otic placode > vestibule & cochlea of the ear
• neurogenic placodes > parts of CNs
• nasal placode associated with CN I
• lens placode associated with CN II
• otic placode associated with CN VIII

Development of the Face
Source: ScienceDirect; BBC
Facial Primordia
• Frontonasal prominence: forms the 
forehead and dorsum/apex of nose.
• Lateral nasal prominences: form sides of the 
nose.
• Medial nasal prominences: form the 
intermaxillary segment that eventually gives 
rise to the nasal septum, middle part of upper 
lip, and philtrum (medial cleft).
• Left & right maxillary prominences: 
form upper cheek regions and upper 
lip.
• Left & right mandibular prominences: 
form lower jaw, lower lip, and lower 
cheek regions.

Clinical Correlate
  Cleft Lip, Cleft Palate
Source: ScienceDirect
The palate forms through two stages
• Primary palate: extension of the intermaxillary segment from the nasal prominences.
• Secondary palate: joining of the palatine process from the maxillary prominences.
--- Page 55 ---
Source: ScienceDirect; The Developing Human: Clinically Oriented Embryology 9e 
Cleft Lip & Palate: caused by incomplete 
closure of the maxilla and/or palate. Occurs in 1 
in ~1,000 births.
• Results in abnormal facial appearance, 
defective speech.
• Treatment involves surgery and any therapies 
(e.g., speech) to improve related conditions.

Skull Development
3 Embryonic Components:
chondrocranium: endochondral cranial base 
that later ossifies
• occipital, sphenoid, ethmoid, temporal (petrous part)
desmocranium: membranous bone to the 
sides and tops of braincase; forms the 
calvaria
• frontal, occipital, parietal
viscerocranium: derived from pharyngeal 
arches via membranous ossification.
• temporal (squamous part), maxilla, zygomatic, mandible

Clinical Correlate
  Craniosynostosis, Microcephaly, Hydrocephalus
Source: Humanitas Charity; Science
Microcephaly: caused by 
abnormal development of the 
brain, rather than premature 
closure of sutures. Often 
results in mental deficiency.
Hydrocephalus: caused by 
elevated pressure in 
ventricles due to CSF 
buildup (resulting in 
enlarged brain ventricles). 
Occurs 1 in ~1,000 births.
Craniosynostosis: deformity in the 
cranium due to premature closure of 
sutures/fontanelles. Type of defect depends 
on which suture closes prematurely.

Pituitary

Pituitary Gland: pea-sized endocrine 
gland that receives signal from the 
brain via the hypothalamus and 
produces hormones for the entire body.

Pituitary

Anterior and posterior lobes have completely different origins!
Anterior lobe: from 
upgrowth of ectodermal 
roof of the mouth 
(hypophyseal pouch).
Posterior lobe: from 
downgrowth of floor of 
embryonic brain (also 
ectodermal in origin) 
(neurohypophyseal bud).

Neural Crest Cells
• Ectoderm-derived but forms secondary 
mesenchyme (mesectoderm) to form 
“mesoderm”-derived structures.
• Migrates all over the body to turn into cartilage 
and bone, teeth, skin, melanocytes, smooth 
muscles, glands, adipose tissue, neurons, glia, 
adrenal medulla, etc.
• Responsible for most of the connective and 
skeletal tissue of the head, nerves, and pigment 
cells
