Mechanics of Ingestion
Ingestion & Respiration
1. Food is pushed back by 
elevating the tongue.
2. Soft palate and uvula 
elevates to close path into 
nasopharynx
3. Sequential contraction 
of pharyngeal constrictor 
muscles moves food down

Mechanics of Ingestion
Ingestion & Respiration
Infants can ingest and breathe at the same time.
• Larynx and epiglottis sit more superiorly than 
in adults.
• Epiglottis and soft palate interlock allowing 
liquid food to pass laterally and bypass entry 
into the larynx & trachea.

Paranasal Sinuses
4 Paranasal Sinuses:
• paired
• connected to nasal cavity 
via foramina (ostia)
• Functions:
• lighten skull weight
• humidify & heat inhaled 
air
• Increase resonance for 
hearing
• Ostia often become blocked 
by allergic inflammation or 
swelling of nasal lining from 
common cold. This prevents 
drainage of mucus that 
leads to facial pain.

  “Danger Zone” #1 (of 3)
Types of Intracranial Hemorrhage/Hematoma Intracranial hemorrhage/hematoma: 
Blood accumulation in the endocranial 
(brain) cavity, resulting in life 
threatening compression of the brain. 
1. Epidural hematoma: between skull 
and dura mater. 
2. Subdural hematoma: between 
dura mater and arachnoid mater. 
Common when bridging veins and 
sagittal sinus is torn.
3. Subarachnoid hemorrhage: 
between arachnoid mater and pia 
mater. Common when cerebral 
arteries rupture.

Facial vein has no valves, so 
blood may drain superiorly into 
superior & inferior ophthalmic 
veins and enter the cavernous 
sinus.
Infection around the nose (e.g., 
pimples, boils) can spread into 
cavernous sinus where important 
arteries and nerves are located.

Salivary glands secrete directly into the oral 
cavity.
Parotid gland: located anterior to the ears 
in posterior cheek region. Secretes copious 
watery saliva (parasympathetic); small 
amount of viscous saliva (sympathetic).
Submandibular gland: located below the 
mandible. Secretions travel through 
submandibular duct.
Sublingual gland: located in the floor of 
the mouth. Secretions travels superiorly 
through numerous small ducts.
Salivary Glands

Lacrimal Apparatus
Lacrimal gland: located superior-lateral 
to the eye. Secretes tears through 
lacrimal ducts.
Lacrimal canaliculi: drain tears from 
lacrimal punctum (where two canaliculi 
meet) into the lacrimal sac.
Lacrimal sac: drains tears into the 
nasolacrimal duct which opens inferiorly 
into the nasal cavity.
Drainage can be blocked by injury or 
infection, which can lead to irritated eye.

Thyroid: takes up iodine from food to produce 
thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) (essential 
for growth). Productions controlled by thyroid-
stimulating hormone from the pituitary gland.
Parathyroid glands: produces parathyroid 
hormone (PTH) for regulating calcium and 
phosphorus metabolism. Controlled by the pituitary 
and hypothalamus.
Thymus: produces thymosin that promotes 
differentiation and maturation in T-lymphocyte 
precursors transported from the bone marrow.

 Thyroid Gland Diseases
Goiter: enlargement of the thyroid gland, 
presented as lump on anterior aspect of the 
neck. Often due to iodine deficiency. Could 
be associated with:
Hyperthyroidism: overproduction of 
thyroid hormones.
Hypothyroidism: underproduction of 
thyroid hormones. Glands swell to try to 
produce more hormones.
Could cause breathing/swallowing 
difficulties or speech loss due to 
compression of the trachea, larynx, 
esophagus, recurrent laryngeal nerve.
