Neuronal resting membrane potential (rVm)
• Neuronal membrane changes, 
electric activity, and synaptic 
connections creates behavior!
• rVm of neuron is “hyperpolarized” 
(more negative) relative to the 
extracellular side.
• rVm is ~ -65mV in many central 
neurons but can vary by +/-15mV.
• Membrane potential physiology 
also important to understand 
cardiovascular function. 3

Resting membrane potential of neurons
• Hyperpolarized rVm is established 
by… 
• 1] Na/K pump ->> 3Na+ out / 2K+ in
• 2] membrane channels selectively 
permeable to certain ions “leak” K+ and 
“leak” Na+ channels.
• 40X more “leak” K than “leak” Na
• 3] unequal concentration of charged 
ions present in the intra vs. 
extracellular space determine direction 
and extent of ion flow.

Conclusions (Part 1):
• Neurons exhibit a negative resting membrane potential 
due to…
• Na/K pump
• Membrane channels selectively permeable to certain ions 
especially leak K+ (minimal leak Na+ channels)
• 40:1 permeability ratio between K+ vs Na+ leak channels
• Unequal concentration of charged ions present in the 
intra vs. extracellular space determine direction and 
extent of ion flow and membrane potential change.

Action Potentials (APs)
APs are the information carrying electrical signal of 
neurons about the external world, motor commands, 
emotions, etc.
Neurons have a threshold for AP generation – 
depolarization to      ~-40mV then… bang!  
What determines the AP threshold? –  the “voltage-
gating” of voltage-gated Na+ channels (activation 
voltage ~-40mV)
APs are generated by the activation of voltage -gated 
Na+ and K+ channels.
Travel down the axon and cause neurotransmitter 
release which is used to communicate across neuronal 
connections (synaptic transmission).

Channel inactivation is produced by a separate part of the protein – “known as the inactivation gate”
Genetic mutations that affect the “inactivation gate” result in channels being open for too long – EPILEPSY!
Drugs have been developed to modify channel inactivation – speed up or slow down inactivation.

4 Phases of the AP
• 1. Rising phase = initial rapid depolarization – opening of voltage-gated Na+ channels 
• 2. Overshoot = portion of the AP that is depolarized > 0mV – opening, closing, inactivation of 
Na+ channels and opening of K+ channels.
• 3. Falling phase = rapid hyperpolarization – opening of voltage gated K+ channels
• 4. Undershoot = portion of AP that is hyperpolarized past resting Vm toward (EK+, -80mV) - 
closing of K+ channels.

Clinical correlates: Mechanisms of neurotoxins
Tetrodotoxin (TTX)
 - potent sodium channel blocker
 - found in symbiotic bacteria in Pufferfish eg. genus Lagocephalus
 - eaten in small amounts causes tingling and 
 numbness of the mouth.
 - eaten in large amounts can cause limb weakness,
  respiratory failure and cardiac arrest
 - symptom onset varies from immediately to ~15mins
Saxitoxin 
 - potent sodium channel blocker
 - produced by dinoflagellates found in shellfish
 - causes "paralytic shellfish poisoning“
 - similar symptoms as in TTX poisoning
α-dendrotoxin
 - potent potassium channel blocker (Kv1)
 - found in venom of the green mamba Dendroaspis angusticeps
 - prolongs action potentials affecting neuro and cardiovascular 
function

Conclusions (Part 2):
• The neuronal membrane contains voltage -gated Na+ and 
K+ channels that contribute to the generation of the 
action potential
• The action potential has distinct phases which are 
produced by the sequential opening and closing of Na+ 
and K+ channels
• Action potential generation can be modified by ion 
channel blockers such as TTX and lidocaine and 
Journavx.
• Gene mutations affecting voltage gated Na+ channels 
produce pain syndromes

Glutamate synapses depolarize the postsynaptic neuron
- AP induced release of Glutamate into cleft
- Ionotropic glutamate receptors (AMPA) have a Na+ pore. 
   Glu binding opens channel and Na+ rushes into the cell 
  (some K+ out of the cell).
- Depolarizes postsynaptic neuron which might
       contribute to AP generation in postsynaptic neuron.

creates behavior!    Sensation & movement response

causing contraction.

Conclusions (Part 3):
• Neurons are connect to one another via chemical 
and electrical synapses
• The postsynaptic effect of a given neurotransmitter 
will depend on the type of transmitter itself as well 
as the type of receptor found on the postsynaptic 
neuron (ionotropic vs. metabotropic)
• All of the players (neurons, channels, myelin, 
transmitters, etc) involved in synaptic transmission 
are vulnerable to perturbation in disease and are 
drug-able targets for therapy.
